524,I'll take care of everything.
525,MAN: I don't have a minute.
526,You've made me late enough.
527,I am so tired of dealing with incompetence.
528,"It says 100% guaranteed, you moron!"
529,"Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass."
530,Is there a problem here?
531,"Can I help you, sir?"
532,You bet you have a problem.
533,Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence.
534,I'm surprised. I eat here all the time and usually have good service.
535,All I wanted was my money back on this breakfast.
536,It was a little undercooked.
537,And he threatens me with violence.
538,I'm gonna call your...
539,I can take care of it.
540,"Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?"
541,He insulted me first.
542,"He called me a moron, Dennis."
543,Answer me! Did you threaten this customer or use profanity?
544,Yes.
545,You're fired.
546,"DENNIS: I'm very sorry, sir."
547,I'll refund your money right now.
548,I hope you won't hold this against us.
549,You know how these young kids are these days.
550,DENNIS: Here we are.
551,Perhaps another breakfast?
552,"I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!"
553,NAHAN: The world's finest surfers showed up today to do battle with what's turned out to be the biggest waves to hit this coast since 1946.
554,Hello.
555,"I'm Stu Nahan, and I'd like you to meet this young man."
556,"His name, Jeff Spicoli."
557,"Jeff, congratulations."
558,Things looked rough out there today.
559,"I'll tell you, Stu, I did battle with some humongous waves."
560,"Just like I told the guy on ABC, ""Danger is my business."" A lot of people expected Mark ""Cutback"" Davis, or Bob ""Jungle Vet"" Gerard would take the honors this year."
561,Those guys are fags!
562,That's fantastic.
563,Let me ask you.
564,"When you get out there, do you ever fear for your life?"
565,"Stu, surfing's not a sport."
566,It's a way of life.
567,It's no hobby.
568,"It's a way of looking at that wave and saying, ""Hey, bud, let's party!"" Where'd you get this jacket?"
569,From the network.
570,"Let me ask you, what's next for Jeff Spicoli?"
571,Headed over to the Australian and then the Hawaiian Internationals.
572,Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over to London and jam with the Stones.
573,"You guys are invited, too."
574,CURTIS: Jeff! Jeff!
575,"Jeff, Dad says you have to get up."
576,Leave me alone.
577,"Dad says you're gonna be late again, you butthole!"
578,Leave me alone!
579,"Dad says you're gonna be late again, you booger!"
580,"Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!"
581,We just want to say that we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.
582,We always hated that name.
583,It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.
584,It's just such a putdown!
585,Really!
586,"We know you've got a lot of spirit, everybody, right?"
587,And we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week! All right!
588,"You know, it takes a lot of courage to get up here and do something that you know people will make fun of."
589,GIRL: Yeah.
590,Man...
591,I'm never gonna talk to those guys again.
592,I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave their jobs there in the first place.
593,"If you'd apologize to Dennis, I'm sure he'd take you back."
594,Fuck Dennis Taylor!
595,I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.
596,"I'm just glad we're still together because a lot's happened, and I really need you this year."
597,"Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this."
598,We're almost out of school.
599,It's our last year.
600,And I think we owe it to ourselves to be free.
601,To go out with other people.
602,I still want to be friends.
603,What do I say to her once we get in the car?
604,"No problem, Rat."
605,What you need is my special fivepoint plan.
606,"Come on, Damone, I need real help."
607,What do you mean?
608,Men have died trying to obtain this valuable information.
609,But I'll give it to you for free.
610,What's your fivepoint plan?
611,All right.
612,"Now, pay attention."
613,"First of all, you never let on how much you like a girl."
614,"Oh, Debbie. Hi."
615,Two. You always call the shots.
616,"Kiss me, you won't regret it."
617,"Three. Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be."
618,Isn't this great?
619,Four.
620,"When ordering food, you find out what she wants then order for the both of you."
621,It's a classy move.
622,"The lady will have the linguine in a white clam sauce, and a Coke with no ice."
623,And five.
624,"Now, this is most important, Rat."
625,"When it comes down to making out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV."
626,This is a nice car.
627,Yeah. It's my sister's.
628,Yeah?
629,Do you have Mrs. George for English?
630,Yeah.
631,She's pretty good.
632,"Yeah, she is pretty good."
633,Have you decided?
634,"Um, yeah."
635,I'll have the knockwurst.
636,Excellent.
637,"You work at Cinema Four, right?"
638,That must be great.
639,You get to see all those free movies.
640,You get free popcorn.
641,Are you okay?
642,"Yeah, I'm fine."
643,Would you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
644,"Oh, no, go ahead."
645,Are you ready to order here?
646,She will have the knockwurst.
647,And you?
648,I'll have the same.
649,Anything to drink?
650,Coke.
651,Two Cokes.
652,Okay. Thank you.
653,I'll be right back.
654,Okay.
655,Hello?
656,"Mike, it's Mark."
657,What happened to your date?
658,MARK: It's happening right now.
659,Everything's fine except I left my wallet at home.
660,Why don't you go home and get it?
661,"No, I can't! I'm here."
662,The food's coming and everything.
663,"Look, would you do me a favor?"
664,Just borrow your mom's car.
665,"Drive to my house, get my wallet and bring it here."
666,Hello? Mike?
667,Mike?
668,"Geez, I'm really kind of busy, Rat."
669,Just do me this one favor.
670,I swear I won't ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other.
671,But just please do this for me.
672,You owe me for this one.
673,"Okay, thanks."
674,Thanks a lot. Thanks.
675,"Beaver, are you all right?"
676,What happened?
677,Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
678,Do you want another Coke?
679,"Um, okay."
680,Two more Cokes.
681,"Hey, Mark, is that you?"
682,"Yeah, hi."
683,You come here?
684,Yeah. I come for the strudel.
685,It's great.
686,"Hey, listen, I found your wallet the other day."
687,You want it back?
688,"Oh, wow! Yeah."
689,I was looking for this.
690,"Oh, Mike, you don't know Stacy Hamilton."
691,"Stacy, this is Mike Damone."
692,Hi.
693,Hi.
694,Nice to meet you.
695,See you later.
696,Right. Gotta be going.

700,I had a really nice time tonight.
701,"Me, too."

703,I never thought it would've happened at such a fancy place.
704,I know. You want to come in for a sec?
705,"Okay, sure."
706,Good.
707,Where's your brother?
708,He's out tonight with some friends.
709,Can I get you something to drink?
710,"No, that's okay."
711,"Oh. Well, would you mind if I change?"
712,No.
713,Okay. Could you get this for me?
714,It always sticks.
715,Thanks.
716,Where are your parents?
717,My parents are out of town for the weekend.

719,RATNER: This is a really nice picture of you.
720,STACY: Thanks.
721,You can come in my room if you want.
722,"So, what do you want to do?"
723,I don't know.
724,Um...
725,You want to look at a photo album?
726,I keep a lot of pictures from when I grew up and stuff.
727,"It's kind of stupid, huh?"
728,Sure. Yeah.
729,Yeah? Great.
730,Photographs.
731,This is the one that Brad took.
732,"It's like doubleimage type thing, you know."
733,It's like a mirror.
734,This is me being stupid.
735,"And this is my dog Gypsy, and my cat Tullio."
736,They're dead now.
737,Remember him?
738,Mr. Degan?
739,You had Degan?
740,He always wore the same suit!
741,The same suit!

743,He was terrible!
744,"No, I think it was one."
745,"So you go out there and you get one, too Love rules Yeah, love rules You know, I just thought of something."

758,Love rules Mark Ratner doesn't like me.
759,Mark Ratner doesn't like you?
760,You're crazy!
761,"No, he shows absolutely no interest in me."
762,Mark Ratner is definitely somebody you'd have to make the first move with.
763,"Linda, I did."
764,"I made the first move, I made the second move."
765,"I made a complete jerk out of myself, is what I did."
766,What do you care about Mark Ratner for?

768,You have dated older guys.
769,You work at the best food stand in the mall.

922,You know how cute I always thought you were.
923,"Stacy, do you have Qtips?"
924,I've got water in my ears.
925,I don't know. Check in the house.
926,Wait. Just a minute.
927,Doesn't anybody fucking knock anymore?
928,"In 1898, Spain owned Cuba outright."
929,Think about it.
930,"Cuba owned by a disorganized parliament 4,000 miles away."
931,Cubans were in a constant...
932,Cubans were in a constant state of revolt.
933,"In 1904, the United States decided to throw a little weight around..."
934,Who is it?
935,Mr. Pizza Guy.
936,Again?
937,"Mr. Pizza Guy, sir."
938,Who ordered the double cheese and sausage?
939,"Right here, dude."
940,"For you, dude."
941,Am I hallucinating?
942,What in the hell do you think you're doing?
943,Learning about Cuba and having some food.
944,"Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground."
945,You're causing a major disturbance on my time.
946,"I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand."
947,"If I'm here and you're here, doesn't that make it ""our"" time?"
948,"There's nothing wrong with a feast on ""our"" time."
949,"You're absolutely right, Mr. Spicoli."
950,It is our time.
951,"Yours, mine and everyone else's in this room."
952,But it is my class.
953,"Hamilton, Brandt, Cornfeld, up front!"
954,"Mr. Spicoli, has been kind enough to bring us a snack."
955,Be my guest.
956,Help yourselves.
957,Get a good one.
958,Mike?
959,Mike? Hi.
960,Hi.
961,How you doing?
962,Good.
963,How are you?
964,I hate walking.
965,I have to walk every day. It's such a drag.
966,Why don't you get a ride with somebody?
967,"Sometimes I ride with my brother, but he works mornings."
968,Then he drives himself to school.
969,What a guy.
970,"Listen, Mark Ratner really likes you."
971,Do you like him?
972,Mark is really nice.
973,But I think I like you.

982,Aren't you curious to see how your picture turned out?
983,I know what I look like.
984,I know.
985,But it's nice to have pictures of your friends and stuff.
986,I don't know. Maybe.
987,It's no big deal.
988,I probably will.
989,Must be nice having a pool.
990,You want to go swimming?
991,"Yeah, sure."
992,"I'm going to go change, okay?"
993,Yeah.
994,"Okay, great."

1019,"Linda, how long does Doug take?"
1020,Doug takes forever.
1021,Come on.
1022,He takes 20 to 30 minutes.
1023,I thought you said he took 30 to 40 minutes.
1024,That's right. I'm sorry.
1025,I meant 30 to 40 minutes.
1026,Why? How long did Damone take?
1027,Damone took 15 to 20 minutes.
1028,That's not bad for a high school boy.
1029,"Raised on the radio Yeah, I was raised on the radio Just like an allAmerican boy Mike! Hi!"
1030,Hi.
1031,"God, I haven't seen you for a while."
1032,Yeah.
1033,Kind of in a hurry.
1034,Got stuff I gotta do.
1035,"I'm in a hurry, too."
1036,I just thought I'd say hi to you.
1037,Hi.
1038,"Hamilton, I'll take over the fryer for a while."
1039,Those boys at IBM ordered a stack of those CatchoftheDay boxes.
1040,I told them you would personally deliver them within the hour.
1041,"Aye, aye, sir."
1042,"Hamilton, come over here."
1043,What are you doing?
1044,I'm changing.
1045,You took off your Captain Hook uniform.
1046,I thought I'd put my street clothes on for the drive to IBM.
1047,The uniform's uncomfortable.
1048,You're going there as a representative of Captain Hook Fish and Chips.
1049,"Part of our image, part of our appeal is that uniform."
1050,You know that.
1051,You want me to put the stuff back on?
1052,"Yes, I do."
1053,Show a little pride.
1054,"Aye, aye, sir."
1055,"Talk on the phone Call up the coast Call it collect Dial direct Reverse the charges If they accept they're home Or you can go overseas Speak Japanese Buy a new Sony They make great TVs Do the Watusi Watch I Love Lucy, too But don't let nobody Tell you that there's nothing to do Well, well, well, well Don't let nobody Tell you that there's nothing to do Dina, can you honestly tell me that you forgot?"
1056,Forgot the magnetism of Robin Zander or the charisma of Rick Nielsen?
1057,That's kid stuff.
1058,Kid stuff?
1059,How about the tunes?
1060,I want you to want me.
1061,The dream police Your mama's all right Your daddy's all right They just seem a little bit weird Mike? Mike?
1062,Can I talk to you for a sec?
1063,"Stacy, I'm doing business."
1064,"Call me tonight, all right?"
1065,No. I've gotta talk to you now. Okay?
1066,Don't go away.
1067,Look at them.
1068,I hope this is important because I could be blowing a big deal.
1069,"Mike, I just..."
1070,I just want you to know that I'm pregnant.
1071,How do you know it's mine?
1072,We only did it once.
1073,I haven't been with anybody else.
1074,I know it's yours.
1075,Jesus! It was your idea.
1076,You wanted to do it.
1077,You wanted it more than I did!
1078,No. Take that back.
1079,All right. I take it back.
1080,"Look, we gotta do something about it."
1081,I mean...
1082,We gotta get an abortion.
1083,My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
1084,It's simple.
1085,It's no big deal.
1086,Yeah. I got that planned.
1087,It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
1088,Doesn't sound free to me.
1089,I suppose you want me to pay for it.
1090,"Half, okay?"
1091,And a ride to the clinic.
1092,$75 and a ride.
1093,Okay.
1094,Okay. Thanks.
1095,Thank you.
1096,God.
1097,"DAMONE: Rick, I need that $50 you owe me."
1098,RICK: Don't have it.
1099,"I know times are tight, but I really need it."
1100,Don't have it now.
1101,"When you needed the tickets, I got them for you."
1102,So close to stage you probably scared the band.
1103,I'm not the Bank of America.
1104,"I know you're not the Bank of America, but I need my $50."
1105,How about Thursday?
1106,Thursday's too late. I need it tonight.
1107,Can't give you what I don't have.
1108,Just forget about it.
1109,"I'll get it from you Thursday, okay?"
1110,All right. See you.
1111,Flowers And the vine Take me Sleeping angel Catch me when you can Real love affairs Are heavy spells for a woman And a man Is Mike there?
1112,This is Stacy.
1113,"WOMAN: Hold on, please."
1114,"Stacy, he says he's helping his father in the garage."
1115,He'll call you later.
1116,Brad!
1117,Wait a second.
1118,"Yeah, this is it."
1119,We're just going bowling.
1120,Okay.
1121,Thanks a lot.
1122,See you later.
1123,Okay.
1124,How we doing in here?
1125,"Debbie, you ready to leave?"
1126,Yes. Thank you.
1127,"Stacy, I can't let you go unless you have a ride home."
1128,Oh. I told my boyfriend to meet me downstairs.
1129,Okay.
1130,Thanks.
1131,Brad.
1132,Since when do you go bowling anyway?
1133,"Okay, Brad."
1134,Please don't tell Mom and Dad.
1135,Come on! Who did it?
1136,"You're not gonna tell me, are you?"
1137,No.
1138,Okay. It'll just be your secret.
1139,Okay.
1140,You all right?
1141,Yeah.
1142,Come on.
1143,You hungry?
1144,Yeah.
1145,I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
1146,Why didn't you tell him?
1147,"Linda, he didn't show up."
1148,That little prick!
1149,I called his house.
1150,His mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
1151,"Mike Damone's a nobrain little prick, Stacy."
1152,I'm not gonna let him get away with this.
1153,"Linda, please don't do anything."
1154,I don't even like the guy.
1155,"Stacy, he's not a guy."
1156,He's a little prick!
1157,"I can't explain the way I feel Each time I get behind the wheel A rush of blood comes after power surges And my right foot urge is about to burst Hi, Mikey!"
1158,"Hi, Damone."
1159,"Damone, what went on between you and Stacy?"
1160,Let me tell you something.
1161,Sometimes girls go haywire.
1162,It happened a month ago.
1163,I've been trying to think of a way to tell you since.
1164,"We were out messing around, and something happened."
1165,It's over. It's no big deal.
1166,I never even called her again.
1167,"If you ask me, she's a very aggressive girl."
1168,Do you understand?
1169,"No, I don't understand."
1170,"She never really was your girlfriend, Rat."
1171,"Fuck you, Damone!"
1172,"There are a lot of girls out there, and you have to mess around with Stacy?"
1173,"What do you gotta prove, anyway?"
1174,I'm sorry.
1175,I always stick up for you.
1176,"Whenever people say, ""That Damone, he's a loudmouth,"" and they say that a lot, I always say, ""Hey, you just don't know Damone."" When they call you an idiot, I say, ""Damone's not an idiot."
1177,"You just don't know him."" You know, maybe they do know you pretty good."
1178,Maybe I'm just finding out now.
1179,Get lost.
1180,"You want to do something about it, Rat?"
1181,You want to do something about it?
1182,Come on.
1183,"Come on, you wuss!"
1184,"Okay. Let's go, man."
1185,I'll break your fucking head off.
1186,"Do something, man!"
1187,"A big talker, man!"
1188,Knock this crap off!
1189,Take it somewhere else.
1190,"Not in my gym, buddy."
1191,Shit.
1192,Woke up in a great mood.
1193,I don't know what the hell happened.
1194,Come on. Hurry up.
1195,Hurry up.
1196,Today we're going to explore how this hospital preserves human life.
1197,"We'll be visiting every floor, every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us in life and in death."
1198,Over 30 children are delivered here each day.
1199,WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Kramer to the nurses' station.
1200,"Good morning, Doctor."
1201,Hi.
1202,"Class, this is Dr. Miller."
1203,He'll be joining us for the last part of our tour today.
1204,"Hi. If you guys will follow me, please."
1205,I'd like to ask you one last time.
1206,Conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity.
1207,You in my class?
1208,I am today.
1209,"MR. VARGAS: Yes, Greg?"
1210,Who are these guys?
1211,Most of them are derelicts.
1212,They sold their bodies to medicine for money.
1213,"About $30, I think?"
1214,Twentyfive.
1215,Righteous bucks!
1216,This gentleman is named Arthur.
1217,MR. VARGAS: Arthur was good enough to die last week of heart failure.
1218,We are fortunate enough today to view his body in its pristine state.
1219,Here an incision has been made.
1220,"The ribs have been sawed off, allowing us to remove the breastplate and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state."
1221,Here we have the human lungs.
1222,"And here is the human heart which, you can see, is actually located in the center of your chest."
1223,Oh! Gnarly!
1224,Are you okay?
1225,Yeah. I'm fine.
1226,I just made a jerk out of myself.
1227,"No, you didn't."
1228,Can't go back in there.
1229,Sure.
1230,"We'll wait until they come out, and then we'll blend in."
1231,Here they come.
1232,You're so nice.
1233,"I don't know I don't know which way I should go I don't know I don't know, I don't know if I'm high or I'm low I don't know I don't know, I don't know if I'm high or I'm low I don't know You should be coming on pretty soon, dude."
1234,How much did you smoke?
1235,This'll be a little demonstration of that.
1236,Listen up.
1237,What was that?
1238,That was my skull.
1239,I'm so wasted!
1240,"Oh, man! What is this stuff?"
1241,Doesn't that stuff cause brain damage?
1242,Only if you take it every day for a month.
1243,Bitching!
1244,"Dude, I'll pick you up in the van and go to the dance."
1245,Later.
1246,"Jeff, you have company."
1247,"Get out of here, Curtis."
1248,I don't hear you unless you knock.
1249,That's better. Entrez.
1250,Mr. Hand!
1251,"Well, were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?"
1252,Yeah.
1253,The graduation dance.
1254,It's the last school fiesta of the year.
1255,I'm afraid we've got some business to discuss here.
1256,"Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?"
1257,"According to my calculations, Mr. Spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year."
1258,"And rest assured, that is a kind estimate."
1259,Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account.
1260,"Tonight you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular."
1261,If you can turn to page 47 of Land of Truth and Liberty.
1262,"Oh, I left that book in my locker, Mr. Hand."
1263,"In that case, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you."
1264,"He was a hardheaded man He was brutally handsome And she was terminally pretty She held him up and he held her for ransom ln the heart of the cold, cold city DAMONE: Look, Mark."
1265,I want to apologize for everything that's happened.
1266,I'm really sorry.
1267,A guy just doesn't do that to a buddy.
1268,I understand. You can't help it.
1269,"You're just lewd, crude and obnoxious."
1270,I can deal with that.
1271,Excuse me.
1272,"Listen, are we still friends?"
1273,Huh?
1274,Okay.
1275,All right.
1276,"SPICOLI: What Jefferson was saying was, ""Hey!"
1277,"""We left this England place 'cause it was bogus."
1278,"""So if we don't get some cool rules ourselves, pronto, ""we'll just be bogus, too."" Very close, Jeff."
1279,I think I've made my point with you tonight.
1280,"Mr. Hand, do you have a guy like me in class every year?"
1281,"You know, a guy who you make an example of?"
1282,You'll find out next year.
1283,No way!
1284,"As soon as I cruise history, I'm not coming near your side of the building."
1285,Cruise history?
1286,Soon as I pass your class.
1287,If you pass.
1288,You're gonna flunk me?
1289,"Don't worry, Spicoli."
1290,You'll probably squeak by.
1291,Yeah!
1292,"Aloha, Mr. Hand."
1293,"Aloha, Spicoli."
1294,"Honey, these are my two star students."
1295,"Boys, I'd like you to meet my wife, Mrs. Vargas."
1296,Hi.
1297,SPICOLI: Summer! Yeah!
1298,Totally!
1299,LINDA: I wrote him a letter.
1300,Tell me what you think.
1301,"""Dear Doug."
1302,"""I received your message that you weren't coming to my graduation."
1303,"""Doug, this is not the kind of thing that occurs between adults."
1304,"""Maybe you've found someone new, someone more mature."
1305,"""But if you ask me, Doug, you're the one being childish."
1306,"""Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna sit around and wait for you, forget it."
1307,"""Sincerely, Linda."" What do you think?"
1308,Uh...
1309,I have another version where I call him an asshole.
1310,"No, that one's better. It's more..."
1311,Mature?
1312,Yeah.
1313,I don't have to sink to his level.
1314,Yeah.
1315,"I can go out with anyone I want, practically."
1316,That's right.
1317,Yeah. Thanks for cheering me up.
1318,Come on.
1319,"Hey, dude!"
1320,I know that song.
1321,"Hey, I'm not."
1322,I'm not!
1323,"Mattie told Hattie About the things you do Hey, come on down from there."
1324,"To wooly bully you Wooly bully Wooly bully Wooly bully Wooly bully Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully Wooly bully, wooly bully Wooly bully STACY: Linda, I finally figured it out."
1325,I don't want sex.
1326,Anyone can have sex.
1327,What do you want?
1328,I want a relationship.
1329,I want romance.
1330,You want romance?
1331,"In Ridgemont? We can't even get cable TV here, and you want romance."
1332,Another summer at Perry's.
1333,I can't. I swear.
1334,It's not that bad.
1335,Keep your eyes open.
1336,There's lots of men around here.
1337,"As we strolled by the sea Together Under stars twinkling high above So in love are we two No one else but me and you So in love Two so in love So much in love Two so in love So in love Two so in love Are you and I Two, you and I So in love Hi."
1338,Hi.
1339,How you doing?
1340,Fine.
1341,I'm glad you came over 'cause I have this picture of me that I wanted to give to you so that you'll remember to call me over the summer.
1342,I don't know.
1343,I'm going to be traveling a lot this summer and I'm not sure...
1344,I'll give you a call sometime.
1345,That'd be great.
1346,LINDA: Stacy!
1347,You worked at All American Burger.
1348,Seven months ago.
1349,I knew it.
1350,"Why don't you get a job, Spicoli?"
1351,What for?
1352,You need money.
1353,"All I need are some tasty waves, cool buzz and I'm fine."
1354,Thanks.
1355,Can I use your bathroom?
1356,"Yeah, go ahead."
1357,It's the first door on the left.
1358,Like up this ramp?
1359,First door on the left.
1360,"Money, and I want it now. Now!"
1361,Okay. Okay.
1362,Now!
1363,What are you doing?
1364,The safe!
1365,Behind the donuts!
1366,I've been watching this place.
1367,I know what I'm doing.
1368,Open it up. Open it up!
1369,Okay.
1370,Come on! Come on!
1371,I just started here.
