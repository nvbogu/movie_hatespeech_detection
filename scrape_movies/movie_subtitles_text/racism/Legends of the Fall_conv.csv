0,"inner voices with great clearness and they live by what they hear Such people become crazy or they become legend Tristan Ludlow was born in the Moon of the Falling Leaves It was a terrible winter His mother almost died bringing him into this world His father, the Colonel, brought him to me I wrapped him in a bearskin and held him all that night As he grew into a man I taught him the great joy of the kill when the hunter cuts out its warm heart and holds it in his hands setting its spirit free Colonel Ludlow had three sons but Tristan was his favorite I had had sons too But they were gone now forever It was a very bad time The Colonel had tried to help the People The Colonel had tried to help the People but it was no use So he decided to go his own way He wanted to lose the madness over the mountains, he said and begin again ""Lose the madness, '""he said And so we lived for many years and the boys grew strong Alfred was the older brother old even for his years Samuel was the youngest There was nothing these brothers would not do for him They watched over him like a treasure One year..."
1,"I am an old man and cannot remember the year But it was the Moon of the Red Grass when Isabel Ludlow, their mother went away for the winter She said the winters were too cruel for her She said she was afraid of the bears She was a strange woman anyway That spring, though, she did not return And, after that, she did not come much to see us Alfred wrote her many letters but Tristan refused to speak of her His world was here with me Every warrior hopes a good death will find him but Tristan couldn't wait He went looking for his Tristan!"
2,Here  Was it a bear?
3," Yes, sir  Was it a bear?"
4," Yes, sir  Can you breathe?"
5," Yes Take your hand away Take it away You're a stupid, halfbrained jackass  Yes, sir  One Stab put you up to this?"
6,"You deserve to be dead God knows how you've lived so long It'll be all right, son I have these letters many letters Read them They are from all of them Ludlow Isabel Samuel the whole family the whole story It is all written here April 13, 1913 Dear Isabel: I am not fool enough to try to reorder a life already lived but I fear I have not done well raising our sons alone in this wild place What did I know of children?"
7,"I was trained to lead men This is infinitely harder Dear William: You take too much responsibility on yourself, as always Our sons are finding their own paths They are willful, certainly, but then who are you and I to complain of willfulness?"
8,"As for Samuel, I have big news At a Harvard tea for Amy Lowell he met and instantly loved Miss Susannah Finncannon I know it will surprise you greatly but they are engaged He will bring her to Montana this summer to meet his brothers and you So, William, please behave yourself and be as charming as only you can be There he is  How the hell are you?"
9, Good And you?
10," Samuel Good to see you, boy  Father, how are you?"
11," Good to see you  Hello This is my fianc√©e, Susannah  Hello  Miss Finncannon  Nice to meet you  It's an honor  This is Alfred  How do you do?"
12," Here's your dog, miss  Thank you  It's a horse  That's a strangelooking animal This is Finn He's a champion You like exoticlooking dogs then, Miss Finncannon?"
13,"Very much, Mr. Ludlow  Please call me Susannah  All right  He's just plain old Alfred  Shut up  Where's Tristan?"
14," He's off somewhere You know him He'll welcome you home tonight or I'll know the reason why Miss Finncannon, please Did you have a good journey?"
15,"She is such a lovely creature But I fear the loss of her parents has given her a certain fragility I think she feels very alone in the world But she has found a new family now, hasn't she?"
16,The German military is ready to use chaos in Croatia as a justification for actions that could plunge the entire civilized world into...
17,"The word ""civilized"" has no place in discussing the affairs of this world Mother told us of your sympathy for the social reformers You make it sound like a disease No, I'm in agreement You mother told me all about One Stab She says he was a great warrior Yes He has a bag of scalps to prove it But don't worry He's devoted to Father now Rather, they're devoted to each other Can he speak English?"
18,"Stab, speak English?"
19,He wouldn't lower himself to speak English But watch out because he understands it perfectly well There's Tristan  Don't they feed you?
20," Not much  You smell  Miss me, did you?"
21, Still hung over?
22, Still drunk Isn't she amazing?
23,So this is Tristan And does he speak English?
24,"For God's sake Miss Finncannon, it's a pleasure to meet you I hope you and Ugly here find every happiness together Don't mind my brother Your dog has more breeding than he has This is Mother's room It's lovely  It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet  And you, miss Thank you  Which one?"
25, It's this one Angelica Susannah Hello You must be Isabel Two I've already met your mother and father  How old are you?
26," Thirteen When I was 13, I was sent away to boarding school I hated it May I help you?"
27,"You're going to marry Samuel That's right, I am I'm going to marry Tristan We'll be sisters I see you two have met Isabel Two is letting me help Would you like a rest?"
28,"You must be exhausted No, not at all This is so refreshing all this grandeur, this unexpected gift from God It doesn't seem like much of a gift in a hard winter, I assure you Where's Samuel?"
29,"Inside I could tell your father wanted him all to himself  You're very generous  No, just happy Stop mooning over her and come in here Samuel wants to know about those calves from Cheyenne Get in here Please excuse my father It makes him feel young and powerful to treat us like we're idiot children For all His countless blessings, may God's holy name be praised Amen Tell Father what you were saying about Vienna  What's that?"
30," It's the Kaiser He won't stop them from annihilating Serbia Let's not talk about war, please Susannah hears that England's mobilizing We're stuck out here while all this is going on  Thank God  You wouldn't want us to evade a duty  Wouldn't I?"
31," Father, with respect..."
32,"Please excuse me for being late I packed so carefully, I couldn't find anything Thank you Would you like some..."
33,"As evening fell a maiden stood At the edge of a wood In her hands lay the reins Of a stallion And n'er I'd seen A girl as fair Heard a gentler voice anywhere Whispered, alas She belonged Belonged to another Another, forever Yes, she belonged to The twilight and mist Dear Isabel: How strange to have a cultivated woman in the house again and how intoxicating To have all three of my sons under my roof again fills me with such a deep, quiet satisfaction that I thank God There's a friend of yours A dollar says he brings her back Whoa Easy You got it Nice work You guys look like ice cream cones I know you would have Ready Here we go Go easy on him, Susannah Alfred, you take over I must talk to Tristan You've disgraced the Colonel's name  Nice shiner  I hit her back She's got me spinning She's got me spinning I'll bet She's got these ideas and theories, and she's so..."
34,What?
35,Nothing How'd you break the mare?
36,She's what?
37,She's sort of passionate  She a virgin?
38," Good Lord, Tristan  You brought it up  Of course she is Are you?"
39," Yes, I am  Going to wait till you're married?"
40,"See, she says..."
41,Susannah thinks that...
42,We're not gonna wait And you're afraid you won't meet her expectations?
43,I guess I am Sort of I don't know Should I be?
44,"Samuel, God bless you You are good at everything you try I'm sure it will be the same with fucking Tristan, really  She's my future wife  You're not going to fuck her?"
45,I'm planning to be with her I recommend fucking  You're impossible  You brought it up My point!
46,"Good morning, Colonel Ludlow Tristan's hunting He didn't do it You don't have to worry about Tristan Meet John T and James O'Banion They own the mercantile store  Morning, James, John T, Sheriff  Morning, Alfred We're looking for a man we heard might be in this part of the country Name is Tom Cullen Here's a likeness What did this fella do?"
47,Do you recognize him?
48," Yeah, I recognize him  We got him This fellow passed by here maybe four or five years ago Did some work here on his way to San Francisco He was hoping to book passage to Australia Or Hong Kong I can't remember  Can you remember?"
49, Hong Kong  What is he wanted for?
50, He...
51,"That would be of a private nature ""Private nature""?"
52,"It's a public office you hold, Sheriff Gentlemen ""There came a low hiss, a horrid sound that made Rikki Tikki Tavi jump back two clear feet And then out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag the big black cobra"" I can read another story The Germans broke through at Armentieres The British are trapped in the Belgian lowlands  This paper is a week old!"
53," Calm down With my fluent German, I could become an officer And lead other boys to the slaughter and be slaughtered yourself The men who served under you worshipped you They were all damn fools This is a turning point in history  How can we..."
54, What?
55,You can't expect us not to be part of this  You taught us...
56," To think for yourselves  And to defend what's ours  Yes, what is ours!"
57,We've already lost two cousins Who we've never met! Don't talk at me as though I've never seen a war!
58,Not a war like this They said that about the War of Secession and the Indian wars They say it to sell newspapers These are not the Indian wars We're fighting against naked aggression!
59,There will be no more talk of wars in this house! Damn it!
60,"I'm sorry, Susannah I'm going to Canada to enlist I'm going with him I'm sorry, my love I meant to speak to you tonight I know you'll understand It's the only honorable thing to do What's that?"
61,It's a book my father wrote to try to convince the government to alter their policies towards the Indians in the Dakotas Samuel won't change his mind Change it for him What happened between them?
62,"Father says she never liked it here I think they loved mostly the idea of each other Don't let him go I'll take care of him October 14, 1914 My dear Isabel: Today our sons are leaving home to defend an England they have never seen I am unable to stop them I have tried to shelter our sons from all the madness and now they go to seek it Be careful You don't have to go Goodbye Don't worry, Father Take care I'll bring you the Kaiser's helmet Bring yourself back That would please me more Yes, sir  Take care of Samuel  I will Colonel Ludlow told me: ""Ride with them to Calgary Bring back the horses '"" ""Damn fools, '""he called them The Colonel would not have his sons ride off to war on old nags damn fools or not Let's join them Bring your plate He'll be back May we join you?"
63,"Sit down Feeling lonely in there Sit here What's her name, Two?"
64,"Lady Tristan's Lady In the story, Tristan's lady was Isolde  Do you know who Isolde was?"
65," No Your daughter needs an education She can read and write, Colonel School might be awkward for her  I'll teach her myself  May I help?"
66,"Yeah I'll teach her history and mathematics With your permission, Decker, and yours, Pet What do you think?"
67,What will she do with all this education?
68,"She'll live a richer, fuller life, of course She's a halfbreed Not in this house  Tristan calls me a halfbreed  Tristan calls you a halfbreed?"
69,"He says I'm half gopher and half hawk  After her chores  Yeah  To us all  To you, sir  And miss  And to the boys And the boys Get back to your unit Those boys are boring I'd rather have you watching my back Now, mate February 3, 1915 Dear Susannah: The horror of this place is indescribable Nothing is as I thought it would be Keep your distance!"
70,Keep your spacing!
71,"Tonight, as I prayed for the souls of those who've died so terribly yet so bravely I admit that I also prayed for personal glory Is that wrong to want to distinguish myself gloriously in combat as my father did?"
72,Tristan and Alfred watch over me so carefully I may never get the opportunity Charge!
73,Alfred! Are you all right?
74,Goddamn it!
75, Are you hit?
76," It's just a scratch Susannah, I see now not that my father was right, but that I was naive  Let me up, damn it!"
77, Stay down!
78,Fall back!
79,"Still, we place our bodies in God's keeping We go into battle honorably full of confidence with His name on our lips  We're pinned here  We'll wait  Give him a hand  Help him down Goddamn Susannah: I try to guard against despair but there are moments when it seems that all human decency is broken down Alfred will recover from his wounds but he and Tristan seem to have drifted apart, or worse I cannot understand it I miss you more than you can imagine You are all that is clean and cool and pure I close my eyes and fix my thoughts on you I now regret that we listened to everyone and agreed to wait to marry Even more, I regret that I left before we could be together as we planned, my beloved Please stay on at the ranch and wait for me Don't let Father worry I know God's mercy will protect me aided considerably by Tristan who seems to be in France less to fight the Germans than to act as a nursemaid to me Be well, my love Your own, Samuel Captain needs me to translate this before tonight's reconnaissance  Alfred will want to see you  I'll be there  Yeah?"
80, Go on Where's Samuel?
81,"He's translating He'll be here Boy, that's a good one  Vino?"
82, Put that away  They said you'll get a medal  Yes  They're sending me home  I'm glad for you I'm an officer I belong with my men Horseshit What's left of them MacKenzie was just brought in His leg's turned bad  He said...
83, What?
84, He said...
85, What?
86,What is it?
87,He said your brother volunteered to take his place on the reconnaissance with the Capitan Goddamn it!
88,I told you to stay with him!
89, I'm here!
90, Where? I can't see I can't move!
91,I'm coming!
92,"I got you now I got you You're doing good We're going home God, no!"
93,"Goddamn you, God!"
94,"Tristan, it's me March 20, 1915 Dear Father and Susannah: I am being discharged from the Army, but I cannot come home yet I will write to Grandfather Ludlow in Cornwall and ask him to let me join him and go to sea As for our beloved Samuel all I can send home is his heart Alfred will bring it back He should be buried up in the box canyon where he used to draw the birds Your son, Tristan He certainly was the best of all of us, wasn't he?"
95,"He certainly was the best of all of us, wasn't he?"
96,Good night What you saw before Samuel left...
97,"Please, don't..."
98,"No, I want to It is Samuel I loved All right Tristan will be back someday Your father will be pleased Susannah was to return to Boston on the morning train but a norther blew for three days and drifted over the tracks The Colonel insisted she stay on until spring The house was too empty, he said This was still her home, he told her He should have let her go But how could he have known what would happen?"
99,She was not to blame She was like the water that freezes in the rock and splits it apart It was no more her fault than it is the fault of the water when the rock shatters You know how much l...
100,You know how much I loved Samuel And I think you know...
101,"Out of respect for him, I wanted to say it in this place I think you know that I'm in love with you From the first moment I saw you like in a novel That's my mother's overblown romantic imagination coming out in me You're not making this very easy for me Sorry Is there any hope that you could learn to love me?"
102,"Not the way you love Samuel, of course but enough to..."
103,"We could make a life together A happy life I don't think so Sounds like you're not sure, though Maybe there's a chance?"
104, What?
105," I can only cause you pain, Alfred Why don't you let me be the judge of that?"
106,"I didn't break it, but I can fix it I can put the damn wheel back on and take it off myself Go take a nap  What?"
107, Look!
108,I'm going into town if...
109,"Welcome home, son I couldn't save him Of course you couldn't It's all right Have a nice ride today?"
110,"Excuse me, Father Tristan, please When are you planning to be married?"
111,Good morning Damn you You will marry her  Make an honest woman of her?
112, Yes!
113,"God damn you to hell Yes, I will marry her, if she'll have me If she'll have you?"
114,Do you love her?
115,Or did you seduce her just to spite me?
116,That's not what I did  What about Samuel?
117, What?
118,You tell me about Samuel We all loved Samuel Samuel is dead What?
119,"How convenient for you Because you love her, I will forgive you for that Once You say that again, and we're not brothers Once!"
120,"You know you can't make her happy I'm gonna try You will fail I'll be leaving today I wish you both all the best  Goodbye, son  Wish me luck Good luck September 7, 1915 Dearest Mother: I think I may have found my place in this world Helena is a city turned modern overnight bursting with all the energy and vitality of our times I feel alive here There is much opportunity for anyone willing to dedicate himself to his labors Already, I have acquired a reputation for honesty and fair dealing and I am pleased to call some of Helena's most influential citizens my friends They are determined to see this city grow, as am I We're proud of you Mother, thank you for your kind letter You knew my hopes That you understand my disappointment is a great comfort to me Every night I pray for the grace to forgive Tristan I know you understand Your loving son, Alfred Quit it!"
121,Quit it!
122,Goddamn it!
123,"If we have a boy, I'd like to call him Samuel And if it's a girl, Isabel I'll still love you You'll tolerate me because of how much I love you Nothing I heard from your mother She says Alfred has hooked up with those damn O'Banion brothers  He's doing well  Alfred's gonna do well wherever he is  Except here with us  That's my fault  I didn't say that  Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?"
124,Don't you dare say that That was in God's hands Was it?
125,Colonel! Lost a couple calves near Camas Canyon  Might be a grizzly  My grizzly?
126," You take him, Tristan  Damn right I will I don't know why Tristan did not kill that damn old bear The Old Ones say: ""When a man and an animal have spilled each other's blood they become one '"" I said four beers, Mr. Sachtleben I said four beers, Mr. Sachtleben And I said no Indians  He's quite civilized, I assure you  Yeah?"
127, Give him a beer  Stay out of it  My father said four  He heard me We're about to reach an understanding Just give him a goddamn beer!
128,Stay out of it!
129,"Damn you You're a damn fool You're spoiling for a fight with a man who outweighs you As we speak, he's searching for some kind of a weapon Isn't that right?"
130,To split your stupid skull and kill you and good riddance Leave it!
131," Yes, sir?"
132," I want four beers, now The lousy owner says he doesn't want to serve Indians Get back Do you see this man?"
133,Do you?
134,"His name is One Stab He's a venerated elder of the Cree and has counted coup on hundreds of his enemies He is our friend He's thirsty I think it was the bear's voice he heard deep inside him growling low of dark, secret places Were you going to say goodbye?"
135,How long will you be gone?
136,"Not long A few months I can make it better for you If we'd had a child or if I were pregnant, would you still go?"
137,"Yes Just give me a chance Don't do that Look at me Please, look at me I'll wait for you However long it takes I'll wait for you forever Will he come back?"
138,"I don't know I don't know Stab says yes April 20, 1918 Dear Tristan: It has been months now, and still no word The only sign that you are alive is a tattered parcel that arrived today from New Guinea covered with strange writing and containing what appears to be a native bracelet Meant for me, I presume But perhaps not Do you still care to know what is happening here?"
139,Cattle prices continue to fall and winter seems never ending Why don't you write?
140,Are you never coming back and afraid to tell me?
141,"Alfred continues to do well His business has expanded to include financial concerns in Chicago and Washington I don't pretend to understand He wants us to send Isabel Two to boarding school in Chicago but she adamantly refuses to leave the ranch I think she, too, is waiting for you I have nowhere to send this letter and no reason to believe you wish to receive it I write it only for myself I will hide it away with all the things left unsaid and undone between us December 12, 1919 Dear Susannah: I have become a hunter Tell Stab there are creatures here that cannot even be found in books I have killed them all All we had is dead As I am dead Marry another Colonel, it looks like we've got company  I have come to ask for your blessing  My blessing?"
142,"You see, these gentlemen and..."
143,"And a great many others, I might add They're urging me to run for office  What office?"
144, The United States Congress That's how highly we think of your son And what do you gentlemen hope to get out of this?
145,I beg your pardon?
146,"I've spoken plain English, sir What do you want for yourselves?"
147,"Father, I don't think that these gentlemen..."
148,Didn't you ask that question or do you believe these gentlemen back you out of patriotic duty and your inestimable worth?
149,"You forget yourself, Father I am no longer a child Colonel, the Congress..."
150,"Congress is government, sir I worked for the government once The issues that we..."
151,"Indians! Indians were the issue in those days There is nothing so grotesque as the meeting of a child with a bullet or an entire village slaughtered while sleeping That was the government's resolution of that particular issue I've seen nothing since then to persuade me it's gained in wisdom, common sense or humanity Gentlemen, my father, for whom I have the deepest respect says that the government has neither wisdom nor humanity I will then consider it my absolute duty as my father's son to bring both wisdom and humanity to the United States Congress I thank you for your blessing Gentlemen  Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars  Yes Certainly Are you all right?"
152,What's wrong?
153,I don't know what to say Tristan's always been wild  You love him for that  Do I?
154,"I suppose I do He does love you She's to be your brother's wife Yes, though you better remind him of that fact He's not here to defend himself No, but I see you are here to defend him and what is his even though he's abandoned her and you I won't even speak of who else he abandoned Damn you, boy Don't you blame my son for Samuel's death!"
155,"Samuel chose to be a soldier, and soldiers die sent to their slaughter by men in government Parasites like you!"
156,Damn and blast you!
157,Damn you And damn you too!
158,Shut your mouth Leave her out of this!
159,Get out of my house and get off my land Why? Because I want to serve my country as you did?
160,"Or because, like you, I love a woman who doesn't love me?"
161,"He used her and deserted her, your darling Tristan Alfred, don't Please I loved her!"
162,"I love her still He stole her from me If you want to know the truth he stole her from Samuel before the war God help me, I'll kill you Here Read your darling Tristan's letter You deserve to be happy Late that night we found the Colonel on the floor beside a cold fire He could not move His hair turned white overnight and he became an old man And after that, Tristan sent no more letters As the years passed by we would hear that someone had seen him on a ship going up some river no white man had gone up before Stories came to us Strange stories And then, for years, there was nothing He was lost to us That was all we knew But every year, in the Moon of the Falling Leaves But every year, in the Moon of the Falling Leaves I would dream that the bear's voice inside him had grown silent and that Tristan might again come to live in the world But then the winter would come And then another spring And still he stayed away What the hell is he doing?"
163,"She's a mean old bitch, but she's yours Welcome home Old man!"
164,Where's Father?
165,"He had a stroke some years ago He can't talk now Oh, Father He wants to celebrate I'm happy too Father, this is for you ""Colonel William Ludlow, from his son Tristan"" I didn't know These are boars' tusks, made by a Javanese warrior He, too, was a great man I have other things for Mother and Little Izzy and Susannah What is it?"
166,"Alfred and Miss Susannah were married several years ago Your brother's a congressman now They have a big, new place in Helena It's as it should be Cattle prices dropped after the war ended The Colonel ain't seem to care He lost just about everything he had We'll make it back on horses or something else if we have to We'll make it back He's saying that your brother voted for the Volstead Act Did he? You suggesting I become a bootlegger?"
167,"Good money in bootlegging, if you know what you're doing Screw the government Screw them Screw them!"
168,Screw the government Forever turned out to be too long I know Here I don't want it They told me that this was magic that whoever wore it would be protected Keep it Don't you want to see Alfred?
169,It's probably better that I don't Tell him hello and congratulations He likes you Welcome home Isabel?
170,I want you to have him I want you to have him I have something for you too I brought it back It's from lerapetra  That's in...
171," Crete  Yeah  I know where it is Your father taught me European history A little girl That's me, right?"
172,"Thank you Okay, we'll see you in a few days Don't wait on me I'll be fine It was then that Tristan came into the quiet heart of his life The bear inside him was sleeping It is hard to tell of happiness Time goes by and we feel safe too soon  I heard the oddest news  Yes?"
173, I heard the oddest news  Yes?
174,"Yes Tristan is back Yes, I know You know?"
175,How do you know?
176,I saw him He had the audacity to come here just to see you?
177,"He wanted to see you, but thought you'd get upset He might be right What did he..."
178,What did he say?
179,He said to say hello and congratulations Silly me He told you the news?
180,What do you think?
181,"Come on It's perfectly absurd Marrying Isabel Two God, she's practically our sister She can't be more than, what, 19?"
182,Twenty I can't imagine what the hell Decker is thinking of to allow this Perhaps he's thinking of his daughter's happiness Happiness?
183,With Tristan?
184,"You, of all people, should know how impossible that is I'm not Isabel Two June 2, 1921 Dear Tristan: I was so pleased to hear of your coming marriage Your father must be very happy Isabel Two is like a daughter to him as she was named after your own mother It seems as though it was always meant to be, doesn't it?"
185,"Damnation Samuel Decker Ludlow Dearest Tristan: Alfred and I were delighted to hear of your son's birth We hoped for a child of our own, but of that I despair I know Alfred thinks of you often I look forward to the day when we all might see one another again Your son bears a proud and noble name I know he will live up to it Please give my love to Isabel Two and to your father and everyone else Yours always, Susannah Evening, gentlemen Been meaning to talk to you about one or two things By all means As you know perfectly well we handle the liquor around here Now, you've been a smalltime operator An amateur, frankly Lately, your shipments have been getting a little fat and my patience has been getting a little thin So the next time you get in our way will be the last time Excuse me I appreciate it Perhaps you're wondering why you're not dead already Because your brother is Congressman Ludlow And that's it That's all Kenneth Thomas Can't you just say hello?"
186," Hello, Alfred  Hello, Tristan  Who's this young man?"
187, This is Samuel She's beautiful Let me see  Who is this lady?
188, I'm your Aunt Susannah I used to know your Uncle Samuel who died in the war  You look like him  That's what Grandpa says He was very brave and very good Grandpa says that too Grandpa says I can have Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger Would you come and see it?
189,I'd love to Sometime  He's a fine boy  He is  How is Father? Well?
190, As well as can be expected  I wish...
191, Pardon the intrusion Excuse me We're ready for your speech now I'll be there in a minute Thank you  We'll meet again soon?
192," I'd like that Watch this Go and get Tynert I think you missed a bump, Stab Jesus!"
193,"Sir, we have information that you're transporting goods in violation of the Volstead Act If you mean a case of Irish whiskey for my father, I am Give it up He'll be disappointed Hold him down Let's get out of here  There's an envelope in his pocket  Now My brother told you to stay out of our way Put him in the car  I don't want to see him  Father..."
194,"I don't want to see him I'm so very sorry Father won't see me, even now?"
195,He blames the government for Isabel's...
196,"There's something we have to talk about The officer you beat almost died Now, everyone understands but you'll have to plead guilty serve 30 days And the one who shot his gun?"
197,He was reprimanded  The O'Banions?
198," Nothing You have to let it go It was a terrible, tragic accident Listen to me You let this go now You got in over your head I'll need a minute I'm so sorry We all loved her How are you?"
