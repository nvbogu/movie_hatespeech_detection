0,The thing that's thrown in this dump on the Chinese border...
1,is me.
2,"My name is AglaÃ©, and it's not that surprising I ended up here."
3,That's me three months ago.
4,"I had a quiet, simple, wellorganized life."
5,"It didn't look like it, but I was as happy as a hamster in a wheel."
6,I caught a cold that weekend finishing a cricket game.
7,"Yes, I played cricket, a game with 88 pages of rules and annexes, it was perfect for me."
8,Are we eating Thai?
9, I'm going home.
10," Me, too."
11,But we always eat Thai after the game!
12,"It's true, it was hard to change my mind."
13,But being alone wasn't a problem.
14,On the contrary...
15,How did the planets align that day to make everything go to hell?
16,Where were you?
17,I was sick all night long.
18,I couldn't sleep.
19,I took a pill that knocked me out.
20,My eyes were too blurry to read the notice.
21,How do you read tiny print if one of the symptoms is blurred vision?
22,"They make singing birthday cards, why not talking pillboxes?"
23,You don't know?
24,Know what?
25,"""Dispossessed of her ovaries"" in 9 letters."
26,Seems like you don't give a shit.
27,I'm doing what I can.
28,"Some people cry, I do crosswords."
29,I'll stop if makes you happy.
30,What don't I know?
31,We were all called to the courtyard this morning.
32,Longchamp and all the department heads explained the factory wasn't profitable and...
33,it was being moved abroad.
34,We've got a ton of work.
35,"Test room's being painted, training's in a month."
36,They didn't say when it would close.
37,But we're all being fired.
38,They can't do that!
39,Castrated! Found it.
40,"Castrated, but for a woman."
41,"If it's written, then it must be possible."
42,These games are pretty sneaky.
43,"Marcelle did crosswords, I relaxed by checking."
44,And rechecking.
45,"Two, three, four, five times..."
46,I've hated the unexpected ever since I was a kid.
47,Mostly because of my mother.
48,Lola was the only firebreathing stripper in Europe.
49,She was only mildly talented at both.
50,But was gifted at performing in dumps.
51,Mommy?
52,"Last time, I promise!"
53,That's about when I stopped believing the crap she told me.
54,What's this?
55,It's for work.
56,I realized I had to do things myself.
57,I'd always wanted to escape that life.
58,"I paid for the room, I decide what we do in it!"
59,Never underestimate yourself.
60,"As soon as I was old enough, I left and went to work."
61,And if I asked for 3 copies?
62,You entered 333 copies 3 times.
63,I eventually got a job adapted to my abilities.
64,The frontal lobe is down.
65,The crash lab was the only place where I felt that I fit in.
66,"The frontal lobe is down, reactivate the verification protocol!"
67,I need replacement cables and 3 trackers.
68,I loved my job.
69,"I caused accidents, crash tests."
70, She's totally insane.
71, Yes. She's the best tech we ever had.
72,"Acceleration in 10, Procedure is stopped."
73,The management wants all activity stopped.
74,That's a bit rude.
75,I missed lunch.
76,I don't know how you can do this job all year long.
77,You get good at distancing yourself.
78,The labor agreement legally requires us to offer you an equivalent job in the new factory.
79,We offer it knowing you'll refuse to be relocated to India.
80, It's really in India?
81, Unfortunately.
82, What city?
83," I don't know, it's unpronounceable."
84,The goal of this first meeting is to find viable solutions for the future.
85,"Let me reassure you, we have an excellent retraining program that will enable you to take on new challenges."
86,I don't want new challenges.
87,You read the work conditions?
88,You'd been turning pages 5 minutes...
89,So...
90,Here's your salary reevaluated to the Indian market.
91, That's not possible.
92, Yes.
93,Neither stocks nor health insurance and you work 48 hours per week.
94,Same position?
95,"Yes, probably."
96,Yes or probably?
97,"Its equivalent, in the new crash department."
98,We've many more meetings...
99,I'll keep my job.
100,You want to relocate to India?
101,Yes.
102,Don't you want to think about it?
103,No.
104,Is India nice?
105,"Dunno, my grandparents are Sri Lankan."
106,I'm probably moving there.
107, What'll you do there?
108, There are women's cricket leagues.
109,I'm making no progress here.
110,You're moving to India for cricket?
111,Among other things.
112,"I was fed up, it wasn't like me to stall when I made a decision."
113,Things were bad at the factory.
114,AglaÃ©!
115,Where are you going?
116,To sign my contract.
117,You can't do that!
118,I've made my decision.
119,This one?
120,"No, that's the refusal."
121,"I didn't sign, it annoyed them."
122, I have a meeting.
123, Can I go with you?
124,"Not you, too?"
125,I won't suffocate here another 6 months.
126,"OK, I'm going."
127, What solidarity!
128, Does it look like I'm into solidarity?
129,That was Marcelle.
130,That stubborn old girl had been awaiting retirement since age 24.
131,Her job let her buy quality cleaning products and give herself allinclusive group vacations in warm countries.
132,"So, why not India?"
133,"Marcelle never would have gone alone, but with me, it was practically a group trip."
134,How can you make an offer like this?
135,It was made to be refused.
136, Is it negotiable?
137, We can offer less.
138, You're a prick.
139, Why are you here anyway?
140, It doesn't concern you.
141, Colleagues concern me.
142,Gentlemen...
143,Ladies...
144,Yes?
145,Why are you here?
146,They're signing their contracts.
147,She's going to work in our new Indian complex.
148,What's this bullshit?
149,What do you want?
150,We're in a meeting.
151,You're being held in this room indefinitely.
152,You've got nothing better?
153,When you reconsider offshoring.
154,Can you play cowboys after we're done?
155,Why's she annoying me?
156,"You represent them, you know."
157,I can't negotiate work conditions in India.
158,They're supporting offshoring by signing.
159,"No, just keeping my job."
160,Entire families work here!
161,Can they move to India?
162,"It may amuse you, but people have obligations here."
163,Unbelievable.
164,You're talking about family obligations?
165,Everyone knew Liette dumped Clovis.
166,"She'd wanted a baby forever, but Clovis wanted a union agreement before starting a family."
167,An abusive clause!
168,Remember?
169,I gave this to you on your 40th.
170,Liette was never interested in union matters until she found a document that came from HR.
171,"That day, Clovis found his things in the garden."
172,"To help your colleagues, you should convince them to refuse."
173,Shut up.
174,Can't we be polite?
175,Did you know she slept with this champion?
176,I have the film at home.
177,Want to sabotage negotiations?
178,I want you to take care of AglaÃ© and Marcelle.
179,AnneSophie's right.
180,Why don't they refuse?
181,I don't give a shit about AnneSophie.
182,"I'm going to India, too."
183,You're not going just to piss me off?
184,It'll be good for me.
185,I'll print the contract.
186,"Liette, don't do this..."
187,"Hi, Lola. It's your daughter."
188,I'm going to go work in India.
189,I thought you might want to see me before I left.
190,"Actually, I want my big suitcase."
191,"I know you think a loan's yours after 2 years, but..."
192,"Hi, it's Liette. Call me back."
193,I got a letter from the direction.
194,They won't pay our airfare. Call me.
195,I just spoke to Marcelle. We must meet.
196,I can't afford to move to India with my new salary.
197,It's not us. It's coming from the top.
198,They can't do this. Why are they?
199,They don't want to appear to support you.
200,It gives a bad image.
201,A bad image?
202, They fired us!
203, What will we do?
204,"As things stand, I don't really care."
205,I'll keep my job even if I have to walk there!
206,Who are you threatening?
207, I have a car.
208, What?
209,I have a car. We can drive there.
210, Is it possible?
211, Why not?
212, We can't drive to India!
213, You were going to walk.
214,We could go camping.
215,I don't want to go camping!
216,I want to go to work!
217,I wasn't about to give up before even leaving.
218,"I didn't know much about geography, but I wanted to plan the route."
219,"Since the factory closed, I felt powerless."
220,Couldn't be that complicated to go to India.
221, Why don't you turn off the wipers?
222, Broken.
223,No tune up before leaving?
224,Wasn't worth it just for wipers.
225,We have quite a way to go.
226,I think I'm a bit too fragile to drive to India.
227,I don't think it's a good idea for me.
228, I'll drop you off.
229, What?
230,I'll drop you at a train station if you want.
231,I was thinking out loud.
232,I'd never do a thing like this myself.
233,I'm more of a plane girl.
234,Then you should have gone over the lame French ducks' heads to this guy.
235, Furstenberg?
236, Yeah.
237,"We should be at work, because of him, we're on a tractor's ass."
238, Think it'd bother him if we came by?
239, Hope so!
240,No time for visits.
241,Maybe he'd pity us.
242,He lives in Switzerland.
243,No detours.
244,A tiny one.
245,Must make Frankfurt tonight.
246,I've family there.
247,We'll go to a campsite.
248,I don't want to camp!
249,The trip's useless if we have no fun.
250,Bothering Furstenberg is your idea of fun?
251,Just thinking of it warms my heart.
252,Who's in favor of visiting Furstenberg?
253,Let's go!
254,I don't feel well.
255,Slow down!
256,AglaÃ©?
257,"Well, vomiting all over won't get us there faster."
258,"We hadn't crossed the border yet, and I regretted bringing them."
259,I'd have been better off going alone.
260,"I gave her motion sickness meds, should work."
261,She'll call her folks in 2 days.
262,She never mentions her family.
263,We lunch together but don't know each other.
264,You came to my wedding.
265,"Colleagues are like family, we can't choose."
266,Are you the nurse?
267,"Um, yeah."
268,About time!
269,Should we wake her?
270,When we have plane tickets.
271,Start the car!
272,Start the car!
273,Drive!
274, What's wrong?
275, He fainted.
276,Is he alive?
277,I thought he'd be nicer.
278, Where are we going?
279, Hospital.
280,I don't know where it is!
281,"It's Red Cross land, we'll find one."
282,I'll get a wheelchair.
283,I've got to go pee.
284, Don't leave me with him!
285," Deal with it, hun!"
286,Where am I?
287,You fainted.
288,What?
289,I think you fainted.
290, Are you the nurse?
291, No.
292,Who are you?
293,I'm AglaÃ©.
294,I work in one of your factories.
295,What do you want?
296,"I didn't come see you, my colleagues did."
297, Are you kidnapping me?
298, No.
299, Do you have a gun?
300, No!
301,"You moved us to India, my colleagues want to talk."
302,It's not a kidnapping!
303,"Wait, they went to get you a wheelchair!"
304,Do I look like someone who's told what to do?
305,"See you soon, AglaÃ©."
306,Where's Furstenberg?
307,Furstenberg?
308,This wasn't smart.
309," Let's stop, I'm a bit hungry."
310, No.
311,"No, why?"
312,We're late.
313,We should be in Frankfurt.
314,We have a timetable?
315,"Yes, we won't get to India by dillydallying!"
316,It's going to be a long trip.
317,"Marcelle was right, chicken tandoori was far away."
318, This is it?
319, It was nicer before.
320,Did you hurt yourself?
321,Spencer?
322,Such pigs.
323,Let me help.
324,The dog!
325,Have you eaten?
326,No!
327,Come on!
328,Sigrun's welcome matched my surprise visit.
329,She was as warm as her frozen dinners.
330,Will Spencer be home soon?
331,Spencer's not coming home.
332,What?
333,He changed his life and I'm not part of it.
334,He was useless anyway.
335,Did he mow the grass?
336,Where does he live now?
337,I dunno.
338,I'd like to talk to him.
339,I don't have his number.
340,How will I find him now?
341,He didn't call you?
342,No.
343,You should have told him to call me!
344,I can't chase after him to remind him to call.
345,Who's Spencer?
346,AglaÃ©'s father.
347, Are you her mother?
348, No.
349,AglaÃ©'s a bastard.
350,Do you say bastard?
351,"Thanks to Sigrun, I saw my father sometimes."
352,He was a G.I.
353,on an American base in Germany.
354,He married Sigrun there when she was expecting Tom and GÃ¼nther.
355,It was at an exotic show in BadenBaden that Spencer met my mother.
356,"I didn't see him much as a kid, and despite that, I admired the fool."
357,Enough to have learned English for him.
358,What?
359,Is that baseball?
360,Cricket.
361,Is it good?
362,It relaxes me.
363,You'll see your father another time.
364,I don't think so.
365,You had something to prove?
366,"No, not like you and Clovis."
367,I didn't want him to lose track of me.
368,My fault.
369,I should have known he'd leave.
370,Are you OK?
371,You're right.
372,"I've waited 15 years for Clovis to give me a baby, and now that's the clock's ticking, I go to India."
373,That's not smart.
374,You still look very fertile to me.
375,I'm such an idiot.
376,Did you come to cheer me up?
377,Yeah.
378,You don't talk a lot.
379,I've been waiting for the right moment.
380,Your German's not bad.
381,"True, it's not bad."
382,I'm a surprising woman.
383,A bit like you.
384,"Maybe I need affection, but if I'd wanted a pet to cuddle, I'd have chosen a panda, not a dog that's all wrinkled."
385,I like your character.
386,It goes with your look.
387,"The dress, the glasses, the boots."
388,"You're impetuous, daring."
389,I like that.
390,I only have two spare beds.
391,That's a shame.
392,What are you doing?
393,Clearing. The grass is too high for the lawnmower.
394,We're leaving after breakfast.
395,I think I'll stay here.
396,You can't stay here.
397,Sigrun offered.
398, When?
399, Last night.
400,What the heck?
401,"If baby Jesus made something better, he kept it."
402,Thank you.
403,Enjoy it.
404,What's this with Sigrun?
405,Getting happiness where I can.
406,Seriously?
407, With her stepmother?
408, She's not my stepmother.
409,You can't decide that in one night.
410,"I saw photos of Spencer. I'd prefer him, but I'm too old to be difficult."
411,I won't trip over my own feet for a pecker.
412,And your work?
413,You think I left for work?
414,"You'll mow the lawn, and then what?"
415,Have you seen this place?
416,I'll be busy until I retire!
417,We have no car!
418,I'll give you my car.
419,Really?
420,Yes. I know how much this shitty job means to you.
421, It's not a shitty job.
422, Whatever.
423,It's not a shitty job!
424,You could thank me for the car.
425,Thanks.
426,There.
427,"At least we had a good time, right?"
428,"To be honest, imagining Marcelle there was more traumatic than her departure."
429,But we'd miss her.
430,Especially Liette.
431,Hello?
432,We're in Poland.
433,Where?
434,"I don't know, that's a huge detour."
435,Your orders?
436,Do you speak French?
437,Does it look French here?
438,Pancakes?
439,A mojito.
440,And a mojito.
441,I'll talk to her.
442,"Yes, that's right."
443,Who was that?
444,A factory manager.
445,What did they want?
446,To meet us.
447,Where? We're in Poland.
448,I hate detours.
449,"Hi, I'm Iouliana BolkonskaÃ¯a."
450,You had a nice trip?
451,Please have a seat.
452,Is she a ballerina?
453,"Sorry about the mess, we're redecorating."
454,Seems nice here.
455,"There's a great organic restaurant, a gym, a pool, a game room... It's fantastic."
456,And daycare for my 2 kids.
457,Two?
458,Two years and three months old.
459,Can we transfer here?
460,"No, you're too old."
461,"Perhaps you, but you'd have to correct your work techniques."
462, I don't want to work here.
463, How were you hired?
464,I applied after my masters in business sociology.
465,One condition was to learn French over the summer.
466,Why'd they ask us here?
467,Mr. Longchamp asked us to organize a visit with a French manager.
468,He'll be here soon.
469, Is that Furstenberg?
470, What?
471,On the wall.
472,At the inauguration. You've met?
473,I forgot.
474,We also have a spa with showers.
475,Shame I'm too old and incompetent to work here.
476,You should.
477,Change is normal at times.
478,You've done quality control forever.
479,Look where it got me.
480,I'm not even sure we can drive there.
481,"When we got the car out of the mud, I thought we could make it."
482,Seriously?
483,We'll get there. Together.
484,"Hi, AglaÃ©."
485,"Hi, Liette."
486,Marcelle isn't here?
487,She dumped us in Germany.
488,Did you know he was coming?
489, I negotiated your return.
490, To the factory?
491,"No, the factory's dead."
492,To customer service in Mulhouse.
493,Better conditions than at the factory.
494,Special treatment.
495,"Yeah, right!"
496,Special treatment for himself.
497,Our hands and feet are tied.
498,They demand to see Furstenberg.
499,The real violence comes from our management.
500,Disappeared? You're messing with me.
501,These women just want to be respected...
502,I feed them this shit all the time.
503,Don't try it on me!
504,"Right, we'll be in touch."
505,"...feel they're useful, needed."
506,I'm sick of this.
507,"Now, it's every man for himself."
508,"Clovis was sick of it, too."
509,He missed Liette.
510,The two men negotiated in secret.
511,Longchamp exchanged our return to France for getting out of the meeting room.
512,Forgive me.
513,I've no excuse.
514,Except maybe being overworked.
515,I even miss your damn hair things.
516,You went home?
517,You redecorated.
518,"Stop, I look horrible."
519,You've never been prettier.
520,I've never seen you in a jacket before.
521,Do you still want a baby?
522,No!
523,What's wrong with the contract?
524,"Nothing, I can't work in an office."
525,"If I can, so can you."
526,You never saw me with a Xerox.
527, Give yourself a chance.
528, I am.
529,How is this a chance?
530,"If I make it, I'll really deserve this job."
531,You've nothing to prove.
532,"You're giving up, we're almost there."
533,"You're not even halfway there, Marco Polo."
534,You can't go alone.
535,The hardest is yet to come.
536,One more reason to come with me.
537,Then return to France if you want.
538,I saw your route.
539,It's a straight line at the end.
540,I'm not stopping because you got felt up.
541,You know I want a baby.
542,Have vigintuplets for all I care.
543,You don't know what's waiting there.
544,Did you talk to the people there?
545,I've taken care of myself since I was 10.
546,I know how you feel...
547,"Sure, watch the DVD of Clovis and HR lady to know how I feel!"
548,Let's not part mad.
549,I'm a bit scared for you.
550,"Where you're going, killing blonds may be legal."
551,Can't I say or do something to change your mind?
552,I know this detour was for me.
553,You're worth more than you think.
554,"Call me, OK?"
555,I'll call when I get there.
556,The idea of traveling alone made me uneasy.
557,But maybe it wasn't a bad thing.
558,"I could do as I pleased, and that felt good."
559,"No more detours, no CEO, no father or husband to see."
560,And nothing unexpected.
561,Do you need help?
562,I don't like the way she looks at me.
563,You say that about everyone.
564, What?
565, She's going to India.
566,We shouldn't have picked her up.
567, Is she going to see the elephants?
568, I don't know.
569,What?
570,She does crash tests on cars.
571,"Yes, I'd noticed that."
572,I'm an artist.
573,I draw my own borders!
574,Your papers.
575,Open the trunk.
576,Isn't Filip here today?
577,He's sick.
578,What's that?
579,Just an old wig... full of lice.
580,What's all this stuff for?
581,"We do all kinds of shows, corporate events."
582,We have a wedding tonight.
583,You're performers?
584,"In a previous life, I used be a singer, too."
585,"On a starry night, lit by the moon..."
586,I've forgotten a bit.
587,I'm getting too old for this.
588,"Darling, I'll take you home with me Carrying you in my arms End of the line."
589,I don't understand.
590,Teach us how to play with that!
591,Thank you.
592,Tell her.
593,"I wasn't doing so badly, after all."
594,Daria was probably right.
595,Maybe I was more adventurous than I thought.
596,"I just had to keep going forward, stay on course and be persistent, like in cricket."
597,Like at work.
598,To reassure myself.
599,To be sure everything went well.
600,I had to do whatever it took.
601,It's easier to catch a chicken.
602,Lieutenant!
603, What do I do with her?
604, She has a passport.
605,Aslanov!
606,It's too late to take her to the police.
607,Lock her in the boiler room.
608,The boiler room?
609,There are rats there.
610,It's the only place with a lock.
611,She won't run away from here.
612,Idiot...
613,"I'm not locking her up to stop her escaping, but to keep others away."
614,"I want no trouble, OK?"
615,I can control myself.
616,"I'm not worried about her, but you."
617,"Out of any 10 soldiers, one is always an idiot."
618,Come in.
619,Make yourself at home.
620,Wake up.
621,Are you hungry?
622,Eat.
623,Trip?
624,"Uh, no. Work."
625,Pretty.
626,Magnificent.
627,Magnificent!
628,My motorbike.
629,Trip?
630,You must return to France.
631,Trip.
632,Magnificent.
633,Liette! It's AglaÃ©!
634,Where are you?
635,Dunno. In the desert.
636,There are soldiers everywhere.
637,Where was I?
638,I didn't even know.
639,I went down the only road I could.
640,I never thought I'd get so far on this trip.
641,I wasn't someone who demonstrated or held management hostage or burned tires or stood up for her rights.
642,I'd rather take a shitty job in India than reevaluate myself.
643,That's why I was here.
644,That's why I kept going.
645,Is she dead?
646,I don't know.
647,Don't the bikes work?
648,I'm busy.
649,We found her by the roadside.
650,My God...
651, Is she alive?
652, I don't know.
653,Take that away from here!
654,"I haven't seen you, nor you me."
655,Go away!
656,You little brats!
657,Liette! It's AglaÃ©!
658,AglaÃ©? Where are you? Are you there?
659,Dunno. In the desert.
660,There are soldiers everywhere.
661,"Since my call from the Kazakh military base, Liette had feared the worst."
662,The search for me was equal to her concern.
663,If we don't find her with this...
664,Furstenberg was found on the way to his mansion.
665,My disappearance became a symbol of offshoring.
666,The factory was held responsible for my trip.
667,Which undermined its stocks.
668,"An employee's fate mattered, for once."
669,Come and help me!
670,But they must hurry up and find me.
671,One of the few valid things I had was the visa on my passport.
672,I lost my finger.
673,I made it?
674,I made it!
675, Liette?
676," AglaÃ©, it's you!"
677,I'm so happy to hear your voice.
678,"Me, too."
679,Where were you?
680,I got lost.
681,You were right to continue.
682,They're not closing the factory.
683,You can come back.
684,Are you happy?
685,"Yes, I think so."
686,Are you sure?
687,Yes.
688,Where's the sugar?
689,Under your nose.
690,She's more neurotic than you.
691,I adore her.
692,She makes me feel almost normal.
693,You didn't take the car we sent?
694,What are you doing in India?
695,Keeping you from causing more harm.
696,What harm?
697,"We're still opening the Indian plant, closing a Dutch one, they're less trouble."
698,My airfare would have been cheaper.
699,You're an industrial accident.
700,I got clothes for you.
701,For your press conference.
702,What press conference?
703,"You stirred up shit, now play the game."
704,Don't know if I want to play.
705,"If you wanted my job now, they'd give it to you."
706,Doesn't look fun.
707,I could also thank you for saving my job.
708,"Thanks to you, I stay in a factory with all the people I fired."
709,Bosses who now think I'm a slut.
710,You're welcome.
711,Do it for your colleagues if not for you.
712,Try to rise up to the cause you symbolize.
713,"Otherwise, was it worth losing a finger?"
714,I feel like throwing up.
715,Not a good time.
716,Are you coming?
717,Can I be alone a bit?
718,I'll wait here.
719,My name is AglaÃ©.
720,And I finally quit my job.
721,How did I get here?
722,It's thanks to my uncommonly strong will power and mostly to my pigheadedness.
723,I discovered you can relate to an Indian transsexual more than a next door neighbor.
724,And that a Kazakh soldier can get you pregnant.
725,Maybe that's true globalization.
