35,"...that took so many of their lives, is by eating foods..."
36,"...that were given to them, like the turkey and the squash..."
37,...and all the foods that we think of as our traditional holiday meal.
38,And that's why we celebrate Thanksgiving...
39,...to commemorate the unity between the Indians...
40,Excuse me...
41,...the Native Americans.
42, And the early English settlers who were called... Class?
43,Pilgrims.

58,I'd tell you if you let me talk.
59, What's the name of this place?
60, That's Africa. I know that.
61,"Right, that's Africa."
62,Did you know that Africa is where the body of the first man was found?
63,My daddy says that's where all people originated from.
64,That means everybody's really from Africa. Everybody.
65,All y'all. Everybody.

83,He has an enormous vocabulary.
84,It's just that...
85,"Yes, go on."
86,It's just that he has a very bad temper.
87,It's extremely difficult for him to interact with the other children.
88,Perhaps I could recommend therapy or a child psychologist.
89,"No, thank you."
90,We can manage just fine.
91,Is there some problem in the home?
92,Are you employed?
93,That's none of your business...

101," And why is that, may I ask?"
102, Tre is going to live with his father.

616,"Big old, fat, juicy roll..."

618,"Sitting in a rocking chair, reading the funny papers!"
619,"Then your grandchildren will be running around, saying: ""Granddaddy, give me something."
620,"Give me a dollar."" You think so, huh?"
621,Yeah.
622,"Wait a minute, man."
623,"What's all this about grandkids, man?"
624,You using the rubbers I gave you?
625,"I ain't ready to be a granddaddy, all right? I just..."
626,I ain't ready for all of that.
627,Don't worry.
628,I can take care of myself.
629,"Why are you sweating me, man?"
630,"Tre, close the refrigerator."
631,Close it. Come here.
632,What?

643,"All right, all right."
644,Just sit down for a second.
645,"Go on, sit down, now."
646,"It was a Sunday, right? Rick and l were kicking it up on Crenshaw."
647,This group of females rolled up in a Rabbit.
648,Everybody trying to bumrush them.
649,"Trying to jib and all, right?"
650,"Man, there was this one girl everybody was trying to rush."
651,Baby was fine!
652,"Body was booming, like right out of Jet centerfold."
653,"So I'm, like, eyeballing her."
654,"She walks right up on me and busts out, ""Is this your ride?"" Then I say, ""Yeah, you want to go for a ride with me?"" She says, ""No, I want to drive it."" I say, ""Can you drive stick?"" She says, ""I can learn if you teach me."" I go into mackdaddy mode because I'm getting a woody in my sweats."
655,"I says, ""Why don't you give me your number, I'll call you for a lesson."" She does."
656,"About a week later, I'm over at her house."
657,Her mom and grandma are leaving for church.
658,"I walk right up to the door, man."
659,"As soon as I go inside, boom!"
660,"We go at it, nonstop."
661,"Kissing, hugging, right?"
662,"So I pick her up, take her upstairs."
663,"Well, about 20 minutes into it, Mom and Grandma's come home."
664,Seems Grandma forgot her purse.
665,Wanted to make sure she has something for the collection plate.
666,"Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex in the air or something, right?"
667,She starts straight towards Tisha's room.
668,That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.
669,I call her once in a while...
670,"...but when I do, her mom or grandma say, ""She can't talk right now."
671,"She busy, doing the dishes.""  What'd you use?"
672, I used the number she gave me.
673,Why are you sweating me?
674,I had to use nothing.
675,She said she was on the pill.
676,How many times I tell you?
677,If a girl's on the pill...
678,...you use something anyway.
679,A pill ain't gonna keep your dick from falling off.
680,I don't know why you insist on learning things the hard way...
681,...but you gonna learn.
682,"Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!"

698,Told him I weren't no virgin.
699,"Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?"
700,Is you?
701,"Well, technically speaking, I haven't."
702,"You know, I fingered a couple of honeys..."
703,"...and sucked on some titties, but I ain't never stuck it in."
704,"Why not, man?"
705, You really want to know?
706," Yeah, I asked you, didn't l?"

728, Then you take the phone off the hook!
729," Well, I been busy."
730,"Oh, well, don't give me no baldass excuse for a lie like that!"
731,What did I do that was so bad that you just had to stop talking to me?
732,"See, you know what you did."
733,"See, you gotta get with the program."
734,"I told you about that. I'm Catholic, and it goes against my morals."
735,"Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed to be one of the biggest hootchies."
736, When you bust a cap on somebody?
737," I bust a cap like, blamblam."
738,Damn! God!
739,"Come on, fuck him up, man!"

816,"No, I don't think that's necessary."
817,"Look, Reva. Reva, this is bullshit."
818,"I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous."
819,There's no reason for him to come live with you now.
820,He's not a baby!

909," Yo, check out that 808."
910," Damn, that shit bumping."
911,What are you interested in beside playing ball?
912," Like, what you mean?"
913, I mean...
914,...what do you want to major in? What kind of degree would you pursue?
915,I'm just asking because there's a strong possibility...
916,...that you won't go into the NFL after college.
917,Just a fact. It happens.
918,"Yeah, I heard that before."
919,"Actually, I was thinking about majoring in business."
920,"I got this friend, Tre, who's always talked about going into business."
921,"Plus, I like computers."
922,Maybe I could do that.
923,What do you think?
924,"Young brother, I think you can do anything you put your mind to."
925,I tell you where y'all need to go.

937,"Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going to church to catch no bitches."
938,I should roll your ass up off this porch for that stupid shit.
939,So basically you have a 2.3 overall GPA...

964,My baby is going to a university.
965,I always knew you would amount to something.
966,I did.
967,"When you were little, you used to always run around with that football."
968,"I'm proud of you, baby."
969," Thanks, Mama."
970, You make your mama proud.
971,May I have your attention?
972,The SAT test will be administered in this room.
973,"When you receive your test book, please keep it closed on your desk."
974,Read the directions on the front cover of your test book.
975,Use a number two pencil in marking your answer sheet.
976,Ink or ballpoint pen is not to be used.
977,If you do not have a number two pencil with you...
978,...raise your hand and keep it up.
979,We'll pass a pencil out to you.
980,"During the time allotted for a section, you may work on that section only."

991,"Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't moved two percent in five years."
992," ""Furious Styles Financial.""  Talk to you later."
993,So how you guys think you did on the test?
994,"All right, I guess."
995,Those tests are culturally biased.
996,The only universal part is the math.
997,You boys must be hungry.
998,I'm real surprised to see you.
999,Came to see you.
1000,See how you doing.
1001,How's business going?
1002,"Well, there's always business, just not always in here."
1003,"What do you do, Furious?"
1004,You help people get money for homes or what?
1005,"Well, there is no ""or what."" That's what I do, Rick."
1006, You boys want to see something?
1007, Do we have a choice?
1008,No.
1009,I don't know about all this. Got us walking around Compton and all.
1010,"Rick, it's the '90s."
1011,We can't afford to be afraid of our own people anymore.
1012,Would you two knuckleheads come on?
1013,I want y'all to look at that sign.
1014,See what it says?
1015,"""Cash for your home."" You know what that is?"
1016, It's a billboard.
1017, Billboard.
1018,"What are y'all, Amos and Andy?"
1019,Are you Steppin' and he's Fetchit?
1020,I'm talking about the message.
1021,What it stands for.
1022,"It's called ""gentrification."" It's what happens when property value of a certain area is brought down."
1023, You listening?
1024, Yeah.
1025,They bring the property value down.
1026,They can buy the land cheaper.
1027,"Then they move the people out, raise the value and sell it at a profit."
1028,What we need to do is keep everything in our neighborhood black.
1029,Blackowned with black money.
1030,"Just like the Jews, the Italians, the Mexicans and the Koreans do."
1031,Ain't nobody from outside bringing down the property value.
1032,It's these folk!
1033,Shooting each other and selling that crack rock and shit.
1034,How you think crack gets into the country?
1035,We don't own any planes.
1036,We don't own no ships.
1037,We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
1038,"Every time you turn on a TV, that's what you see."
1039,"Black people selling the rock, pushing the rock. Yeah, I know."
1040,It wasn't a problem when it was here.
1041,Wasn't a problem until it was in Iowa...
1042,...and on Wall Street where there's hardly any black people.
1043,If you want to talk about guns...
1044,...why is it that there's a gun shop on every corner here?
1045, Why?
1046, I'll tell you why.
1047,Same reason there's a liquor store on every corner in the black community.
1048,Why? They want us to kill ourselves.
1049,"You go out to Beverly Hills, you don't see that shit."
1050,They want to us to kill ourselves.
1051,The best way to destroy a people is to take away their ability to reproduce.
1052,Who is it that's dying out here on these streets every night? Y'all.
1053, Yeah.
1054, Young brothers like yourselves.
1055,What am I supposed to do?
1056,"Fool roll up, try to smoke me?"
1057,I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker if he don't kill me first.
1058,You doing exactly what they want you to do.
1059,"You have to think, young brother, about your future."
1060,"Damn, man."
1061,"You know, Furious is deep."
1062, He used to be a preacher?
1063, He ain't never been no preacher.
1064,Just reads a lot.
1065,"My brother should've heard that, man."
1066,Would've done him some good.
1067,Where he at?
1068,"Where else, man? Up on Crenshaw with the rest of them fools."
1069, Let's go.
1070, Cool.
1071," What up, Monster?"
1072," What up, nigga?"
1073,"Goddamn, there's a lot of motherfuckers here."

1075,What?
1076,"Man, shut up."
1077,"Yo, man, you believe in God?"
1078,"Yo, why the fuck y'all get so damn religified lately?"
1079,"Fool, I wasn't even talking to you."
1080,This is an A and B conversation.
1081,You can see your way out of it.
1082,You can see your way out of my ride...
1083,...and we'll see your crippled ass walking home.
1084,"Man, look. Do I believe in God?"
1085,"Yeah, I guess I do."
1086,"How else can you have the sun, moon and stars and shit like that?"
1087,"Sun, moon, stars, quasars."
1088,Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.
1089,There ain't no God.
1090,"If there was a God, why he be letting motherfuckers get smoked?"
1091," Babies and little kids, tell me that."
1092," You tell me this, nigga."
1093,How you know God's a he? He could be a she. You don't know that.
1094,"For one thing, you don't know what the fuck I be motherfucking knowing."
1095,I read about this shit when I was in the pen.
1096,"It was this book, right, and it was telling..."
1097,...life in the perspective if God was a bitch.
1098,"Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't be no nuclear bombs, no wars..."
1099,...because that ain't in a bitch's nature.
1100,"Why every time you talk about a female you say ""bitch"" or ""ho""?"
1101, Because that's what you are.
1102," Nigga, fuck you."
1103,"Hey, hey."
1104,What's up?
1105,"What up, D?"
1106," What's up, Mon?"

1109, Where y'all coming from?
1110, Compton.
1111,"What y'all doing over here, man?"
1112,"We're kicking it. Philosophizing on God, church, bitches and all."
1113,I'm schooling these niggas on the aspect of religion.
1114, Religion?
1115," And on factual, actual studies."
1116,You know what I'm saying?
1117, Y'all coming from Compton?
1118, Yeah.
1119, Thought you were scared of Compton.
1120," Rick was a shivering bitch, boy."
1121,"It was deep, though."
1122,"You should've been there, man."
1123,"Pops was talking, speaking, man."
1124,Speaking the truth and shit.
1125,Your pops is like motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.
1126,"Man, what's wrong with you?"
1127,"Fuck you looking at, nigga?"
1128,"I'm still trying to find out, nigga!"

1130,We got a problem here?
1131,"We got a problem, nigga?"
1132, What up with this?
1133, Put the gun away.
1134,Can't we have one night where nobody gets shot?
1135," Shut up, bitch."
1136," Bitch, I will fuck you up!"
1137,Let's get that bitch!
1138,Fuck you like that.
1139,Ferris always trying to start some shit.
1140,"Nigga can't fight, so he always trying to find an excuse to shoot somebody."
1141,That's why fools be getting shot all the time.

1143,Ignorant.
1144,"Fool, shut up."

1153,Driver! Put your hands on the steering wheel!
1154, Got any drugs or weapons on you?
1155, No.
1156,I didn't do nothing.
1157,You think you tough.
1158,"You think you're tough, huh?"
1159,"You scared now, huh?"
1160,I like that. That's why I took this job.
1161,I hate little motherfuckers like you.
1162,"Little niggers, you ain't shit!"
1163,"Think you tough, huh?"
1164,"I could blow your head off, and you couldn't do shit."
1165,How you feel now?
1166,What set you from?
1167,Look like one of them Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.
1168,"No, you probably one of them Rolling 60s, huh?"
1169,a possible 187 in blue ¤...
1170,...at corner of Florence and Vermont.
1171,"Again, a possible 187 in blue ¤ at corner of Florence and Vermont."
1172,Stay out of trouble.
1173,"You gentlemen have a nice evening now, you hear?"
1174,Hi.
1175, I thought something happened to you.
1176, Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.
1177,I'm tired of hearing them shooting all the time.
1178, What's wrong?
1179, Nothing.
1180,I'm tired of this shit.
1181,Those two motherfuckers.

1190,"Come on at me, motherfucker!"
1191,What's so funny?
1192,I never thought I'd be crying in front of a female.
1193,You can cry in front of me.
1194,What do you think about...
1195,...people getting married while they're still in college?
1196,Are you trying to ask me something?
1197,No.
1198,I just wanted to know what you thought about that kind of situation.
1199,I think it can be good if two people really love each other.
1200,Really?
1201,Yeah.
1202,You sure you're down for this?
1203,Yeah. Are you?
1204,Yeah.
1205,"I mean, yes, I am."
1206,I don't want to get pregnant.
1207,You won't.
1208,Hi. I'm looking for a Miss Devereaux?
1209, She's right over there.
1210, Thank you.
1211, Hey.
1212, Hi.
1213,You look nice.
1214,Thank you. So do you.
1215,Thanks.
1216,Thanks for coming.
1217,So...
1218,So this is...
1219,...definitely you.
1220,And what's that supposed to mean?
1221,I thought we were gonna talk about Tre.
1222,"Espresso, please."
1223,"Café au lait, please."
1224,I bought him some shoes yesterday.
1225,Why are you always buying him stuff?
1226,Can't I be nice to my son?
1227,Do I have that right?
1228,"Yes, but he has a job. You don't have to always buy him stuff."
1229,Look...
1230,...did he tell you he wants to move in with Brandi?
1231,Yeah. So?
1232,"""Yeah. So?"" So don't you think that's a bad idea?"
1233,"I think that Tre is old enough to make his own decisions, Reva."
1234,You're his father. That means you were supposed to guide his decisions.
1235,What have I been doing for the last seven years?
1236," Not that, evidently."
1237," Listen, Reva..."
1238,...it's time for you to let go.
1239,I know you want to play the mommy...
1240,...but Tre is a grown man now.
1241,He's not a little boy anymore.
1242,"That time has passed, sweetheart."
1243,You missed it.
1244,"Excuse me, I'm getting some cigarettes."
1245,You're not getting off that easy.
1246,Sit your ass down.
1247,Excuse me?
1248,I said sit down before I raise my voice and make a fool out of both of us.
1249,Okay.
1250,Now it's my time to talk.
1251,"Of course you took in your son, my son..."
1252,...our son...
1253,...and you taught him to be a man.
1254,I'll give you that...
1255,...because most men ain't man enough to do what you did.
1256,"But that gives you no reason, do you hear me, no reason..."
1257,...to tell me that I can't be a mother to my son.
1258,What you did...
1259,...is no different from what mothers have done from the beginning of time.
1260,It's just too bad more brothers won't do the same.
1261,But don't think you're special.
1262,"You may be cute, but not special."
1263,Drink your café au lait. It's on me.
1264,Everybody in the mall was running.
1265,Bitches running out of Contempo's.
1266,Motherfuckers throwing cookies out the cookie shop.

1273,Niggas getting smoked and shit.
1274,Who's them niggas?
1275,"Man, pick Chris up."
1276,Punk might start trippin'.
1277,That's those fools from Crenshaw.
1278,"Damn, I ain't even got my gat."
1279,Motherfucker ain't got nothing better to do.
1280,Twentyseven years old.
1281,Still fucking motherfuckers our age...
1282,...with his old ass.
1283,What's up?
1284,Anyway...
1285,...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib at 2 in the motherfucking morning.
1286,"Yo, man, that's my business."
1287,"Yeah. Handle your shit, G."
1288," Peer pressure, man."
1289, Handle your shit.
1290,Don't be like this motherfucker.
1291,"This motherfucker got babies, inhouse pussy."
1292,"Let me do shit like that, Ma would be like: ""I ain't having it."" Ricky."

1305,"Ricky, get up and go now."
1306,I can't finish frying the fish without it.
1307,"Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal."
1308,You ought to be happy somebody's cooking for your ass.
1309," Give me some, Dook."
1310," Here, take it."
1311, What's up?
1312, What's happening?
1313,"D, go to the store for me and get some cornmeal?"
1314,"Nigga, I ain't the one she told to go get it. She's your wife."
1315,"She ain't my wife, man."
1316,Shit.
1317,"Might as well be, y'all got a family and shit."
1318,"""Tecmo Bowl"" playing motherfucker."
1319,"Fuck you, man."
1320,Go to the store with me.
1321,"Sure, let's do it."
1322,What?
1323,"Don't fuck me, fuck your wife."
1324,That's why you got a baby.
