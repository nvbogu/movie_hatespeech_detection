626,THEY BELONGED TO BILLY.
627,PUT THEM ON.
628,HE WANTED TO BE A LEADER LIKE HIS FATHER.
629,HE ENDED UP BEING AN IMITATION WHITE MAN.
630,LET'S GO.
631,"WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE."
632,FINELOOKING ANIMAL.
633,PAID $300 FOR THAT HORSE.
634,FINEST BLOODLINE AVAILABLE.
635,$300.
636,"BUT, OF COURSE, A HORSE IS STILL JUST A HORSE."
637,AND A WOMAN?
638,DID THEY SAY WHERE SHE WAS HEADED?
639,NORTH.
640,I THINK I KNOW WHERE.
641,"I'M SENDING MOST OF MY MEN BACK, GOING AHEAD WITH A FEW."
642,YOU CAN COME ALONG IF YOU LIKE.

644,"THAT'S, UM..."
645,"INDIAN COUNTRY, ISN'T IT?"
646,YEAH.
647,"DANGEROUS, ISN'T IT?"
648,FOR YOU AND ME.
649,LESS SO FOR GROBART.
650,"MR. CROCKER, I  THIS MAY SEEM A BIT PRESUMPTUOUS, BUT IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR WIFE WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU?"
651,"NO, IT'S NOT."
652,MMM.
653,I HAD A WOMAN RUN OFF ON ME ONCE.
654,MAILED HER A SUITCASE.
655,"WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, YOU'D BEST DO IT RIGHT."
656,GONNA BE YOUR LAST CHANCE.

679,"GETS COLD, I GUESS."
680,WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
681,THERE'S A MINING TOWN  SOUTH PASS.
682,PEOPLE THERE.
683,I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THEM.
684,IT LOOKS DESERTED.
685,I GUESS THE MINE'S PLAYED OUT.
686,EXCUSE ME.
687,NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
688,GLAD YOU LIKE IT.
689,IT'S ALL RIGHT.
690,WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT WOMAN THAT WAS WAITING FOR THE TRAIN?
691,"OH, SHE'S GONE."
692,WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME AGAIN?
693,CATHERINE.
694,I THOUGHT I PUT TOO MUCH SALT IN THE STEW.
695,YOU ARE THE GODDAMNEDEST WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.
696,WHY DID YOU MARRY HER?
697,IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE.
698,I MARRIED FOR MONEY.
699,"HE WANTED GENTILITY, AND MY FATHER NEEDED MONEY."
700,I DIDN'T ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING MY FATHER WANTED.
701,I LOVED HIM VERY MUCH.
702,"MY FATHER, I MEAN."
703,YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MARRY HIM.
704,NO.
705,YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO...
706,WHAT?
707,BECOME WHAT YOU ARE.
708,NO.
709,LEASTWISE I NEVER SOLD MYSELF.
710,"HELLO, SIS."
711,THOUGHT I'D COME BY AND SEE HOW YOU WERE MAKING OUT.
712,WHERE'S THE CAPTAIN?
713,HE'S ASLEEP.
714,OH.
715,TIRED?
716,EXCUSE ME.
717,"OH, WHERE YOU GOING?"
718,I SAID EXCUSE ME.
719,"YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, YOU UNDERSTAND?"
720,"IF THAT SON OF A BITCH SHOWS UP, I'M GOING TO KILL HIM."
721,"NOW, WHERE'S THE MONEY?"
722,OVER THERE.
723,WHERE'S THE REST?
724,THAT'S ALL THERE IS.
725,TAKE IT AND GO.
726,"OH, I'LL DO THAT, ALL RIGHT."
727,BUT I STILL DON'T FIGURE THAT MAKES ME EVEN.
728,"YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU A LOT."
729,PLEASE.
730,PLEASE?
731,I WONDERED WHAT THE LITTLE RICH LADY WOULD LOOK LIKE UNDRESSED.
732,NOW YOU DO IT.
733,"ALL RIGHT, SIS."
734,COME ON.
735,LET'S GO SEE THE CAPTAIN.
736,"NO, DON'T HURT HIM."
737,DON'T HURT HIM.
738,PLEASE.
739,EASY.
740,REAL EASY.
741,"NOW WE'RE REALLY PARTNERS, CAPTAIN."
742,"NOW, HAND ME THOSE SADDLEBAGS..."

746,AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH!
747,AHH!
748,AHH!
749,KILL HIM.

751,KILL HIM.
752,GOD DAMN IT! KILL HIM!
753,KILL HIM!
754,"DAMN IT, CATHERINE, WHY DIDN'T YOU YELL OUT FOR ME?"
755,I COULDN'T.
756,HE WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU.
757,HYAH. HYAH. COME ON.
758,WILLARD.
759,"GO WITH HIM, CATHERINE."
760,I CAN'T.
761,HA HA HA.
762,YAHOO!
763,WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
764,"I'M HAPPY, THAT'S ALL."
765,WHAT'S THAT?
766,"THAT'S A SHOSHONE'S WAY OF SAYING, ""GO BACK."" COME ON."
767,HOW WILL WE FIND THEM  THE SHOSHONE?
768,THEY'LL FIND US.
769,I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.
770,"I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT A LOT, AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR BABY."
771,YOU WHAT?
772,I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR BABY.
773,"OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, BEEN THROUGH HELL, AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY?"
774,YOUR BABY.
775,MY BABY.
776,ALL RIGHT.
777,TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
778,"OH, II DIDN'T MEAN QUITE LIKE THAT."
779,I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DO IT.
780,"YOU'RE NOT VERY ROMANTIC, ARE YOU?"
781,WHY DO PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE?
782,DAMNED IF I KNOW.
783,I SUPPOSE IT'S LIKE TWO DROPS OF RAIN THAT FALL AND...
784,THEY COME TOGETHER AND BECOME ONE.
785,"NOW, THAT'S ROMANTIC."
786,COME HERE.
787,CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT NOW?
788,"I MEAN, ABOUT CAT DANCING."
789,SHE'S DEAD.
790,IT'S ALL RIGHT.
791,DON'T BE AFRAID.
792,THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
793,"WASHAKIE, YOUR CHIEF, HE WAS MY FRIEND ONCE."
794,"HOW ARE YOU, JOHN WESLEY GROBART?"
795,WASHAKIE REMEMBERS.
796,WHY HAVE YOU COME?
797,I HAVE COME TO CLAIM WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME.
798,MY WIFE CAT DANCING WAS OF THE SHOSHONE TRIBE.
799,MY CHILDREN WERE BORN AFTER  AFTER SAND CREEK AND THE SIOUX AND CHEYENNE WARS.
800,"WHEN MY WIFE DIED, IRON KNIFE BROUGHT MY CHILDREN HERE."
801,I'VE COME TO GET THEM.
802,YOU WILL TALK BETTER WHEN YOU EAT.
803,"OH, THANK YOU."
804,YOU'RE RIGHT.
805,WHAT ARE YOU CALLED?
806,CATHERINE.
807,CATHERINE CROCKER.
808,YOU ARE NOT JOHN GROBART'S WIFE.
809,NO.
810,THE WHITE MEN NEVER LEARN.
811,LEAVE OUT BEST PARTS OF STORY.
812,THE CIGAR WAS ONE OF THE WHITE MAN'S GOOD IDEAS.
813,"NO, THANK YOU."
814,THIS IS A MATTER OF THE BLOOD AND THE HEART.
815,YOU MAY SPEAK TO THE BOY.
816,"WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SON?"
817,MY PEOPLE CALL ME DREAM SPEAKER.
818,DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE NAME THAT YOU WERE BORN WITH?
819,YOU REMEMBER A GAME YOU USED TO PLAY A LONG TIME AGO WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE?
820,YOU LIKED IT VERY MUCH.
821,"YOU USED TO HIDE, AND I'D CALL YOUR NAME OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
822,DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
823,THERE WAS A THING LIKE THE BONES OF A BIG ANTELOPE.
824,YES.
825,YOU COULD SEE THROUGH ITS RIBS.
826,YES.
827,"IT WAS A ROCKING CHAIR, AND YOUR MOTHER LIKED TO SIT IN IT."
828,DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR NAME THEN?
829,JOHN.
830,JOHN.
831,JOHNNY.
832,JOHNNY.
833,YES.
834,JOHNNY.
835,I WANT TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR SISTER AWAY FROM HERE.
836,"WE'LL RIDE IN A TRAIN, GO OVER A MOUNTAIN."
837,WE'LL SEE TREES THAT GROW LIKE THE GRASS GROWS HERE.
838,YOU'LL SEE ALL THOSE THINGS IF YOU COME WITH ME.
839,"IT WILL TAKE A STRONG HEART TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, BUT YOU HAVE A STRONG HEART, JOHN, BECAUSE I GAVE YOU A STRONG HEART, AND IRON KNIFE HAS NOT WEAKENED YOUR HEART."
840,FOR THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO HIM.
841,I...
842,I AM THANKFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RICH FOR TAKING CARE OF MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER.
843,NO.
844,YOU UNDERSTAND WHY GROBART WAS IN PRISON ALL THESE YEARS?
845,FOR THE SHOOTING OF THE MAN WHO LAY WITH CAT DANCING THEN KILLED HER.
846,THAT MAN DID NOT KILL HER.
847,HE KILLED HER.
848,"HE KILLED HER FOR LYING WITH THAT MAN, BUT SHE WAS INNOCENT."
849,THE MAN HAD RAPED HER.
850,"THE BOY TRIED TO TELL HIM, BUT GROBART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE."
851,"HE PUSHED THE BOY ASIDE, AND HE KILLED THAT MAN AS HE RAN."
852,"THEN, STILL RAGING, HE CAME TO CAT DANCING, BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR HER."
853,HE KILLED HER THERE WITH HIS HANDS.
854,NO.
855,"WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT THE BOY HERE, THERE WERE NO NIGHTS WHEN HE SLEPT ALL NIGHT."
856,HE WOKE UP SCREAMING WILD THINGS.
857,IT TOOK ME MANY MONTHS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS BAD DREAMS WERE ABOUT.
858,HE SAW CAT DANCING DIE.
859,HE SAW YOU KILL HIS MOTHER.
860,THE BOY SPEAKS THE TRUTH.
861,YOUR MOTHER...
862,YOUR SISTER...
863,WAS A FAITHFUL WIFE.
864,JAY?
865,"LET IT GO, CATHERINE."
866,"I LOVE YOU, JAY."
867,LET ME HAVE THAT.
868,ARE YOU SUGGESTING I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEPORT MYSELF AMONGST SAVAGES?
869,"COLORFUL SHOW OF WEAPONRY, A SHOW OF FORCE."
870,THEY UNDERSTAND LITTLE ELSE.
871,CATHERINE.
872,"HELLO, WILLARD."
873,I TAKE IT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
874,I'M ALL RIGHT.
875,IT'S ALL HERE.
876,THIS JAY IS FULL OF SURPRISES.
877,WHERE IS HE?
878,HE LEFT.
879,WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO?
880,I INTENDED TO KILL HIM ANYWAY.
881,I CERTAINLY WILL NOW.
882,HYAH! GET UP THERE.
883,GET UP THERE.
884,HYAH! HYAH!
885,"COME ON, BOY. HYAH!"
886,"WHOA, BOY. WHOA."
887,"EASY, BOY."
888,YOU CARE MUCH FOR HIM  JOHN GROBART?
889,"YES, MUCH."
890,"IF YOU WISH TO FOLLOW HIM, I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY HE GOES."
891,"CROCKER, WE KNOW YOUR WIFE'S NOT KIDNAPPED."
892,WE'VE GOT THE MONEY.
893,WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK WITH THEM?
894,LET ME HANDLE THE REST.
895,I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE DAY.
896,THAT'S AS FAR AS MY JURISDICTION GOES.
897,"DREAM SPEAKER, IT'LL BE NIGHT SOON."
898,HOW WILL WE FIND HIM?
899,LET US DIVIDE IN OUR SEARCH.
900,BUT WHAT IF WE LOSE EACH OTHER?
901,CAN YOU DO THIS?
902,CATHERINE.
903,"HOLD ME, PLEASE."
904,JUST HOLD ME.
905,I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU TRACK ME FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR.
906,I WAS HOPING YOU'D GIVE UP.
907,TELL IRON KNIFE I THANK HIM FOR THE HELP OF...
908,HIS SON.
909,"GOODBYE, DREAM SPEAKER."
910,"WE HAVE TIME NOW, DON'T WE, JAY?"

921,I'LL GO WITH YOU.
922,NO.
923,I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
924,I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.
925,"PLEASE, JAY."
926,"GOD DAMN IT, CATHERINE, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN TO DO WHAT I TELL YOU?"
927,I WILL...
928,IF YOU'LL TELL ME JUST ONCE THAT  THAT WHAT?
929,IT DOESN'T MATTER.
930,YOU'RE THE GODDAMNEDEST WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.
931,"OH, MY  I GOT HIM!"
