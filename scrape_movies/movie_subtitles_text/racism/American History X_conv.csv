0,"Fucking pervert, Dan."
1,What the fuck are you thinking?
2,There's a black guy outside breaking into your car.
3,How long's he been there?
4,I don't know.
5,What's going on?
6,"Not right now, honey. How many?"
7,"Danny, how many?"
8,"One, I think."
9,Is he strapped?
10,Does he have a gun?
11,I don'tfucking know.
12,Wait a second.
13,What the fuck is going on?
14,Stay right here and be quiet.
15,"Wait a second, Derek. Wait."
16,Stay right here.
17,I don't have a personal problem with him.
18,"Don't insult my intelligence, Murray."
19,"You hate this child, and I think I know why."
20,Dr. Sweeney's office.
21,I went outwith his mother afew times.
22,Thatwas three years ago.
23,Itwas nothing.
24,Nothing. Really?
25,That paper...
26,"Bob, it's a travesty."
27,Arguingfor Hitler as a civil rights hero.
28,You've got to draw the line.
29,"Murray, you actually did this to yourself."
30,You told them to do a report...
31,on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights...
32,in plain English.
33,I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused...
34,and harbours some sick ideas...
35,but I am not ready to give up on him yet.
36,His brother probably put him up to it.
37,I guarantee you 100%...
38,his brother did not put him up to this.
39,Lfind that hard to believe.
40,I know he was a good kid...
41,"and it's a shame what he's been through, but that's dangerous."
42,Dangerous in whatway?
43,That goes too far.
44,"This racist propaganda, ""Mein Kampf"" psychobabble..."
45,"he learned this nonsense, and he can unlearn it, too."
46,I will not give up on this child yet.
47,I knew itwas you.
48,"Danny, get in here."
49,I said get in here!
50,Get in here!
51,"Five, four, three,two..."
52,Shut the door!
53,"What's it gonna be, Danny?"
54,What's what gonna be?
55,This petty crap you're pulling.
56,I don't know.
57,Have a seat.
58,How are you doing?
59,Fine.
60,Things at home OK?
61,"Derek got out this morning, did he not?"
62,"Yeah, he did."
63,He was one of my students.
64,"You knew that, right?"
65,Honours English.
66,He was a brilliant student like you...
67,but he hung out with simplemindedfools...
68,also like you.
69,Did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?
70,What happened to him has nothing to do with me.
71,Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.
72,Ifollowed directions.
73,"I wrote an ""A"" Paper."
74,"""Mein Kampf""?"
75,I should expel you.
76,Go ahead. You don't think I could handle it?
77,No. I think the street would kill you.
78,Your rhetoric and your propaganda...
79,aren't going to save you out there.
80,So here's the drill.
81,I'm your history teacher from now on.
82,We will discuss current events.
83,We will call this class...
84,American History X.
85,We meet once a day.
86,All right.
87,Yourfirst assignment...
88,is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
89,"Come on, Sweeney. It took me a week to read ""Mein Kampf."" What do you want me to do it on?"
90,Your brother.
91,"Oh, God, man."
92,Please tell me you're joking.
93,No. I'm not kidding.
94,I want you to analyse and interpret all the events...
95,surrounding Derek's incarceration.
96,How these events helped shape your present perspective...
97,concerning life in contemporary America.
98,"The impact on your life, yourfamily's."
99,"Whatever you want to say, Danny."
100,I'll be the only one reading it.
101,But if it's not on my desk tomorrow morning...
102,you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.
103,You clear?
104,"Yeah, I'm clear."
105,Telling teacher I'm fuckin' cheatin'!
106,Is thatwhat's happening?
107,I never cheated in my life.
108,Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.
109,I didn't say anything!
110,Why you trippin' on me?
111,Now why you all kicking it like that?
112,"What's up, man?"
113,What you scaredfor?
114,I ain't gonna do nothing.
115,What's up?
116,"Want some, too, bitch?"
117,"Punk, what's wrong with you?"
118,You want to die?
119,Punkass white boy.
120,You lucky I gotta go to class.
121,He ain't gonna do nothing.
122,He don'twanna see me and the heater.
123,Lucky the bell rung.
124,I would have clocked thatwhite boy.
125,Punkass motherfucker.
126,Should smoke thatfool.
127,You gottafucking stand up for yourself.
128,We got a whole file on skinheads here.
129,Part of the same gang?
130,Venice Beach gang.
131,"Actually, he's done a stretch at Y.A."
132,"This guy C. C., is that him?"
133,"Yeah, that's him right there."
134,"This morning we have a guest, and there he is."
135,Good morning.
136,"Morning, sir."
137,Good to see you.
138,Good morning.
139,This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
140,He's principal over at Venice Beach High.
141,"For some time now, he's been doing outreach work..."
142,with gangs both in and out of the can.
143,"Three years ago, a local kid named Derek Vinyard..."
144,was sent upfor murdering a couple of Crips...
145,who were trying to jack his car.
146,"Bob taught Vinyard, and he's followed this case closely."
147,"He was a skinhead, right?"
148,"He was more like ""the"" skinhead..."
149,the protégé of Cameron Alexander.
150, Who?
151, Cameron Alexander.
152,Here you go. Have a looksee.
153,"Cameron Alexander, well, he's a Venice Beach landmark."
154,He's the biggest distributor and writer...
155,of White Power literature and videos in L.A. County.
156,"He promotes White Power bands, he writes reviews..."
157,"and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns."
158, Does he have a record?
159, He's pretty clean.
160,"Been trying to pin something to him, but it doesn'twork."
161,Trust me.
162,He's behind all of it.
163,He runs everything out of his house by the beach.
164,There were no white gangs in Venice Beach...
165,before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.
166,Alexanderfound in Derek his shining prince.
167,"Essentially, he used Derek to recruit..."
168,"a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids."
169,"This kid Vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage..."
170,as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of NBC.
171,"Earliertoday, L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard..."
172,was shot and killed battling a blaze...
173,at a suspected Compton drug den.
174,We're at the Vinyard home now...
175,and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek...
176,has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
177,"Derek, if you could come down here please for a second."
178,"Look, I know this is tough, but how do youfeel right now?"
179,How do you think lfeel?
180, I think it's typical.
181, Typical how?
182,"Well, this country's becoming a haven for criminals..."
183,so what do you expect?
184,Decent hardworking Americans like my dad...
185,are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
186,Parasites?
187,"Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever."
188,I don't understand.
189,You think maybe yourfather's murderwas racerelated?
190,"Yeah, it's racerelated."
191,Every problem in this country is racerelated.
192,Not just crime.
193,"It's immigration,AIDS, welfare."
194,Those are problems of the black community...
195,"the Hispanic community, the Asian community."
196,They're notwhite problems.
197,Aren't those really issues that deal more with poverty?
198,No. They're not products of their environments.
199,Minorities don't give two shits about this country.
200,"They come here to exploit it, not to embrace it."
201,Millions of white Europeans came here andflourished...
202,within a generation.
203,What the fuck is the matter with these people?
204,They have to go around shooting atfiremen.
205,What does this have to do with the murder of yourfather?
206,Because my fatherwas murdered doing his job!
207,Putting out afire in afucking nigger neighbourhood...
208,he shouldn't have given a shit about.
209,He got shot by afucking drug dealer...
210,who probably still collects a welfare cheque.
211,Derek Vinyard was quietly releasedfrom Chino...
212,early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
213,I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
214,If something happens to him...
215,things could get very ugly down by the beach.
216,Just keep it low.
217,Venice Beach didn't always look like this.
218,It used to be a great neighbourhood.
219,The boardwalk's always been a dump...
220,butwhen my dad moved us out here...
221,"Venice was a nice, quiet place to grow up."
222,"Overthe years, though, it's just gone to hell."
223,The gangs are like a plague.
224,They moved westfrom Inglewood and South Central...
225,and basically took over.
226,I ain'tfoulin' you!
227,I ain't got time for all this bullshit.
228,Fuck y'all.
229,You all right?
230,I'm all right.
231,"Yo, is that thatfool you was telling me about?"
232,"Yeah, that's that motherfucker."
233,"Yeah, man, that's him."
234,Bitchass motherfucker.
235,That's why Derek started the D.O.C.
236,He said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared...
237,"in their own neighbourhood, andfor a while there..."
238,we really made it like itwas ours again.
239,Throw the ball!
240,"Come on, Curtis!"
241,Quit chucking it up.
242,Pass the ball.
243,"""D"" up!"
244,"Come on, let's go."
245,Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
246,He does a spin move every time.
247,"You ain't gettin' shit, motherfucker."
248,"This one's for you, boy!"
249,What the fuck you...
250,"Who you callin' boy, motherfucker?"
251,"You're lucky, motherfucker!"
252,I'm through monkeying around with yourfucking ass!
253,"Pale, pasty, pastramieating, cracker motherfucker."
254,A hundred bucks say I make you my bitch.
255,Hearthat?
256,He's trying to make ends meet...
257,for his cut in welfare.
258,You're on!
259,"It's eightsix, Seth."
260,"When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it."
261,Come on. I can't coverthis.
262,Help me out here.
263,You got a bigfucking mouth.
264,I can take this niglet down.
265,You couldn't take a shit.
266,What are you thinking?
267,I will beat him.
268,Give me the money.
269,Shut up.
270,You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
271,I'll take care of this.
272,"Yo, I ain't got time forthis."
273,Hey!
274,I got a bet.
275,I come in this game right now.
276,Same score...
277,butwe play black guys against the white guys.
278,"Name your price, cracker."
279,No money. Forthese courts.
280,And not just today. For good.
281,"If you win, we will walk away..."
282,"but if we win, no bitching, no fighting."
283,"Right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit..."
284,and get your black asses out of here.
285,Fuck that. Take this bet.
286,Eight to six. Our ball.
287,Let's go.
288,Pick him up!
289,"Seth, get back and play some ""D."" Defence!"
290,Pass the fucking ball!
291,I was wide open!
292,Bullshit.
293,That's fuckin' offence.
294,Get out of here.
295,He moved his feet.
296,"You want to go, I'm ready!"
297,Don't throw elbows at me!
298,"You want to go,Adolf Hitler wannabe motherfucker?"
299, You OK?
300, Yeah. Give me some water.
301,You gotta call offence on that shit.
302,"Not on game point, Danny."
303,You can't let those niggers get away with that shit.
304,It's game point.
305,Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.
306,Watch this.
307,Byebye.
308,Get the fuck off my court!
309,This is my house!
310,"Fuck you, bitch!"
311,Get the fuck out of here!
312,This is my court!
313,Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.
314,He said itwould make it just too hardfor him...
315,"and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow."
316,"Three years without him, justwondering."
317,And then at 7:00 this morning...
318,we picked him up outside the gate.
319,"The whole ride back, he didn't say anything."
320,"I wanted to stay home, but he said..."
321,"""No. Go to school."
322,"I'll see you later."" Oh, come on."
323,Give the guy a break.
324,"What? You too big to give me a hug, tough guy?"
325,"No, man. I just know you're gonna need someone..."
326,to look after you while you adjust to all this space.
327,"Yeah, right."
328,This place is smaller than the old living room.
329,How you doing? How's school?
330,It's good.
331,You gotta do something about that hair.
332,That do's gotta go.
333, The girls like it.
334," Well, I don't."
335,You're keeping it pretty close.
336,You took it all the way down.
337,"Shit. Look. Iforgot, man."
338,It hurt like shit when they put it on.
339,When'd you get that?
340,I got it about a month ago.
341,Cameron made it official.
342,He put this on you?
343,What?
344,"Oh, hi. He's here."
345,"Derek, it's for you."
346,Nothing.
347,Is there a phone in the back?
348,I'll get it in the back.
349,I got it. Yeah?
350,"Oh, hey."
351,What?
352,My eyes have seen the glory...
353,of the trampling at the zoo.
354,We've washed ourselves in nigger's blood...
355,"and all the mongrels, too."
356,We're taking down the Zog machine...
357,Jew by Jew by Jew.
358,The white man marches on.
359,You think ourfriend was behind that?
360,I don't even care.
361,I'm gonna take care of that tonight.
362,My sweet kids. My baby boy.
363,"God, what's with the love fest, you guys?"
364,No. He'll do it.
365,I'll make sure he does it.
366,I'll get it.
367,I came to see the man.
368, Can youfit through the door?
369, Fuck you!
370,"What's up, Dan? How you doing?"
371, Where's Derek?
372, He's on the phone.
373,"Come out, youfree motherfucker!"
374,Where the fuck are you?
375,Hang on. Give me a minute.
376,I'll be out in a minute.
377,I'll be careful.
378,I'm not gonna stay in my room the rest of my life.
379,Hold on.
380,Hey. What the fuck is Seth doing here?
381,Did you invite him over?
382,No. He always comes over here.
383,"Danny, give me a minute."
384,Just give me one minute.
385,"Are you still here, Goodyear?"
386,"You calling me a blimp, youfucking Democrat?"
387,When was the last time you were actually able to see yourfeet?
388,"Come in here, Danny."
389,Are you going to Cam's party tonight?
390,Is Davina's ass watertight?
391,"You're fucking sick, man."
392,"All right, relax."
393,Let me ask you afew questions.
394,I'm not in the mood.
395,I got homework.
396,"Tell me some of the shit you've learned, fuckass..."
397,before I pistolwhip you.
398,"OK. I believe in death, destruction..."
399,"chaos, filth, and greed."
400,"Cut the shit, Dan. Come on."
401,Tell me what I want to hear.
402,You mean that shit about your mother?
403,"You want to get fucking beaten, Danny?"
404,I'm notfucking talking to you.
405,Shut up.
406,"Look, you gotta let me do this my own way, all right?"
407,I'll take care of it.
408,"Who do you hate, Danny?"
409,I hate anyone that isn'twhite Protestant.
410,Why?
411,They're a burden to the advancement of the white race.
412,Some are all right.
413,"None of them are fucking all right, OK?"
414,They're all a bunch of fuckingfreeloaders.
415,We don't know 'em.
416,We don'twant to know 'em.
417,They're the fucking enemy.
418,What don't you like about them...
419,and say itwith some fucking conviction.
420,I hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
421,I hate this hiphop influence on white fucking surburbia.
422,Good.
423,I hate Tabitha Soren and her Zionist MTVfucking pigs...
424,telling us we should get along.
425,"Save the rhetorical bullshit, Hillary Rodham Clinton..."
426,'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
427,That's some of the best shit I've ever heard.
428,"Lfeel sorry for you, Danny."
429,"You don't believe any of that shit, right?"
430,Shut up.
431,"No. Get out of the house now, you piece of shit."
432,"Is that any way to talk to a guest, afriend?"
433,"Derek hates you, and you don't realize it."
434,How do you know who I hate?
435,Back from the dead.
436,God bless Jesus Christ.
437,"God, I think you lostweight."
438,I can get my arms almost all the way around you.
439,"Fifty fuckin' pounds, man."
440,Look at this hair. Holy shit.
441,I told him it's gotta go.
442,Grab your jacket.
443,Let's get the fuck out of here.
444,I want to talk to him.
445,One second.
446,"Hey, listen. Did you pull some shit in school today?"
447, Just the usual.
448, This kid is awesome as hell.
449,"Did you turn in a paper on ""Mein Kampf""?"
450, Sweeney shit his pants.
451," He did, man."
452,Was that your idea or did Cameron put you up to that?
453,No. I thought itwould be cool.
454,How'd you know?
455,It doesn't matter how I knew.
456,This kid is smart as hell.
457,Was that Sweeney on the phone?
458,Sweeney called and told me.
459,"God, I hate thatfucking nigger, man."
460,He's gotta get afucking life.
461,Sweeney's a good teacher.
462,Sweeney is a nigger on a powertrip.
463,That's what he was like when we were there...
464,and that's how he is now.
465,It'll never change.
466,Fuck that nigger!
467," Seth, go away."
468, Are you kidding?
469,Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
470,I want to talk to my brother.
471,I've been here 15 minutes.
472,I'm starving.
473,"Come here. Seriously, look."
474,Forget this yahoo.
475,He kills bugs for a living.
476,You don'twant to be like that.
477,I'm serious. It's notfunny.
478,Sweeney is a good teacher.
479,You can learn a lotfrom him.
480,Don't go fuck it up with smallfry shit like that.
481,You don't understand.
482,You got to see the bullshit paper he's making me write.
483,He told me all about it.
484,I don't care.
485,You do anything he tells you to do. I mean it.
486,I don'twant you getting in trouble in school...
487,"trying to impress me, taking this shit in there."
488,Do you understand what I'm saying?
489,"Yeah, I guess, but, I mean, I thought you'd be happy."
490,"Well, I'm not."
491,Listen to that.
492,"Yeah, I know."
493,It's been getting worse.
494,Don'tworry about it.
495,I'll talk to you about this later.
496,She's coughing her lungs out...
497,and you're blowing this in herface all day.
498,I'm putting it out.
499,"Hey, come on."
500,I want to talk to you.
501,"Mommy, are you OK?"
502,Put that out.
503,I was just yelling at him for blowing smoke in yourface.
504,"Nice thing to come home to, huh?"
505,You all right?
506,You all right?
507,"Look, you got to take it easy."
508,You got to get some rest.
509,"Take Danny's and my room, and we'll hit the couch."
510,I've been on the couch for ages.
511,The couch is fine.
512,"No, it's notfine."
513,This is terrible.
514,We can't live like this.
515,We gotta get out of here.
516,Can I go with you?
517,Yeah.
518,We all gotta get out of here.
519, I could drop out and get a job.
520, Absolutely not.
521,You got to finish.
522,I'll work something out.
523,"Derek, can we please go eat?"
524,I'm fucking starving here.
525,Go wait in the living room.
526,I want him out of my house.
527,I know. Look.
528,He's an idiot.
529,He's always been an idiot.
530,He can't help it.
531,I got to do that paper.
532,I'll catch up with you latertonight.
533,Not at Cameron's. I need you to stay away from there.
534, We were going to hang.
535, I'll explain it later.
536,"I just need you to stay away from the party, all right?"
537,Whatever.
538,Promise me you'll stay away from that party tonight.
539,"I'm notfucking 14 anymore, all right?"
540,Whatever.
541,God!
542,"Come on, let's go."
543,Where are you parked?
544,Out back.
545,"Yeah, that's the whole bunch."
546,It didn't take longfor Derek to make a name for himself...
547,and Cameron knew just how to use it.
548,You don'twant to stick around?
549,"You know I'd love to, but I got to be careful."
550,"Yeah, I know."
551,I'll see you back at the house.
552,Good luck.
553,"He sent Derek to the kids, to the frustrated ones..."
554,the ones who were sick of getting their asses kicked...
555,by black and Mexican gangs.
556,"""Don't just be some punk."
557,"Be part of something."" All right, let's go."
558,Pull it together.
559,And everybody ate it up.
560,They did whatever Derek told them to.
561,Let's go. We're not here to fucking socialize.
562,Shut the fuck up.
563,"Yeah, man."
564,You want a little toke?
565,Go ahead.
566," Curtis, what is that?"
567," Come on, Derek."
568,Weed is for niggers.
569,Put that away right now.
570,Jesus fucking Christ.
571,Have a little self respect.
572,"All right, listen up."
573,We need to open our eyes.
574,There's overtwo million illegal immigrants...
575,bedding down in this state tonight.
576,This state spent three billion dollars last year...
577,on services forthose people who had no right to be here.
578,Three billion dollars.
579,$400 million just to lock up illegal immigrant criminals...
580,who only got into this country because the INS decided...
581,it's notworth the effort to screen for convictedfelons.
582,Our government doesn't give a shit.
583,"Our border policy is a joke, so is anybody surprised..."
584,that south of the border they're laughing at us?
585,Laughing at our laws?
586,"Every night, thousands of these parasites..."
587,stream across the border like some fucking piñata exploded.
588,Don't laugh.
589,There's nothingfunny here.
590,This is about your life and mine.
591,"It's about decent, hardworking Americans..."
592,falling through the cracks and getting the shaft...
593,because their government cares more about the rights...
594,of a bunch of people who aren't even citizens.
595,On the Statue of Liberty it says...
596,"""Give me yourtired, your hungry, your poor."" Well, it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor."
597,Until you take care of that...
598,"close the fucking book, because we're losing."
599,We're losing our right to pursue our destiny.
600,We're losing ourfreedom so a bunch of fuckingforeigners...
601,can come in here and exploit our country.
602,And this isn't something that's going on far away.
603,This isn't happening places we can't do anything about it.
604,It's happening here.
605,Right in our neighbourhood.
606,Right in that building behind you.
607,Archie Miller ran that grocery store since we were kids here.
608,Dave worked there.
609,Mike worked there.
610,"He went under, and now some fucking Korean owns it..."
611,who fired these guys and is making a killing...
612,because he hired I see this shit going on...
613,and I don't see anybody doing anything about it...
614,and itfucking pisses me off.
615,So look around you.
616,This isn't ourfucking neighbourhood.
617,It's a battlefield.
618,We're on a battlefield tonight.
619,Make a decision.
620,Are we going to stand on the sidelines?
621,Quietly standing there while our country gets raped?
622,Are we going to ante up and do something about it?
623,You're goddamn right.
624,Come here!
625,Don't you know it's illegal...
626,"to hire fucking border jumpers, you nip bastard?"
627,"Hey, sweetheart."
628,No. You don't need this.
629,We're not going to hurt you.
630,"Please, please! No!"
631,Youfucking spic!
632, No! Please!
633, This bitch deserves it.
634,This bitch stinks. Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.
635,Here we go.
636,Goddamn!
637,"Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!"
638,Viva la Mexico!
639,"Have afucking bean, youfucking beaner!"
640,Get some of that in there.
641,Throw it on.
642,That's a great colour on you.
643,Now you can get a white woman's job.
644,"A little better than this one, huh?"
645,"Yeah, white."
646,Then you'll move up in the world.
647,Asshole!
648,Let's go!
649,Everybody out!
650,Now! Now!
651,"All right, let's go!"
652,Come on!
653,"Come on, let's go."
654,"No green card, no fucking work."
655,Comprende?
656,Come on!
657,We're fucking going! Come on!
658,"Dad was gone, but things were almost normal again."
659,Derek had a good job.
660,Mom was starting to live a little.
661,"Everyone was feeling so good, we just didn't see it coming."
662,Maybe we should've.
663,The irony is that most of the stores...
664,destroyed during the riots were owned by black people.
665,"That's stupid, though."
666,Why trash your neighbourhood?
667,"Well, that's my point."
668,It's an irrational act.
669,It's like an expression of rage...
670,by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
671,It's like we had in Watts orthe riots in Chicago in '68.
672,I don't buy that.
673,Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage.
674,That's such a copout.
675,It's opportunism at its worst.
676,It's people grabbing any excuse they can find...
677,"to go and loot a store, nothing more."
678,The fact that these people ripped off the stores...
679,"in their own communities, all that reflects..."
680,is that they have no respect forthe law at all...
681,and certainly no concept of community...
682,or civic responsibility.
683,Now wait a minute.
684,"White people commit crimes againstwhite people, too."
685,"Yeah, but they're not offing each other in record numbers."
686,"Look at the statistics, for Christ's sake."
687,One in every three black males...
688,is in some phase of the correctional system.
689,Is that a coincidence...
690,or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
691,Not only that.
692,They're proud of it.
693,Maybe it says something about prejudice...
694,in the judicial system.
695,If you want to talk about criminal statistics...
696,take a look at the social inequalities that produce them.
697,That's exactly what I hate.
698,You're taking one thing and calling it something else...
699,and just alleviating the responsibility...
700,these people have fortheir own actions.
701,"It's like saying, it's not a riot, it's rage."
702,"It's not crime, it's poverty."
703,That's just nonsense.
704,It's exactly what happened in this trial...
705,because the media twisted things around...
706,so people got allfocused on these cops...
707,and whether or not they were going to get convicted...
708,and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.
709,Everybody lost sight of old Rodney King himself.
710,The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.
711,He's high as a goddamn kite...
712,driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
713,He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops...
714,and he attacks them.
715,He attacked police officers.
716,"That's the bottom line, and he walked."
717,And there's some yahoo there with a video camera...
718,who turned it on halfway through...
719,so that all we see is them hitting him.
720,You got Powell and Koon cracking him with billy clubs...
721,and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull...
722,"so it looks severe, you know?"
723,"People are going, ""Oh, this poor guy."" This poor guy who attackedfour cops..."
724,and those cops end up on the stand...
725,defending themselves for using standard textbook procedures.
726,I don't think the tapes showed that at all.
727,You didn't think so?
728,And you're an authority?
729,"Murray, what do you think?"
730,I did think the police used their clubs rather excessively.
731,Who are you to say what's excessive?
732,I think itwas totally appropriate.
733,They're in a better position to make that call than you are.
734,"We, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority..."
735,"to make those calls, because we acknowledge..."
736,that their job is difficult and dangerous.
737,Very few people respect that and respect that authority.
738,Look who's talking about respect... Mr. Junior KKK.
739,What?
740,You want to go to college?
741,Learn to listen.
742,I didn't say I respect the laws.
743,I acknowledge a cop's authority.
744,I don't respect laws that let Rodney King back on the street.
745,"Second, I am not a member of a lowrent..."
746,disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK. Please.
747,So take your head out of your ass.
748,You've gotten off the point.
749,I had a point.
750,Thatwasn't even the point.
751,Do you have one?
752,What is your point?
753,"All right, think about this."
754,If Danny was walking across the street that night...
755,and Rodney King plowed into him...
756,Can we drop this Rodney King thing?
757,Who would like some dessert?
758,We're having a discussion.
759,"We're having a nice discussion, right?"
760,If Rodney King had been driving along...
761,hopped up on PCP and had killed Danny...
762,you'd be singing a different tune...
763,"I didn't see him hit anybody, and neither did you."
764,"He didn't happen to kill anybody, thank God."
765,"Keep it down, OK?"
766,Ally's sleeping.
767,If thatfucking monkey had run some kid over...
768,everybody would have a very different opinion.
769,They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.
770,"But instead, he just attacked afew cops..."
771,"so, suddenly, it's Hands Across America..."
772,forthis fucking total son of a bitch.
773,It blows my mind.
774,We're so hung up on this notion thatwe have some obligation...
775,to help this struggling black man.
776,Cut him some slack until he can overcome...
777,these historical injustices.
778,It's crap. This stuff just perpetuates it...
779,all this liberal nonsense.
780,Everyone's looking the otherway...
781,while our country rots from the inside out.
782,"I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves 130 years ago."
783,How long does it take to get your act together?
784,"Jews have been persecuted for over 5,000 years."
785,Are you saying it's wrong to feel sensitive...
786,about antiSemitism?
787,"Oh, forget that."
788,"I'm with you. I'm with you all the way, baby."
789,I'm so sick of these liberal hypocrites.
790,Here we go again.
791,I love this part.
792,This is great.
793,Look how they scapegoated Chief Gates.
794,Think they would've come down that hard on Willie Williams?
795,No way. That videotape was a setup to get rid of Gates.
796, Can I be excused?
797, No. Don't interrupt.
798,Excuse me. I was talking.
799,I listened to you.
800, Who do you think you are?
801, She's making a point.
802,"Davina, sit down."
803,Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!
804," Derek, calm down."
805, Don't tell him to shut up!
806,Sit your ass down. No.
807,Sit down. Shut your mouth.
808,Move! Goddamn it! Move!
809,Shut your mouth and give my girlfriend respect.
810,"Derek, what are you trying to prove?"
811,"Murray, stay out of it!"
812,Where do you think you're going?
813,"Derek, let her go!"
814,"You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina!"
815,Shut yourfucking mouth!
816,Stop!
817,She can't breathe!
818,Let her go!
819,You going to apologize?
820,You're afucking asshole.
821,I hate you!
822,What are you doing?
823,This is yourfamily.
824,Right.
825,"My family, so you know what?"
826,I don't give two shits about you orwhat you think.
827,You're not a part of it.
828, That has nothing to do with it.
829, It doesn't?
830,You don't think I see what you're doing?
831,You think I'll sit here and smile...
832,while some fucking kike tries to fuck my mother?
833,It's never going to happen.
834,Fuckingforget it.
835,Notwhile I'm in this family.
836,I willfucking cut your Shylock nose off...
837,and stick it up your ass before I let that happen.
838,Coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner...
839,"with yourJewish, niggerloving, hippie bullshit."
840,Fuck you. Fuck you.
841,"Yeah, walk out."
842,Asshole. Fucking cabalareading motherfucker.
843,Get out of my house.
844,You see this?
845,That means notwelcome.
846,What did I do?
847,You disgust me.
848,"Bring him to ourtable, primping your hair and your dress."
849,What did I do?
850,You're all tarted up.
851,How could you bring him to my father's table?
852,How could you go from Dad to that? Aren't you ashamed?
853,I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!
854,Go run to yourfucking kike!
855,Run to him!
856,It's OK.
857,"I'm proud of you, baby."
858,"I'm so sorry, Doris."
859,I really am.
860,He's gone.
861,He's just a boy without afather.
862,"Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in."
863,Goodbye.
864,"Hey, you all right?"
865," Take this, youfucking dick!"
866, No. Come here.
867, Fuck you!
868, Calm down.
869, Let go of me!
870, Calm down.
871,"Let me go, God damn it!"
872, Fuck you!
873, I'm sorry.
874,I would never hurt you.
875,You know that.
876,I screwed up. I lost control.
877,It's not you.
878,I'm sorry.
879,I'd never hurt you guys.
880,You know that.
881,I'd do anythingfor you.
882,I don't believe you.
883,"I trust you, Derek."
884,What are you doing out of bed?
885,Want a plane ride?
886, Yeah.
887, Goingfortakeoff.
888,"Oh, no, don't crash."
889,Better go to Mom.
890,She's a crazy flier.
891,"Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah."
892, You don'tfeel too hot.
893, No. It's my chest.
894, What are you up to?
895, I'm just thinking.
896,Yeah? There's a lot of that going around.
897,I don't even know how we got here sometimes.
898,"Lfeel like I let you down, only I didn't know when it happened."
899,"Mom, it's OK."
900,It's cold in here.
901,No wonder you're sick.
902,You don't get sick from cold.
903,You get sick from germs.
904,No. You get sick from smoking.
905,You ought to quit.
906,It's not goodfor you.
907,What are you looking at me like thatfor?
908,When are you going to let that beautiful hair grow back?
909,The day you quit smoking.
910,Deal.
911,I'd better get Ally to bed.
912,You say good night to Mom?
913,Then you have to go to bed.
914,Come on.
915," Good night, Mama."
916," Good night, baby."
917,I go back to that night again and again in my mind.
918,I try to stop itfrom happening.
919,I want you out of this house.
920,That's fine.
921,I'll be gone in the morning.
922,He can move in with me.
923,"In my mind, I imagine whatwould've happened..."
924,if I hadn't gone to that room and told him.
925,Get down!
926,"No, Derek!"
927,"Help, Mommy!"
928,"Nigger, you justfucked with the wrong bull. Come here!"
929,Damn!
930,Should've learned your place on the fucking basketball court...
931,but youfucking monkeys never get the message!
932,"My father gave me that truck, you motherfucker!"
933,You ever shoot atfiremen?
934,You shoot at my family?
935,"I'm going to teach you a real lesson now, motherfucker."
936,Put yourfucking mouth on the kerb.
937,"Hold on, man."
938,Put it on the kerb right now!
939,That's it.
940,"Derek, no!"
941,Now say good night.
942,Fucker.
943,Drop yourweapon!
944,Put yourweapon on the ground!
945,Put your hands up!
946,I said get your hands up!
947,Now turn around!
948,Put your hands behind your head!
949,Get down on your knees right now!
950,It's all right.
951,Let's go.
952, Come on.
953, No.
954,She ain't gonna open the door?
955,Someone rightfucking there looking at us. Hello?
956,"Danny, it's for you."
957,Be right there.
958,"Open the door, Danny."
959,It's fuckingfreezing!
960,"Danny, I'm gonna be sick!"
961,"Come on, Danny!"
962,I'm gonna go get some beers.
963,"Hey, what a party, fatso?"
964,"I'm notfat, asshole!"
965,I'm husky!
966,"What the fuck's up, Seth?"
967,"Drink up, Danny, before your brother sees you."
968,"Holy fuck, he's here!"
969,"Yeah, he's fucking here."
970,Go pay your respects.
971,"Fuck you, Seth!"
972,"Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny."
973, Father Vinyard?
974, How's it going?
975,"I'm Jason, this is Chris."
976,We're friends with your brother.
977,"You are afucking god, man!"
978,I thought you turned that paper in.
979,I did. Now fucking Murray turned me in...
980,so Sweeney's making me write another one.
981,Good old Sweeney.
982,He never stops trying.
983,"He's one of those ""proud to be nigger"" people."
984,I hate those guys.
985,"Wait a minute, Danny."
986,He's not proud.
987,"No. He's a manipulative, self righteous Uncle Tom."
988,He's making youfeel guilty aboutwriting on Adolf Hitler.
989,"Some nigger, some spic writes about Martin Luther King..."
990,orfucking Cesar commie Chavez gets a pat on the head.
991,Yeah.
992,"You can see the hypocrisy in that, can't you?"
993,Definitely.
994,"Come on, let's go."
995,No. Listen. Wait.
996,"I want to see you, OK?"
997,"I do, but I gotta take care of something tonight."
998, OK.
999, You understand?
1000,Yeah. I'm here.
1001,"When you're ready, I'm here."
1002, Would you do something with me?
1003, Anything.
1004,Leave with me.
1005,Leave where?
1006,Leave here. Leave all this.
1007,Just come with me.
1008,Why would you want to leave?
1009,They worship you.
1010,You're like a god to them.
1011,"If we had it good before, wait till you see what it's like now."
1012,I don'twant all that.
1013,I don'twant my family involved.
1014,"Everything I've done here fucked it all up, understand?"
1015,You think what you did was wrong?
1016,"Oh, baby. Oh, come on."
1017,Those niggers got exactly what they deserved...
1018,and we all know that.
1019,"I understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you."
1020,No one can touch you.
1021,There's a small army out there.
1022,We're not gonna let a bunch of spooks kick us out.
1023,You're not listening to me.
1024,I'm not scared.
1025,I don'twant it anymore.
1026,I'm done with it.
1027,I'm through with this.
1028,"It's bullshit, Stacey."
1029,"You don't need this, Stacey."
1030,"Come on, trust me."
1031,"If you want to be with me, just trust me. Come with me."
1032,Come on.
1033,You're nuts. You are nuts.
1034,No way.
1035,I don't think you realize what's been going on here.
1036,"We are 10 times whatwe were, and we are bloody organized."
1037,It is like nothing you have ever seen.
1038,This was a mistake. Forget it.
1039,Wait a second.
1040,Whatwas a mistake?
1041,"Stacey,just say goodbye."
1042,This isn't you. I know you.
1043,"You don't know anything about me, Stacey."
1044, Are you Danny's brother?
1045, Yeah.
1046,Will you tell him Lizzy's lookingfor him?
1047,Thank you.
1048,"We'll let the niggers, kikes, and spics grab forthe pie."
1049,Can't blame 'em.
1050,"Course, they're gonna have to fight to get it."
1051,And if we scare the fuck out of people...
1052,"and afew people get killed in the process, so be it."
1053,"Gonna put that in your paper, Danny?"
1054,"Hey, man."
1055,"Well, look who's here."
1056,The return of the soldier.
1057,"What are you doing here, Danny?"
1058,"Come on, man."
1059,I had to check it out.
1060,You knew I was gonna come.
1061,"Let the kid alone, Derek."
1062,He knows when to go to bed.
1063,Go wait outside.
1064,"Come on, Der."
1065,I'm not doing anything.
1066,This little blonde girl keeps askingfor you.
1067,She's dying. Come on.
1068, I gotta check out.
1069, Go easy on her.
1070,All right.
1071,Waitfor me right outside.
1072,Take it easy.
1073,Chill out.
1074,You're on safe ground.
1075,You don't have to watch your ass around here.
1076,Come on. Sit down. Relax.
1077,I'm sorry.
1078,The party was a little quick...
1079,"butwe're just so damn glad you're back, Derek."
1080,It's only natural you shouldfeel a little funny.
1081,"I don'tfeelfunny, Cam."
1082,You made the fat kid a little nervous.
1083,He thinks the joint messed with your mind.
1084,It did.
1085,"Glory, glory, hallelujah..."

1255,'Cause I control the underwear.
1256,"We pick 'em up over here, and we store 'em overthere."
1257,"And I hope you work out, all right?"

1281,What's that all about?
1282,"That's just politics, man."
1283,"Favours, you know?"

1293,You know what?
1294,I don'tfucking give a shit.

1296,He shouldn't be doing that.
1297,"I'm getting sick of it, man."

1313,He's always bragging about you to Cameron...
1314,and all his new friends.
1315,He's starting to remind me of you.
1316,"Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?"
1317,I'm sure he's fine.
1318,"He's 16 years old, Doris."
1319,He's not gonna be a little angelforever.
1320,You think because I watched my firstborn...
1321,fuck up his entire life that I can sit here...

1457,"I ran out, the owner's right behind me yelling."
1458,Bam! I run into three cops.

1489,"Well, he took six stitches."
1490,"Man, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?"
1491,"I came to talk about Danny, but we don't have to do that now."
1492,I brought you some books.
1493,"What about him, you know?"
1494,Don't keep me in suspense.
1495,He's headed rightwhere you are.
1496,You know what? My mother already laid this trip on me.
1497,Danny's not my responsibility.
1498,What do you expect me to do with that?
1499,It doesn't help me.
1500,Am I supposed to feel guilty?
1501,I don'twant you to do anything.
1502,I need to know the truth about how youfeel.
1503,You think I want him in here?
1504,I mean... I don't know.

1510,"Well, that happens."
1511,You are too damn smart to be floating around here...
1512,pretending you don't see all the holes in this bullshit.
1513,"Hey, listen."
1514,I said I was confused.
1515,I didn't say I didn't believe in it.
1516,All right. That's why you have to stay open.
1517,"Right now, your anger is consuming you here."
1518,Your anger is shutting down the brain God gave you.
1519,"God. You know, man?"
1520,You've been talking about...
1521,what's going on with me since I was in high school.
1522,How the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
1523,"No, I know about me."
1524,I know about this place.
1525,I know about the place you are in.
1526,What do you know about the place I'm in?
1527,There was a moment...
1528,when I used to blame everything and everyone...
1529,for all the pain and suffering...
1530,and vile things that happened to me...
1531,that I saw happen to my people.
1532,Used to blame everybody.
1533,"Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God."
1534,I didn't get no answers 'cause I asked the wrong questions.
1535,You have to ask the right question.
1536,Like what?
1537,Has anything you've done made your life better?
1538,"You gotta help me, man."
1539,Just help me.
1540,"Get me out of here, you know?"
1541,I'm up in four months for review.
1542,Put in a wordfor me.
1543,"I already have. So you're out there, and then what?"
1544,I don'twant to fuck up my family anymore.
1545,I'll go as far away as I can get.
1546,That's not good enough.
1547,"You want my help, you gotta do betterthan that."
1548,My help is not unconditional.
1549,Running just ain't good enough.
1550,Fuck him. Fuck him.
1551,Fuck him.
1552,Let the niggers have him.
1553,"What's up, D?"
1554,What's all that bullshit you pulled in the mess hall?
1555,You out of yourfuckin' mind?
1556,Are youfuckin' crazy?
1557,"D, look at me, man!"
1558,You can't make it in here on your own.
1559,I'm not afraid of those fuckin' pussies.
1560,"There was six of them, and they jumped me."
1561,Thatwon't happen again.
1562,I hope they fuckin' try.
1563,"Man, I'm not talking about your peckerwoodfriends!"
1564,They're protecting your stupid ass!
1565,You dissed them in public!
1566,Now you're on yourfuckin' own!
1567,"Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers, all right?"
1568,"They'llfuck you, then smoke your motherfucking ass!"
1569,Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
1570,You think I haven't thought about that?
1571,"If they come for me, they come."
1572,There ain't nothing I can do.
1573,"What can I do, man?"
1574,So I was right back where I started.
1575,Every day I was sure itwas my day.
1576,Every time I stepped out of my cell...
1577,every time I got in that shower...
1578,lfigured itwas only a matter of time...
1579,before they made a move.
1580,I just hoped it'd be quick.
1581,But it never came.
1582,I couldn'tfigure it out.
1583,I knew some of them were itchingfor it.
1584,"After awhile, I just put my head down..."
1585,and read the stuff that Sweeney sent me...
1586,and I kept to myself.
1587,"Last six months in that place, I was like a ghost."
1588,"What's up, man?"
1589,You getting out?
1590,"Come on, man."
1591,What the fuck you waiting on?
1592,"Get the fuck on outta here, man."
1593,"Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling."
1594,"Oh, yeah? What's that?"
1595,I'm thinking maybe the only reason...
1596,I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.
1597,"Come on, man!"
1598,Get the fuck outta here!
1599,You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line...
1600,for some crazy ass peckerwood?
1601,Yeah. Right.
1602,Stupid.
1603,That's what I thought.
1604,"I owe you, man."
1605,"Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?"
1606,"Yes, I do."
1607,You'll be outta here in no time.
1608,"Man, it's a piece of cake, all right?"
1609,"Just take it easy on the brothers, all right?"
1610,The brothers!
1611,"God, man."
1612,"Sorry, Derek."
1613,Sorry that happened to you.
1614,"Well, I'm not. I'm lucky."
1615,"Lfeel lucky, 'cause it's wrong, Dan."
1616,"It's wrong, and itwas eating me up."
1617,Itwas gonna kill me.
1618,And I kept asking myself all the time...
1619,"how did I buy into this shit, you know?"
1620,It's just 'cause I was pissed off.
1621,Nothing I ever did evertook thatfeeling away.
1622,"I killed two guys, Danny."
1623,I killed them.
1624,And it didn't make me feel any different.
1625,Just got me more lost...
1626,"and I'm tired of feeling pissedoff, Danny."
1627,I'm just tired of it.
1628,And I'm not telling you what to do.
1629,I'm really not.
1630,But I need you to understand...
1631,"'cause I love you, and you're my bestfriend."
1632,Do you understand?
1633,"Yeah, I understand."
1634,All right.
1635,Jesus.
1636,Hi. Everything OK?
1637,"Ah, everything's great."
1638,Great. Yeah.
1639,You wanna sleep in our room?
1640, No. Thank you.
1641, You sure?
1642,Yeah. This is good.
1643,Thank you.
1644,"All right. Come on, let's go."
1645,Good night.
1646,"I'm gonna take a shower, all right?"
1647,It's hard to look back...
1648,and see the truth about people you love.
1649,I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did...
1650,and where it all started...
1651,he'd still say it started when ourfatherwas murdered.
1652,"The truth is, it started earlier."
1653,Are we all meeting forthe game tonight?
1654,Definitely.
1655,"All right, Ben's Burger at 7:00..."
1656,then we go watch the big guy play.
1657,Psyching upforthe game?
1658,I'm always ready forthat.
1659,I got an English exam.
1660,I'm having a heart attack.
1661,I'm not ready.
1662,What's the matter?
1663,"Afraid you'll get a ""B""?"
1664,Might do you good. Bminus.
1665,"Hey, don't laugh."
1666,This guy is different.
1667,Dr. Sweeney.
1668,This guy's unbelievable.
1669,Unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this.
1670,He's got two Ph.D.s.
1671,I don't know what he's doing teaching at our school.
1672,What's he got you reading?
1673,"We got this essay exam on ""Native Son."" ""Native Son""?"
1674,I don't know that.
1675,That's a big surprise.
1676,What? I read.
1677,"Honey, they don't teach Tom Clancy in school."
1678,"Well, they don't."
1679,"So what is this ""Native Son""?"
1680,It's this book about this black guy.
1681,We're doing this whole black literature unit.
1682,Is it Black History Month?
1683,"No, it's just this guy Sweeney, you know?"
1684,It's part of the course now.
1685,What?
1686,Nothing. It's just...
1687,It's everywhere I look now.
1688,What?
1689,This affirmative blacktion.
1690,Afew new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.
1691,"Read the book, ace the guy's test."
1692,Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.
1693,Just 'cause you see it on the evening news...
1694,"I know, butwhat?"
1695,All this stuff about making everything equal.
1696,It's not that simple.
1697,"Now you got this book ""Native Son."" What happened to the other books in the course?"
1698,They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two Ph.D. Says so?
1699,Now you gotta trade in great books for black books?
1700,Does that make sense?
1701,"You gotta question these things, Derek."
1702,You gotta look at the whole picture.
1703,We're talking about books here.
1704,I'm also talking about my job.
1705,I got two black guys on my squad now...
1706,who got their job over a couple of white guys...
1707,who actually scored higher on the test.
1708,Does that make sense?
1709,"Everything's equal now, but I got two guys watching my back..."
1710,responsible for my life who aren't as good.
1711,They only got the job because they were black...
1712,not because they were the best.
1713, That sucks.
1714, Is thatwhat America's about?
1715,"No,America's about best man forthe job."
1716,"You do your best, you get the job."
1717,This affirmativeaction crap...
1718,I don't know what that's about.
1719,There's like some hidden agenda or something going on.
1720,You see what I'm saying?
1721,"Yeah, I do. I didn't think about it like that."
1722,"This guy, though... I don't know."
1723,"Dr. Sweeney, he comes on so strong..."
1724,it's hard not to listen to him...
1725,but maybe some of what he says is kinda...
1726,It's bullshit.
1727,"Yeah. Yeah, maybe."
1728,No. It's nigger bullshit.
1729," You see that, don't you?"
1730, Yeah.
1731,You gotta watch outforthat.
1732,"Yeah. No, I getwhat you're saying. I will."
1733,Good boy.
1734,I'm proud of you.
1735,Don'tworry about it. I got it.
1736,And in about one minute...
1737,I'm gonna watch the sun come up.
1738,I don't know if I've ever done that.
1739,"Anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over."
1740,"Itwon't be easy, butwe're all together again..."
1741,and lfeel good.
1742,I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted...
1743,if I hit the social significance...
1744,orwhatever you're lookingfor...
1745,"butforwhat it's worth, thanks a lot."
1746,Wow. You look great.
1747,Look at you.
1748,Yeah. Gotta dress up forthe parole officer.
1749,Is she cute?
1750,She is afat guy named Hector...
1751, Oh. Well...
1752, So I'm out of luck.
1753,I just gotta check in...
1754,then I'm gonna see about getting my old job back.
1755, Great.
1756, Good morning.
1757,"Davina, can you help?"
1758,Your sister's gonna help you.
1759,You look great. Knock 'em dead.
1760,Thanks.
1761,"Come on, sweetie. Whatwould you like to weartoday?"
1762, You do look good.
1763, Yeah? Lfeel silly.
1764, You look good.
1765, Yeah?

1767,"Yeah. Lfeel, you know..."
1768,a little...
1769,I'm getting there.
1770,Listen... I don't know...
1771,I don't know if it's OK that I'm here.
1772,I want to be here.
1773, I'm gonna get a paper.
1774, Cool.
1775, What do you want?
1776, Maple bar and a large milk.
1777,All right. I got it.
1778,Let me get a coffee...
1779,"a maple bar, and a large milk to go."
1780,Right away.
1781,"Derek, we need to talk."
1782,What's going on?
1783,Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan are at the ICU at St. John's.
1784,They were jumped last night near Ben's Burgers.
1785,How bad?
1786,"Well, it looks like they're gonna live."
1787, Then they got lucky.
1788," Somebody's gotta lose, though."
1789,What?
1790,We were kinda hoping maybe you'd talk to your old crew...
1791,Come on. No way.
1792,"If there's anybody they're gonna listen to, it's you."
1793,"No. I hate to tell you, but I'm out, OK?"
1794,Those guys are probably gunningfor me now.
1795,"We're asking for your help here, Derek."
1796,Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
1797,This has got nothing to do with me anymore.
1798,"Yes, it does. It has everything to do with you."
1799,"God, what are you doing to me?"
1800,I'm doing my best!
1801,I'm going like this just to keep my family in the clear.
1802,Don't ask me to fix this fuckin' situation!
1803, I'm not asking that.
1804, Itwas there before me.
1805,You helped create it.
1806,You wanna take a break now?
1807,"You take a break, you'llfind no peace."
1808,The way to find peace is to stick.
1809,It's not gonna make afuckin' bit of difference.
1810, It might.
1811, Not a bit.
1812,"I mean, do you know what you're asking me to do?"
1813,Yes. I'm asking you to do whatever's in your powerto do.
1814,"Oh, man."
1815,Fuck.
1816,All right.
1817,You know what you're gonna do?
1818,Get me shot by white boys.
1819,I doubt it.
1820,"We're all gonna have a laugh at that, let me tell ya."
1821,I'm gonna take him to school.
1822,I'll be back in half an hour.
1823,Come on.
1824,"Hey, you. You got something goodfor me this morning?"
1825,"I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney."
1826," Yeah, OK."
1827, All right.
1828,What's goin' on?
1829,"Come on, let's go."
1830,"It's just so badfor Seth, man."
1831,I wonder how bad they gotfucked up.
1832,I'm glad they're not dead.
1833,"Otherthan that, I don't care."
1834,Should we visit them?
1835,No. Definitely not.
1836,Just stay out of it.
1837,Listen. I saw a car cruising by the house last night...
1838,when I pulled out of there with Seth.
1839,"If you get home before me today, give a look around the street."
1840,Make sure there's nothing going on.
1841,"Man, this is bad."
1842," They're after you, man."
1843, It'll cool off.
1844,"If I made it through Chino, this should be a piece of cake."
1845,You gonna be OK?
1846,What are you gonna do?
1847,I'll work it out.
1848,"Keep your head up, all right?"
1849,Things are gonna be fine.
1850,It's gonna be fine.
1851,Go turn that paper in.
1852,All right. See ya.
1853,Come here.
1854,I'll see you at home.
1855,All right?
1856,"Yeah, I'll see you."
1857,"Good luck, all right?"
1858, Yeah.
1859, See you later.
1860, Gonna be late.
1861, We better go.
1862,All right. Come on.
1863,Bye.
1864,I'll catch up with you.
1865,See you later.
1866,Get out of my way!
1867,All right! Let him go!
1868,"Oh, no."
1869,"Aw,Jesus."
1870,"Oh,Jesus."
1871,"God, what did I do?"
1872,So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned.
1873,"My conclusion, right?"
1874,"Well, my conclusion is hate is baggage."
1875,Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.
1876,It's just notworth it.
1877,Derek says it's always good to end a paperwith a quote.
1878,He says someone else has already said it best...
1879,so if you can't top it...
1880,stealfrom them and go out strong.
1881,So I picked a guy I thought you'd like.
1882,"""We are not enemies, butfriends."
1883,"""We must not be enemies."
1884,"""Though passion may have strained..."
1885,"""we must not break our bonds of affection."
1886,"""The mystic chords of memory..."
1887,"""will swell when again touched..."
1888,"""as surely they will be..."
