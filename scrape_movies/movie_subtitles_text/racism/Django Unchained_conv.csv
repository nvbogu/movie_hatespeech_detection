90,"Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale."
91,Do you have one?
92," You go to hell, dentist."
93, scoffs I thought not.
94,No worries. I come prepared.
95,Thank you.
96,This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
97,nickering Whoa.
98,"Now, as to you poor devils."
99,"So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices."
100,"One: Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town."
101,"Which would be at least Or two: You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country."
102,Choice is yours.
103,"Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one."

115,That's a nigger on a horse.
116,What's everybody staring at?

133, What kind of dentist are you?
134," chortles Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years."
135,"But these days, I practice a new profession..."
136,...bounty hunter.
137,Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
138,No.
139,Well...
140,"...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter deals in corpses."
141,tsking Hat Prost.
142,The state places a bounty on a man's head.
143,"I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man."
144,"After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities."
145,Sometimes that's easier said than done.
146,"I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed, I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty."
147,"So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business."
148,What's a bounty?
149,It's like a reward.
150,You kill people?
151,And they give you a reward?
152,"Certain people, yeah."
153,Bad people?
154,"Ah! Badder they are, bigger the reward."
155,Which brings me to you.
156,"And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you."
157,"On one hand, I despise slavery."
158,"On the other hand, I need your help."
159,"If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better."
160,"So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit."
161,"Still, having said that, I feel guilty."
162,"So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement."
163,I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
164,"However, at this endeavor, I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like."
165,But you do. Don't ya?
166,I know what they look like all right.
167,Good. So here's my agreement.
168, You travel with me until we find them.
169, Where we goin'?
170,"I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where."
171,That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
172,"And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them."
173,"You do that, I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75."
174,"And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff."
175,"scoffs OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out."
176," overlapping chatter  All right, folks, calm down."
177,Go about your business.
178,These jokers will be gone soon.
179,"Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?"
180,And scare all these nice people.
181,You ain't got nothing better to do than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?

196,You got one chance to get out of this alive.
197,"You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean right now."
198,Schultz Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?
199,"Yes, it is."
200,This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
201,"Schultz Na wunderbar, marshal."
202,"I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, I am ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head."
203,"I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America, I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies before I've had my day in court."
204,You mean like you did our sheriff.
205,Shot him down like a dog in the street.
206,"Yes, that's exactly what I mean."
207,Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?
208,"Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town."
209,"Fair enough, marshal."
210,Here we come.
211,They're a little tense out there.
212,"So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking."
213, doors squeaking open  Come ahead.
214,You unarmed?
215,"Schultz Yes, indeed we are."
216,"Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?"
217, Go on.
218, Thank you.
219,My name is Dr. King Schultz.
220,"Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court."
221,"The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of $200."
222,"Now that's $200, dead or alive."
223,"The hell, you say!"
224,I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.
225,But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?
226,Yeah.
227,"Schultz I know this because three years ago, he was rustling cattle from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas."
228,"Now, this is a warrant made out by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas."
229,You're encouraged to wire him.
230,He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was.
231,"guns uncocking In other words, marshal, you owe me $200."
232,mediumtempo song plays I'll be damned.

234,What's your plan after that?
235,"Find my wife, and buy her freedom."
236,"Django, I had no idea you were a married man."
237,Do most slaves believe in marriage?
238,"Oh, me and my wife do."
239,Old Man Carrucan didn't.

252,In Greenville...

279,Do you understand?
280,Yeah. Don't break character.
281,And your character is that of The Valet.

446,"I realize passions are high, but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead."
447,"Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?"
448,Gimme.

535,Broomhilda is a German name.
536,"If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German."
537,Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?
538,Broomhilda is the name of a character in the most popular of all the German legends.
539,There's a story about Broomhilda?
540,"Oh, yes, there is."
541, Do you know it?
542," Oh, every German knows that story."
543,Would you like me to tell you?
544,"Well, Broomhilda was a princess."
545,"She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods."
546,"Anyway, her father is really mad at her."
547,What she do?
548,I can't exactly remember.
549,She disobeys him in some way.
550,So he puts her on top of the mountain.
551,Broomhilda's on a mountain?
552,"It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere."
553,And he puts a firebreathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
554,And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.
555,"And there, Broomhilda shall remain."
556,Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.
557,Does a fella arise?
558,"Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does."
559,A fella named Siegfried.
560,Does Siegfried save her?
561,Quite spectacularly so.
562,"He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it."
563,"He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him."
564,And he walks through hellfire...
565,...because Broomhilda's worth it.
566,I know how he feel.
567,I think I'm just starting to realize that.
568,"Now, look, Django..."
569,...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...

572,"Free or not, it's just too dangerous."
573,But let me ask you a question.
574,How do you like the bounty hunting business?
575,Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
576,What's not to like?
577,"Now, I have to admit, we make a good team."
578,I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
579,"Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous, but normally, that's a good thing."
580,How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
581,"What you mean ""partner up""?"
582,You work with me through the winter till the snow melts...
583,...I give you a third of my bounties.
584,"So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself and we'll find where they sent your wife."
585,Why you care what happen to me?
586,Why you care if I find my wife?
587,Frankly...
588,...I've never given anybody their freedom before.
589,"And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you."
590,"Plus, when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal."
591,"As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda."

1088," Well, you got a problem with that?"
1089,"Oh, no."
1090,"I ain't got no problem with it, if you ain't got no problem with burnin' the bed, the sheets, the pillowcases, everything else when this blackass motherfucker's gone!"
1091,That is my problem!

1116, Hm?
1117,Yeah. About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?
1118,Nigger gal?
1119,"Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German."
1120,"Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?"
1121,"Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?"
1122,"laughs You little dickens, you."
1123,I don't see why not.
1124,"Stephen, when you get through showin' them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up and smellin' real nice, and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here."
1125,"Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there'sa somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet."
1126, What?
1127," stammers Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box."

1140,"Bill and Cody went lookin' for her, found her, brung her back."
1141,"Now, she a little beatup."

1148,"Because I said so, that's why."
1149,Dr. Schultz is my guest.
1150,Hildi is my nigger.
1151,Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.
1152," But, Monsieur Candie, she run off."
1153," Jesus Christ, Stephen."
1154,What is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
1155,"Now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out."
1156,Yes sir.
1157,Calvin Lara Lee!
1158,Will you and Cora be responsible for gettin' Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1176,"Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz."
1177,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda."
1178,I've heard a lot of good things about you.
1179,"Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know."
1180," chuckles  forced chuckle As I look at you now, Broomhilda, I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified."
1181,The doctor here speaks German.
1182,And I've been informed you do as well?
1183,"Go ahead, girl."
1184,Speak a little German.
1185,Speaking German Ha! laughs Astonishing.

1198, Get your big pretty ass out the way.
1199, You know you like it.
1200,laughs That's 'cause you knows what I like.
1201,Ooh!
1202,"Come on with these biscuits, girl."
1203,"Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it."
1204,But the best three by far were Samson...
1205, What's that other one's name?
1206, Goldie.
1207,Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
1208,"By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?"
1209,chuckles You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
1210,"His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold. Who knows?"
1211,"all laugh Well, regardless, Samson's your best."
1212,We all know that.
1213,"You will never sell him, and I can see why. He's a champion."
1214,Hmhm.
1215,All three are champions.
1216,Samson's the champion.
1217,Them other two pretty good.
1218,"Calvin, now what's this nigger you let..."
1219,It's all right.
1220,"You have to understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus."
1221,Is that right?
1222,"Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation."
1223,Hm.
1224,I need something more than just a big nigger.
1225,"Yeah, he needs to have panache."
1226, Need to have what? What?
1227, Panache. Uh...
1228, A sense of Showmanship.
1229," Showmanship, yes."
1230,I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules.
1231,"all chuckling The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?"
1232,More like Niggerles.
1233,"laughing I said, and I quote: ""I would pay top dollar for..."
1234,"...'the right nigger.""' Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se."
1235,But is he right as rain?
1236,"Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here."
1237,Nobody.
1238,But one must not forget the most important thing  in the nigger fight game.
1239, Hmmm.
1240,And that is a nigger that can win fights.
1241,Hmmm.
1242,"Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern."
1243,"Now, after you have that, and you know you have that, then you can start to implement a grand design."
1244,"In other words, first thing is first."
1245,First thing's first.
1246,whispers in German Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.
1247,Famously.
1248,"Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear your native tongue in four years."
1249,"Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston."
1250,laughing Two weeks in Boston!
1251," Monsieur Candie, you a mess!"
1252, coughing Stephen Two weeks in Boston!
1253,I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.
1254,And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.
1255,"Calvin Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz."
1256,You mighta caught yourself  a little dose of nigger love.
1257, Hm!
1258,"Calvin Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy."
1259, Stephen Hm!
1260, It's like a pool of black tar.
1261,"Once it catches your ass, you're caught."
1262,"Yessir, you stuck. laughs Lara Lee I don't know, doctor."
1263,"You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django."
1264,"Lara Lee giggles Well, naturally."
1265,"It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention,  not the plucked chicken."
1266," all chuckle Calvin Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself."
1267,You are quite the dapper European gentleman.
1268,"Cora You got to clean these dishes, you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?"
1269,"You know that nigger, don't you?"
1270, Who?
1271," ""Who?"" Don't ""who"" me, bitch."
1272,You know who I'm talkin' about.
1273,At the table?
1274,I don't know him.
1275, You don't know him.
1276, No.
1277," ""No,"" what?"
1278," No, sir."
1279,"chuckles You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?"
1280,OK.
1281,Yeah. If you say so.
1282,"Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it."
1283,"But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him."
1284,What would your price be?
1285,"Well, if I was inclined to be generous..."
1286,...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...
1287,"...9,000. Maybe."
1288,"Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about."
1289,"You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger."
1290,Sure wasn't.
1291,It was you who approached me to buy one.
1292, Sure was.
1293," Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been bandyin' about, that ain't too far off from right."
1294,"And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,  I could do so any day of the week."
1295, Any day.
1296,"But, like you said in Greenville, doctor... I don't want to sell him."
1297,"It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000  that made me even consider it."
1298, Hmmm.
1299,"deep inhale You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion."
1300,chuckles slamming table Why not?
1301,"Monsieur Candie, you have a deal."
1302," Eskimo Joe, $12,000."
1303," banging table Hooray, doctor."
1304,Hooray.
1305,And a wise decision that is.
1306,"However, that is a tremendous amount of money."
1307,"And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer."
1308,Persnickety man named Tuttle.
1309,And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
1310,Hmmm.
1311,Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined  by a physician of my choosing.
1312, Calvin Naturally.
1313,"So, say I return in about..."
1314, ...five days time.
1315, Five days?
1316,With my Mr. Tuttle.
1317,And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy can hash out the finer details between themselves.
1318,"I say splendid, doctor. Splendid."
1319,Gentlemen...
1320,...may I propose a toast.
1321,To Eskimo Joe.
1322,Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
1323, all chuckling  To The Black Hercules.

1328,"Hildi, top my drink off."
1329,"So, Hildi, how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House, huh?"
1330,"When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers."
1331," I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie."
1332, Hmmm.
1333,It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.
1334,"But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,  huh, sugar bear?"
1335," Oh, Lord, she like them niggers."
1336, Sure do.
1337, Like Samson? Huh?
1338,"Hildi No, sir."
1339,"You know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back, seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from."
1340,"Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here, did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off?"
1341,"No, we just talked and..."
1342,"Calvin Oh, so you haven't seen her back?"
1343, I haven't...
1344," No, no, no, no."
1345,"Stephen's right, you might find this interesting."
1346,"Hildi, go on, take off your dress."

1352,They don't got niggers there.
1353,He is a man of medicine.
1354,"I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain."
1355,"These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it."
1356,Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.
1357,"Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind."
1358, Stephen Sure would.
1359," Calvin Look at that, doctor."
1360, It's like a paintin'. Look at that.

1385, Why is I'm scaring you?
1386, Because you scary.
1387,Schultz To speak German this afternoon with Hildi was positively soulenriching.
1388,"Calvin Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that."
1389,You stay right here.
1390,Schultz You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
1391,"Why,yes."
1392,"Yessiree bob, I did."

1404, If'n you could manage it.
1405, Why?
1406, It's about dessert.
1407, What about dessert?
1408,I'd rather discuss that in private.
1409,We're having white cake!
1410,What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?
1411,"You right, Monsieur Candie."
1412,You right. I'll handle it myself.
1413,whispers Meet me in the library.
1414,I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.
1415,"Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me."
1416,"Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily."
1417,Yes sir.
1418,"Well, gentlemen, as you can see, talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required."
1419,all chuckle If you'll excuse me a moment.
1420,Calvin You may clear the dinner service.
1421,Cora You heard him. Go on!
1422,"Get! Hurry up, girl."
1423,"So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus."
1424,chuckles The circus?
1425,fire crackling What is the matter?
1426,Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
1427, They wants that girl.
1428," chuckling Stephen, what the hell are you talking about? Hm?"
1429,They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about.
1430,They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie.
1431,They here for that girl.
1432,Wh... What girl? Hildi?
1433,"Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django, them niggers know each other."
1434,He just bought Eskimo Joe.
1435, Did he give you any money?
1436, No! Not yet. But...
1437,Then he ain't bought diddly.
1438,"Not yet, nohow."
1439,But he's just about to buy who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.
1440,"""Thank you, Stephen."" You're welcome, Calvin."
1441,Where you gettin' all this?
1442,"Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300?"
1443,They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.
1444,She probably his wife.
1445,"Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know."
1446,If she's who they want...
1447,"...why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then?"
1448,You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.
1449,"But that 12,000? That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?"
1450,"Yes, it did."
1451,"His wife, huh?"
1452,"If it had been a snake, it would have bit me."
1453,chuckles Those lying...
1454,...goddamn timewastin' sons of bitches.
1455,Sons of bitches!
1456,"...out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types."
1457,"Oh, there you are."
1458,I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.
1459,"all chuckling That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?"
1460,"Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window."
1461,Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver trying to sell a passel of ponies.
1462,"Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?"
1463," Of course, brother."
1464," Thank you, darling."
1465, Yeah. Business never sleeps.
1466, Hmmm.
1467,"Apropos, before your exit, we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda."
1468,"Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor."
1469,And we will again. In a moment.
1470,Who's your little friend?
1471,clearing throat This is Ben.
1472,He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.
1473,And I do mean a long damn time.
1474,Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
1475,...and my daddy's daddy.
1476,Till he up and keeled over one day...
1477,...Old Ben took care of me.
1478,Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces.
1479,"I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland..."
1480,...surrounded by black faces.
1481,"Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out, I only had one question:  Why don't they kill us?"
1482," laughs Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years, Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor."
1483,"Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither."
1484,But he never did.
1485,Why not?
1486,"You see, the science of phrenology is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species."
1487,"In the skull of the African here, the area associated with submissiveness is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth."
1488,sawing If you examine...
1489,...this piece of skull here...
1490,...you will notice three distinct dimples.
1491,"Here, here and here."
1492,Now...
1493,"...if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo, these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull most associated with... creativity."
1494,But this is the skull of Old Ben.
1495,"And in the skull of Old Ben, unburdened by genius, these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with..."
1496,...servility.
1497,"Now, Bright Boy..."
1498,...I will admit you are pretty clever.
1499,But if I took this hammer here...
1500,...and I bashed in your skull with it...
1501,...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...
1502,...as Old Ben.
1503,Hey! Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
1504,"If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop, Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawedoff."
1505,"There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight, but that you can believe!"
1506,"Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol hanging off these boys' hips here?"
1507, Thank you ever so much.
1508, Doctor.
1509,Where were we?
1510,Jackass.
1511,"Ah, yes."
1512,I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
1513,Am I right?
1514,Right.
1515,Bring out Hildi!
1516,Get over there yonder.
1517, screams  Sit your ass in that goddamn...
1518,Stephen Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
1519,Calvin Now shut your mouth!
1520,"Dr. Schultz, in Greenville, you yourself said that for the right nigger you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount."
1521,"To which me myself said, ""What is your definition of ridiculous?"" To which you said, ""$12,000.""  yells  Now, considering y'all have ridden a whole lot of miles, went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull to purchase this lovely lady right here, it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact... the right nigger."
1522,"And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is $12,000."
1523,"And I take it you prefer the ""take it or leave it"" style of negotiation?"
1524,"Yes, I do, doctor."
1525,"You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda here is my property."
1526,And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire!
1527,And if y'all think my price...
1528,...for this nigger here is too steep...
1529, grunts  ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...
1530,...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!
1531, Right in front of both y'all!
1532," Easy, big fella."
1533,Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!
1534,"Now, what's it gonna be, doc?"
1535,Huh?
1536, Hildi whimpering  What's it gonna be?
1537,May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?
1538,"Yes, you may."
1539,That 12.
1540, Sold!
1541, screaming To the man with the exceptional beard and his unexceptional nigger.
1542, Mr. Moguy.
1543," Yes, Calvin?"
1544,"Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?"
1545,"$12,000."
1546,It was a pleasure doing business with y'all.
1547,"Now, gentlemen..."
1548,...if you care to join me in the parlor...
1549,...we will be serving white cake.
1550,"Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"" played on harp  screaming  dogs snarling screaming Well done, Calvin."
1551,Excuse me.
1552,"Excuse me, ma'am?"
1553,Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
1554,Take your hands off the harp!
1555,Stephen Doctor!
1556," Doctor, you can't go in there!"
1557," Stephen, Stephen."
1558,He ain't got no business going in there.
1559,Let it be.
1560,"He's just a little upset, that's all."
1561,I'll handle this.
1562,White cake?
1563,"I don't go in for sweets, thank you."
1564,Hm.
1565,"Calvin chuckles softly You brooding about me getting the best of you, huh?"
1566,"Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today."
1567,D'Artagnan.
1568,And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.
1569,Come again?
1570,Alexandre Dumas.
1571,He wrote The Three Musketeers.
1572,"Yes, of course, doctor."
1573,I figured you must be an admirer.
1574,You named your slave after his novel's lead character.
1575,"Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would have made of it."
1576,"You doubt he'd approve, huh?"
1577,Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
1578,Softhearted Frenchie.
1579,Alexandre Dumas is black.
1580, Are these Broomhilda's papers?
1581," Yes, they are."
1582, May I?
1583, Of course.
1584,Thank you.
1585,"That is her bill of sale, her ownership history, and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor."
1586,Would you have ink and pen for me?
1587, Right over there on that little table.
1588, Thank you.
1589,Thank you.
1590,Broomhilda Von Shaft...
1591,...consider yourself a free woman.
1592,Mr. Candie...
1593,"...normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen."
1594,"But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is ""till I see you again"" and since I never wish to see you again, to you, sir... I say, ""goodbye."" Let's go."
1595,Come on.
1596,"One more moment, doctor!"
1597,What?
1598,It's a custom here in the South...
1599,...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.
1600,It implies good faith.
1601, I'm not from the South.
1602, But you are...
1603,"...in my house, doctor."
1604, So I'm afraid I must insist.
1605, Insist?
1606,On what?
1607,That I shake your hand?
1608,"Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction."
1609, You know what I think you are?
1610, What you think I am?
1611,"No, I don't."
1612, I think you are a bad loser.
1613, And I think you're an abysmal winner.
1614,"Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done until the two parties have shook hands."
1615,"Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit..."
1616,...you don't shake my hand.
1617,"If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000?"
1618,I don't think so.
1619,Mr. Pooch?
1620,"If she tries to leave here before this niggerloving German shakes my hand, you cut her ass down."
1621,cocking shotgun You really want me to shake your hand?
1622,I insist.
1623,If you insist.

1687,I got to say...
1688,...I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.
1689,Black boy paid to kill white men?
1690,How'd you like that line of work?

1707,"Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts."
1708,"Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is..."
1709,"...when you snip a nigger's nuts, most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm... seven minutes."
1710,Most of 'em.
1711,"chuckles Well, more than most."
1712,"Then I says: ""Shitfire."
1713,"The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."" And they still sayin', ""Let's whip him to death."" Or ""Throw him to the Mandingos."" ""Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."" And I said, ""What's so special about that?"
1714,We do that shit all the time.
1715,"Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."" Lo and behold, out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company."
1716,"And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, henceforth, till the day you die, all day, every day, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, turning big rocks into little rocks."
1717,"Now, when you get there, they gonna take away your name, give you a number and a sledgehammer, and say, ""Get to work!"" One word of sass, they cuts out your tongue."
1718,And they good at it too.

1720,"Oh, they does that real good."
1721,They gonna work ya.
1722,"All day, every day, till your back give out."
1723,"Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer, throw your ass down the nigger hole."
1724,"And that will be the story of you, Django."
1725,"slowtempo song plays man, Australian accent And what's the golden rule, Frankie, eh?"
1726,You don't root abos.
1727,"Hey, white boy."
1728,"I said, hey, white boy."
1729,"Shut up, black. You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear."
1730,"How'd you like to make $11,000?"
1731,"Do what, now?"
1732,"I said how'd you like to make $11,000?"
1733,What the fuck are you talking about?
1734,"Back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune, just sittin' there."
1735,And y'all rode right past it.
1736,"You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits."
1737,I ain't saying that. Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
1738,You can't steal it.
1739,"You got to earn it, white boy."
1740,"You got something to say, mate, you say it."
1741,"The $11,500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland is in the form of a ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang."
1742,Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
1743,"Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang."
1744,"There's a $7,000 ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" bounty on him, $1,500 for each of his three accomplices: Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons."
1745,"Now, all four of them gentlemen, they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off."
1746,You know why?
1747,'Cause they just got away with murder.
1748,But it ain't got to be that way.
1749,"You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money."
1750,What'd these jokers do again?
1751,"These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people."
1752,Stagecoach robbery.
1753,Innocent white people.
1754,"I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it."
1755,Get it out.
1756,"man 1 ""Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.""  man 2 But you're a slave."
1757," man 1 ""For murder...""  Django I ain't no goddamn slave."
1758," man 1 ""...and stagecoach robbery."" Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?"
1759," man 1 ""$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.""  Hm?"
1760, man 2 That's a shitload.
1761, I'm a bounty hunter.
1762,"Yesterday, as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner, Dr. King Schultz."
1763,We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County.
1764,We finally found their ass layin' low in Candyland.
1765,"We went in there to get 'em, things went sour, my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot, then everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am."
1766,But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
1767,And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
1768,"But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted, and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it."
1769,man 1 What's the deal?
1770,You tell us who they are and we turn you loose?
1771,"No,no,no,no."
1772,I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
1773,"But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses, and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point 'em out to you."
1774,This is a real handbill.
1775,Now just 'cause it's a real handbill doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
1776,"Now why would a slave have a ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" handbill in his pocket?"
1777,Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?
1778,"All right, I'm gonna ask you again."
1779,"I want you to remember, I don't like liars."
1780,"Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?"
1781,"Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville auction, and he rode in on a horse with a white man."
1782,"Now this white man, was the black his slave?"
1783,He weren't no slave.
1784, You fuckin' sure about that?
1785, Damn sure.
1786, What happened over in Candyland?
1787, Buncha shootin'.
1788,Massa got shot.
1789, Who shot him?
1790, The German.
1791,Why'd he do that?
1792,Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't.
1793," Well, what were they?"
1794, Bounty hunters.
1795,"Fuck me, Roy."
1796,"I mean, this could be big, mate."
1797,"Well, smoke, you got a deal."
1798, I got one more condition.
1799, What's that?
1800,"When we get there, when time come..."
1801, ...you let me help you kill 'em.
1802, Hey... laughs ...you're a funny bugger.
1803, Cut him loose.
1804," Yeah, yeah."
1805,"You got yourself a deal, blackie."
1806,"mimics accent You got yourself a deal, mate."
1807,Hey! laughs You're all right for a black fella.
1808,"Oh, yeah."

1810,"There you go, mate."
1811,Yeah.
1812,We're gonna give you that packhorse over there.
1813,What them saddlebags got in 'em?
1814, Dynamite.
1815, No. I ain't ridin' no horse with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
1816,I can understand that.
1817,"Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse and stick 'em in the nigger cage."
1818,A little dynamite for you black fellas to play with.
1819,"laughs Now, Floyd, you got that rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?"
1820,"Yeah, right."
1821,Why don't you give him your gun and gun belt?
1822,Righto.
1823,"Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing, all right?"
1824,I've just had the sights fixed and they're perfect.
