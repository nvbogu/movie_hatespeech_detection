139, Uncover him.
140, It isn't safe.
141,Do it.
142,"Hello, Theo."

145,The police have been a pain in the ass lately.
146,How have you been?
147,Fantastic. Couldn't be better.
148,Cut the lights.
149,The police keep using that old photo of you in the posters.
150,It doesn't do you justice.
151,What do the police know about justice?
152,"What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?"
153,The Fishes fight for equal rights for every immigrant in Britain!
154,He knows what we do.
155,I know you almost blew me up in a coffee shop yesterday.
156,My ears are still ringing.
157, We don't bomb.
158, That was the government.
159,That's what they do to spread the fear.
160,What about Liverpool?
161,"After Liverpool,we stopped bombing."
162,We started speaking to the people.
163,"And they're joining us, Theo. British people, too."
164,I don't talk politics. That's all you ever used to do.
165, That was 20 years ago.
166,I'm a lot more successful now.
167,"Come on, Theo. Walk with me."
168, I don't think that's a good idea.
169, Come on!
170, You're smoking?
171, Yeah. It's not working.
172,I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.
173,Were your parents in New York when it happened?
174, Yeah.
175, Shit.
176,"Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now, isn't it?"
177,"Why am I here, Jules?"
178,I need your help. I need transit papers.
179,"Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee."
180,"Need to get her to the coast, past security checkpoints."
181,I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years and you come asking me for transit papers?
182, Can you do it?
183, I don't see how.
184,You could ask your cousin.
185,The government finances his Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.
186," Yeah, but he'd never do it. He would if you asked him."
187,I can't.It's too dangerous.
188,"I can get you £5,000."
189,I know you need the money.
190,What are you talking about?
191, I don't fucking need your money.
192, Right. Sorry.
193,My mistake.
194,You know that ringing in your ears? That...
195,That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
196,Like their swan song.
197,"Once it's gone,you'll never hear that frequency again. Enjoy it while it lasts."
198,"This never fucking happened,so don't go telling tales,'cause we'll be watching you."
199,"At work, when you sleep, when you have a piss, we'll be watching."
200,All the fucking time.
201,"Jeez, your breath stinks."
202," No, it doesn't."
203," Yes, it does."
204,It was Julian's idea bringing you here.
205,She put herself at great risk.
206,Now you know about the five grand we can offer you.
207,"So if you change your mind, pin this to the notice board at Camden tube."
208,We'll do the rest.
209,Here you are. Bus fare.
210,Earthquakes! Pollution!
211,Disease and famine!
212,Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!
213,And in his anger he has taken away his most precious gift to us!
214,"Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you."
215,"This way, sir."
216,I'm afraid this is a nonsmoking facility.
217,You got something in your teeth.
218,If you'll excuse me.
219,Couldn't save La Pietà.
220,Smashed up before we got there.
221,"Pretty rummy, huh?"
222,My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.
223,It was a lamp.
224,"Good to see you, Theo."
225,"We got to keep Las Meninas and a few other Velásquezes, but we only got a hold of two Goyas."
226,That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.
227,Not to mention people.
228,How's Martha?
229,She's doing her animal charity thing.
230,Sends her love.
231, Give her my best.
232, Yes.
233,"Why did you come, Theo?"
234,"Well, the thing is, I met this girl."
235,Cute?
236,Beautiful.
237,Is it serious?
238,Very.
239,"She's got this brother in Brighton and she hasn't seen him for about five years, and he's not doing too good."
240,"I mean, pretty sick."
241, I don't think he's gonna make it.
242, Sorry.
243,I've got money.
244,I was just hoping that you might...
245,I was hoping you could get us the transit papers to get to the coast.
246, Transit papers? That's quite a favor.
247, I know.
248,Highly controlled.
249,"Alex, take your pills."
250,Alex.
251,Alex?
252,Alex!
253,Come with me.
254,"I'm really sorry, Nigel."
255,I just don't know who else to ask.
256,I'll see what I can do.
257,What?
258,You kill me.
259,"A hundred years from now, there won't be one sad fuck to look at any of this."
260,What keeps you going?
261,"You know what it is, Theo?"
262,I just don't think about it.
263, Where's Julian?
264, She couldn't make it. Sends her best.
265,Here's a photo of the girl and her name.
266,Hang on. We got a problem.
267,"All I could get were joint transit papers, which means I would have to escort the girl."
268,Will you?
269,For a couple more grand.
270,Julian thinks very highly of you.
271,Does she?
272,Yeah.
273,Thanks again.
274,"Go on, stay with her."
275,Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!
276,Have you seen this dog?
277,I'll be one minute.
278,"Billy! I'm in a rush, mate."
279,"Okay, Theo. He'll see to you."
280,He'll see to you.
281,I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on.
282,That's 70 quid.
283,Shit.
284, She's my house cleaner.
285, He's the plumber.
286,Jesus.
287, He's my dentist.
288, He's the waiter.She's my cousin.
289,They are illegal immigrants.
290,"To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime."
291,Protect Britain.
292,Report all illegal immigrants.
293,Did you get the papers?
294,"Lovely to see you, too."
295,Thank you. I really appreciate this.
296,"Just like the old days, back of the bus."
297,"Yeah, except we're the old farts now."
298, You're looking good.
299, Right. Seriously. Look at me.
300,It's hard for me to look at you.
301,He had your eyes.
302,"You know, I never understood how you got over it so quickly.You think I got over it?"
303,No one could get over it.
304,I live with it. I think about him every day.
305,"Come on, I mean the way you just..."
306,"You don't have a monopoly on suffering, you know."
307,You always carried his memory like a ball and chain...
308,What do you fucking know about my memories?
309, You don't know what I feel or what...
310," Move!Yeah, there you go."
311,That's what you always do.
312,"When it gets tough, you walk away."
313,This is our stop.
314,Thelonius!
315,So why did you come to me?
316,You could have found other ways to get transit papers.
317,Probably.
318, So why me?
319, I trust you.
320, And what happens after?
321, You take a train back. It'll be safer.
322,"No, I mean what happens to us?"
323,I don't know.
324,"Theo, come on. You came for the money."
325,Did I?
326,Theo?
327, You got my money?
328, See?
329,"We'll take you down to the first checkpoint on the Canterbury Road, then you and Kee are on your own."
330,"Well, this is obviously the elite unit."
331, This is Miriam. Hi.
332, Is this the girl?
333," Kee, this is Theo."
334,What the fuck you staring at?
335,Apparently the pleasure's all mine.
336,Are we planning a singalong?
337,Good. I'm gonna take a nap.
338,The afternoon is looking good here on Radio Avalon.
339,"And now one for all the nostalgics out there, a blast from the past all the way back from 2003."
340,That beautiful time when people refused to accept the future was just around the corner.
341,Hey.
342,You're snoring.
343," No, I wasn't."
344," Yes, you were. He always snored."
345,Where are we?
346,Canterbury. We're close.
347,Anyone know if there's a hotel around here?
348,What?
349,Julian promised me a little bit of action.
350,You still like it in the afternoon?
351,So what did you do? Rob a train?
352,Blow up a building?
353,Leave the girl alone.
354,You told me he was suave.
355,Wanker's a drunk.
356,He's suave. You should have seen him in the old days when he was a real activist.
357,"You were the activist, I just wanted to get laid."
358,"One time the police came to throw us out of our squat and Theo invited them up for coffee to negotiate, only the coffee was spiked with ketamine."
359,"No! You didn't, did you?"
360,Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.
361,You know how many people I've tried this with?
362,I don't wanna know.
363,You'll be happy to know out of the hundreds...
364, Hundreds?
365, ... you are still the only one.
366, I'm not doing it.
367," Yes, you are."
368," No, I'm not. The car's moving too much."
369," Yes, you are. Yes, you are.You are. Ready?"
370,Thelonius!
371,"No, wait, wait. Okay."
372,Do it again! Do it again!
373,"Julian, that's disgusting!"
374,Look out!
375,Jesus! Shit!
376,Go! Go! We're gonna make it.
377,"Come on, we're gonna make it."
378,"No, I'm not gonna make it!"
379,I'm not gonna make it!

390, How is she? How is she?
391, She's bleeding!
392,"She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!"
393,Shit! Julian.
394,Put pressure on the wound!
395,"Please, please, please."
396,"Please, please."
397,"Oh, no."
398,"Oh, no."
399,Julian...
400,Jesus Christ!
401,Julian!
402,It's the cops. It's the cops.
403,Did they see us?
404,Keep going. Speed up.
405,Are they coming back?
406,What's happening?
407,Faster! Faster! Are they coming back?
408, I don't know. Just go faster!
409,Can't you pull off the road?
410," All right, slow down. Slow down!"
411, I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.
412, Stop the car.
413, I gotta stop. I gotta stop.
414,Pull over to the side of the road.
415,Stop the car!
416,Get your passports out!
417,Stay inside the vehicle!
418,We're British citizens!
419,We're British citizens!
420, British citizens!
421, Hands on the steering wheel!
422,Hands on the steering wheel!
423,Calm down. Tell me what happened!
424,We were attacked!
425,We gotta take her to a hospital.
426,Okay. Just wait.
427,I'm gonna call for assistance.
428,What are you doing? What are you doing?
429, Get in the car.
430, Why did you do that?
431,Get in the fucking car!
432,Get back in now. Quickly.
433,We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.
434,Go! Go! Go!
435,We have to call on help now.

437,"Fucking shit.May all the ascended beings, the bodhisattvas and saints and all those who have walked the surface of the earth in the light of eternal truth, come to the aid of our beloved sister, Julian."
438,Theo! Come on!
439,"Theo, come on!"
440,This is Tomasz and Emily's farm.
441,I already called and told them the situation.
442,We'll be safe here.
443,Fishes are coming in to vote for a new leader.
444, Ian?
445, Yeah.
446, We have to convene.
447, Everyone's arriving.
448, Are you all right?
449," Yeah, it's not my blood."
450," Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee."
451, Welcome.
452,Miriam.
453,They need to wash up and rest.
454,How about Julian's mate?
455,"Yeah, can somebody give me a lift back to London?"
456,"No, no, no. It's too dangerous."
457,We'll sort it tomorrow.
458,"Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt."
459,"Tomasz, don't block the car in."
460,It needs to be jumpstarted. Ian? Yeah.
461,They like you. And they don't like anyone.
462, You did what you could.
463, We need to show strength and unity.
464," The shirt fit? Yeah, it's fine. Thanks."
465,I'll take care of this.
466,"As head Fishes,we need to make a choice now."
467,We need to choose leadership.
468,I don't think that those bloodstains will wash off.
469,Don't worry about it. Throw it away.
470, I'm in charge of watching you.
471, Why?
472,They told me.
473,"Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow."
474,I lived there once. Didn't like it.
475,No.
476,They kill you.
477,Where you from? Poland.
478,Is this your place?
479,My missus. She's a cod.
480, English Fish.
481, Mr. Faron.
482,Kee would like a word with you.
483,"She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz."

485,"Hey, don't smoke in the barn."
486,"To Luke, our new leader. Luke."
487, To Luke.
488, Luke.
489,I'll be right outside.
490,You know what they do to these cows?
491,They cut off their tits. They do.
492,Gone. Bye.
493,Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.
494,It's wacko. Why not make machines that suck eight titties?
495,Is that what you want to talk about?
496,Cows and titties? Julian told me about your baby.
497,Said his name was Dylan.
498,You taught him to swim when he was two.
499,"He called you ""Papa. "" She said if anything goes spooky, I should talk to you."
500,"Said you'd help me, said you'd get me to the boat."
501, What boat? The Tomorrow.
502,The Tomorrow?
503,I don't know what you're talking about.
504,But I'm sure your friends can take care of you.
505,But Julian said only trust you.
506,She said you'd help me.
507,I don't know why she said that.
508,"Listen, I don't quite know what's going on."
509, You can't leave.
510," Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself."
511, I'm sorry.
512, Wait!
513,What are you doing? Don't do that.
514,I'm scared.
515,Please help me.
516,Jesus Christ.
517, Kee! Kee!
518, What are you doing?
519, Are you all right?
520, She wanted him to know. She has the right.
521,Of course she has.
522,For God's sake.
523,"When you're ready, come inside."
524,Everybody's arrived.
525, She's pregnant.
526, Now you know what's at stake.
527, But she's pregnant.
528," Yeah, I know."
529,"It's a miracle, isn't it?"
530,Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor was killed today in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.
531,Four other terrorists escaped after murdering two officers.
532,Police say they have sufficient forensic and surveillance evidence to identify the four killers.
533,All suspects should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
534,This was broadcast an hour ago.
535,"We have to assume it's just a matter of time before they identify the rest of us, which includes you, Theo. Why is he here?"
536, He's not a Fish.
537, He's not one of us. I want him here.
538,"Kee wants him, he stays."
539,"Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our brothers and sisters in the Human Project."
540, Right.
541, Now we got to reevaluate that position.
542,"No, there's no need."
543,We move forward with the original plan.
544,Yes!
545,She'll never make it.
546,The police are looking for her.
547,We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.
548,We'd be risking the girl's life.
549,"Listen, listen! She belongs here."
550,And this baby is the flag that could unite us all!
551,We said we'd never use this baby for political purposes.
552,My baby's not a flag.
553,Make it public!
554,What?
555, What?
556, What?
557,Excuse me?
558,You should make it public.
559,You saw the telly.
560,She's about to be very public.
561,It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.
562,"Oh, right. And then the government will say, ""We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too. "" Well, whatever is going on, whatever your political ideas are, it's irrelevant."
563, It doesn't matter.
564, Come on.
565, She needs a doctor.
566, You really don't get it.
567,"Look, the government will take her baby and parade a posh black English lady as the mother."
568, And she'll never see it again.
569, Nobody's taking my baby!
570,We all know this government would never acknowledge the first human birth in 18 years from a fugee.
571,A wanted fugee.
572,Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron what they do to immigrants in this country?
573,He knows. He's seen the cages.He's not that stupid.
574,I'm not going to the government.
575,You told me you would get me to the Human Project.
576, You promised me.
577, I know.
578,And we will.
579,But I don't think it's safe to try and reach the coast now.
580,"You could stay here, Kee."
581,It's a safe place for you to have your child.
582,"And when you and the baby are well enough, we will find a way to get you to the Human Project."
583,"I promise you, Kee."
584,It could take months to get back in touch with them again.
585,"This is true.We have to take it under consideration. Kee, this is your decision."
586,What do you think?
587, I think you need proper care.
588," Oh, brilliant!She has proper care!"
589, What the fuck does he know?
590, Hang on. Kee?
591,"Kee, this is your choice."
592, I have my baby here...
593, Yes!
594,...then you get me to the Human Project.
595,"Thank you, Kee. Thank you."
596,We need to organize safe houses.
597,No more than three days in one place.
598,"No, no, you can't keep moving her around."
599,It's for her safety.
600, Please help him!
601, What are you doing?
602, He's hurt really badly!
603," Oh, shit, fuck."
604, I didn't have anywhere else to go.
605, You're not supposed to be here!
606,There's fucking police everywhere!
607, What do you think you're doing?
608, He's been bleeding for hours!
609,Shut up! Get his bike out of here.
610,Get it out!
611,What was I supposed to do?
612,It's a simple fucking plan.
613,"Get in here,Patric!"
614,What the fuck are you doing here?
615,What the fuck are you doing here?
616,No fucking excuses!
617, You have a first aid kit? Medicine?
618, Mostly for cows.
619,"lodine, bandages, clean towels, whatever you have, bring it to the barn."
620,"And for God's sake, hide the fucking motorcycle."
621, You put everything at risk.
622, What was I supposed to do?
623,"What about all the fucking police, Ian?"
624,You said it would be safe!
625,We paid the gang.
626,We had no idea about the cops.
627,You broke the protocol.What were you thinking?
628,What was I thinking?
629,You could be responsible for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.
630,He needs a proper doctor!
631,Don't you get it?
632,"We have a baby.When people see we have a baby, everyone will join us in the Uprising."
633,But we can forget about the baby if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!
634,What was I supposed to do?
635,You saw how he is.
636,He's on death's fucking door!
637, Take it easy.
638, You broke protocol.
639,He's my fucking cousin!
640,"Luke, he needs a doctor."
641,Don't worry. We'll take care of him.
642,"Simon, right?"
643," Aye, Simon."
644," All right, sit down, Patric."
645,Simon is a good Fish. So are you.
646,"Be proud to know that because of the two of you, the Uprising is assured."
647,The baby will stay with us.
648,Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.
649,"No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then, after we move the girl."
650,"Patric, you ever break protocol again, I'll have to kill you."
651,"Kee. Kee, it's Theo."
652, Listen to me.
653, What's going on?
654,Luke killed Julian.
655,They want your baby. They killed Julian.
656,They're gonna...
657,They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.
658,We have to leave. We have to go now.
659,"Miriam, shut up!"
660,"Trust me, we've got to go."
661,Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!
662,Get off!
663,I'm going with him.
664,"Miriam, you can stay if you want."
665,"Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut."
666, I mean it. All right.All right.
667,We're moving the girl to Bristol straight away.
668,We need to bring weapons over...
669,The refugee camps...
670,"Zaphyr, he looks bloody fucking awful."
671,Yeah. Really?
672,"All that dirt and sand in there, nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin."
673,Shit! It's fucking disgusting.
674,He's not gonna make it.
675,"Of course not gonna make it, with all the blood and guts coming out."
676,"Hey, Samir."
677,Shit.
678,Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!
679,Don't shoot!
680,Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!
681, Stop!
682, The girl's in the car!
683,Stop the fucking car!Give me the fucking keys.
684,Give me the fucking keys.
685,Get down! Get down!
686,Can't you get it moving any faster?
687,For God's sake! Come on. Come on.
688,Stop!
689,Shit.
690,They're coming! They're coming!
691,"Get going, get going!"
692,They're getting closer!
693,"Oh, God! He's gaining on us!"
694,Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!
695,Fuck off!
696,"Miriam, jumpstart the car!"
697,We have to go!
698,Wait till it gets faster!
699,"All right! All right! Just push, you push!"
700,Fucking hell!
701,Miriam! Miriam!
702,We have to wait for him! Theo!
703,"Go, go, go!"
704," Kee, are you all right?  I'm fine."
705,We need to find a safe house.
706,"Yeah, the last one was really fucking safe."
707,"Well, what do you suggest?"
708,Don't worry. I know where to go.
709,Wait here.
710,"Oh, fuck."
711,Fuck.
712,Jasper?
713,Janice?
714,Jasper?
715," Oh, fuck!"
716," Oh, fuck you."
717,What are you doing with this shit?
718,This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.
719,It's not bullshit what they say.
720,They pass away quite peacefully.
721,Jasper.
722,Meet Miriam and Kee.
723,The Tomorrow is a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat.
724,They'll take us to the Human Project.
725,"I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real."
726,"Yeah, but you're also the guy that believes in UFOs."
727,Tell them about that thing you saw on the heath.You saw a UFO?
728,Did you know that the Human Project is supposed to have a community on the Azores?
729,"It's a sanctuary.That's where they'll take us, Kee. Can you catch this ship anywhere else?"
730,It's going to stop at the last two weather buoys en route at sunset.
731,So it will be tonight at Windsmore and then two night's time at Bexhill.
732,You can forget about Windsmore.
733,We'd never make it in time.
734,"No, it's our only chance."
735,We can't get to Bexhill.
736,That's a refugee camp.
737,Eureka! Eat and rest.
738,"With a little bit of luck, you're going to need all your energy."
739, Where are you going?
740," Feed her for me, Theo."
741,"Kee, your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for."
742,Come on. Come on.
743,Did he really see a UFO?
744,Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?
745,She's doing something.
746,She smited me with that.
747,Said it was good for my baby.
748,"Does she look posh to you, or gawky?"
749,Earnest.
750,Yeah.
751, How many months?
752, Eight.
753,It takes nine months.
754,I know.
755,Who's the father?
756,Whiffet. I'm a virgin.
757,Sorry?
758,"That'd be wicked, eh?"
759,"Yeah, it would."
760,Fuck knows.
761,I don't know most of the wankers' names.
762,"You know, when I started puking, I thought I catch the pest."
763,But then my belly started getting big.
764,Nobody ever told me these things.
765,I never seen a pregnant woman before.
766,But I knew.
767,I felt like a freak.
768,I didn't tell nobody.
769,I thought about the Quietus thing.
770,Supposed to be suave.
771,Pretty music and all that.
772,Then the baby kicked.
773,I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
774,"And I feel it. And me, too."
775,I am alive.
776, Froley.
777, Froley.
778,Name my baby Froley.
779,It's the first baby in 18 years.
780, You can't call it Froley.
781, Says who?
782,"Kee, I've found you a boat."
783, Great.
784, How?
785,We get ourselves arrested.
786," Oh, Jesus."
787," No, no."
788,"Syd, this border guard I sell pot to, has agreed to get us into Bexhill."
789,"Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison!"
790,Wicked.
791,"""Froley. "" Come on."
792,Everything is a mythical cosmic battle between faith and chance.
793, Maybe I shouldn't.
794, You already did. Take another one.
795,Now cough.
796, What do you taste?
797, Strawberries.
798,Strawberries? That's what it's called.
799,Strawberry Cough.
800,Wicked.
801,"So, you've got faith over here, right, and chance over there."
802, Like yin and yang.
803, Sort of.
804,Or Shiva and Shakti.
805,Lennon and McCartney.
806,"Look, Julian and Theo."
807,"Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met among a million protestors in a rally by chance."
808,"But they were there because of what they believed in in the first place, their faith."
809,They wanted to change the world.
810,And their faith kept them together.
811,"But by chance, Dylan was born."
812,This is him?
813,"Yeah, that's him. He would have been about your age. Magical child."
814,Beautiful.
815, Their faith put in praxis.
816, Praxis?
817, What happened?
818, Chance.
819,He was their sweet little dream.
820,"He had little hands, little legs, little feet."
821,Little lungs.
822,"And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic."
823,"And then, by chance,  he was gone."
824," Oh, Jesus."
825,"You see, Theo's faith lost out to chance."
826,"So, why bother if life's going to make its own choices?"
827, Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
828, Yeah.
829,"Oh, boy. That's terrible."
830,"But, you know, everything happens for a reason."
831,That I don't know.
832,But Theo and Julian would always bring Dylan. He loved it here.
833,It's the alarm! Someone's breaking in!
834,What is it?
835,Look at this.
836,Shit.
837,"Jasper, hurry up!"
838,Where's Janice?
839,"Take the back path to the main road, then follow the map I've given Miriam."
840," Yeah, I've got it."
841, What are you talking about?
842,Wait for Syd at the old school on Watchbell Road in Rye.
843,"Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig."
844, We need to get Janice.
845," We're not going, Theo."
846, What are you talking about?
847, You don't need an anchor.
848," No, Jasper. You're coming."
849, You need time. We'll stall them.
850,I'll send them the wrong way.
851,It's the best idea. Go on. Go on. Jasper.
852,"Theo, I've talked my way out of worse things than this. Believe me."
853,Go on. Go.
854,"And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig."
855,I love you.
856,"Hey, amigos!"
857,We're looking for Theo Faron.
858,We know he was here a few weeks ago.
859,Has he been back?
860, Who?
861, Theo Faron.
862,I haven't seen him in weeks.
863,There's biscuits and coffee on inside!
864,Help yourself.
865,You want a drag?
866,"Come on, have a drag. Lighten up."
867, What we got?
868," Here, Luke."
869,There's a dead woman and dog inside.
870,They're going to Bexhill.
871,When did they leave?
872,When did they leave?
873,"Pull my finger, go on."
874,Pull my finger.
875,I'll do it.
876,Fuck you.
877,Pull my finger.
878," Theo, I'm so sorry."
879, Don't you fucking touch me.
880,You tell me the fucking reason in that.
881, It's all part of a bigger thing. Shut up!
882,Shut up and get in the fucking car.
883, Jasper?
884, He's fine.
885,Everything's fine.
886,I was 31.
887,Midwife at the John Radcliffe.
888,I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.
889,Three of my patients miscarried in one week.
890,Others were in their fifth and sixth month.
891,We managed to save two of the poor babies.
892,"Next week, five more miscarried."
893,Then the miscarriages started happening earlier.
894,I remember booking a woman in for her next appointment and noticing that the page seven months ahead was completely blank.
895,Not a single name.
896,"I rang a friend who was working at Queen Charlotte's, and she had no new pregnancies, either."
897,She then rang her sister in Sydney.
898,And it was the same thing there.
899,You can relax. She's finished.
900,"As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in."
901,Very odd what happens in a world without children's voices.
902,I was there at the end.
903,Now you're gonna be there at the beginning.
904,Yeah.
905,I'll be there at the beginning.
906,Thank you.
907,"Kee, come on! We've got to go!"
908,Stop where you are.
909,I'm looking for Syd.
910,Hands above your head.
911,You're a fascist pig.
912,What did you say?
913,I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.
914, Say it again.
915," No, don't, please!"
916,Say it again.
917,Say it!
918,You're a fascist pig.
919,Come on.
920,"It was Jasper's idea, you know."
921,The whole password thing.
922,He will piss himself laughing when I tell him about this.
923,He's a cheeky old bastard.
924,So proud of his weed.
925,"Syd could get it a lot cheaper from the gangs, but Syd likes to deal with Jasper."
926,Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.
927, All right. What's wrong with her?
928,Is she sick? Just carsick.
929," She's not going to puke, is she?"
930, No. She's fine.
931,"Puking's bad. Very, very bad."
932,It doesn't wash out.
933,The smell never goes away.
934,"Usually, there's people trying to get out of Bexhill, not in."
935,Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.
936,Syd doesn't want to know.
937,Syd doesn't care.
938,Just breathe. Just breathe.
939,What's wrong with her? A minor contraction.
940,It's normal. Just breathe.
941,All right.
942,"When you're released,stroll out with the other fugees. Look for the statue of a soldier."
943,"There you'll meet a woman, Marichka."
944,"Arab, gypsy, something."
945,Always carries a shitty little dog with her.
946,She'll find you accommodation for tonight.
947,All right. You're fugees now.
948,Show Syd the fugee face.
949,Sad face.
950,Sad fugee face.
951,That's good. That's good.
952,Okay. Out!
953,Come on. Come on. Come on.
954,"Hurry up. Hurry up, move."
955,Send me a postcard.Seats in the back!
956,"Come on, hurry up!"
957,What time are we supposed to meet the boat?
958,Sunset tomorrow.
959,How do we know that Luke and his mob haven't intercepted it?
960,Luke has no way of contacting the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.
961,Say again?
962,Contact with the Human Project is done by mirrors. Julian was our mirror.
963,"What do you mean, ""mirrors""?"
964,Mirrors. They contact one of our people.
965,"That person contacts someone else,and so on, till word gets to Julian.She tells Luke."
966,You mean you never actually talked to any of them?
967,Don't fucking tell me you never actually talked to them?
968, Breathe it out. Is she okay?
969,"That's it. Breathe it out, breathe it out."
970,I can't fucking breathe.
971,You sure this is normal?
972,It shouldn't be this frequent.
973,"Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right."
974,"Miriam, I'm all wet."
975,Her water's broke. The baby's coming.
976,Shit. Shit!
977,"All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart."
978,Everything is fine. Breathe.
979,Just breathe it out. That's it.
980,Tomorrow you'll be safe.You'll be on the boat.
981,"On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you."
982,They'll take you far away from all this.
983,"Look up, you piece of shite. Look up."
984,Out!
985,Get out!
986,"Lord, give Kee the strength to know that she has the power already within her."
987, She has the wisdom...
988, What's wrong with you?
989,"I said, what's wrong with you?"
990,"Look at me! I said, what's wrong with you?"
991," Saint Gabriel, help us..."
992, Shut up!
993," You! Out! Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!"
994,"Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!"
995," Up, now. Come on."
996, Caca! Caca!
997,Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.
998,You smell it yourself.
999,You fucking people disgust me.
1000,"She's okay, Kee. She's okay."
1001, She's gonna be...
1002, Miriam!
1003,Move it! Come along now!
1004,"Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!"
1005,Get down there. Down there. Move.
1006,Follow the line!
1007, Theo!
1008, Kee!
1009, Take it off!
1010, Theo!
1011,"Come on, move! Move it! Come on!"
1012,Move it! Move it!
1013,Come on! Move! Move!
1014,Britain supports you and provides you shelter.
1015,Do not support terrorists.
1016,Britain supports you and provides you shelter.
1017,Do not support terrorists.
1018,"Hey you, buddy!"
1019,"Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!"
1020,You want accommodations? I got running water!
1021,I got... Just leave the girl alone.
1022, Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
1023, Fuck off.
1024, Who do you fucking think you are?
1025, Fuck off.
1026,Don't mind these bastards.
1027,I'll take care of you.
1028,"Come on, I've got a room, food, a place to stay. What do you need?"
1029," I'm fine, thanks. You must need something, man."
1030,"""Fuck off,"" is it? Bollocks."
1031,Marichka?
1032,"It's okay, Kee."
1033,Just breathe through it.
1034,"That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee."
1035,We're almost there.
1036,It's just a few stairs.
1037,Just hold onto me.
1038,I've got you.
1039,Just keep breathing.
1040,Marichka? How far?
1041,How far?
1042,"We're almost there, Kee. Almost there."
1043,You're doing great. Come on.
1044,You're almost there. Three more steps.
1045,"We're there, Kee. We're there."
1046,"Okay, there's a bed. Easy."
1047,Make her go! Make her go!
1048,That's great. Thank you.
1049,Get her out!
1050,Thank you.
1051,"Okay, Kee."
1052,I'm going to put my coat underneath.
1053,You'll be cleaner.
1054,You're okay.
1055,Okay?
1056,There's water.

1109, She's fine. It's a woman's thing.
1110,Fuck off!
1111,"A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole in the fence and fugees got out."
1112,"But Syd happens to know, the hole in the fence isn't about fugees getting out."
1113, It's about Fishies getting in.
1114, Go away.

1151,"And then the news came on, and you two were on it."
1152,Something about a cop killer.
1153,Something about a big reward.
