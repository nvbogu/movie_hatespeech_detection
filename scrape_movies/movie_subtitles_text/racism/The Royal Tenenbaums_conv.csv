492,Come on.
493,"So what do you think of this big, old black buck moving in up there?"
494,Who?
495,Henry Sherman.
496,You know him?
497,Yeah.
498,Is he worth a damn?
499,I believe so.
500,What happened to your finger?
501,"Uzi, shh."
502,"It's okay, I'll tell you."
503,I'm adopted. Did you know that?
504,"Well, I am."
505,"When I was 14, I went to find my real family."
506,They live in Indiana.
507,"All right, now, just set one of them hickory trunks right up top there, sister Maggie."
508,Did you try to sew it back on?
509,Wasn't worth it.
510,Hell of a damn grave.
511,Wish it were mine.
512,"It's a shame, isn't it?"
513,What?
514,"Well, you probably had another good two or three years of competitive play in you."
515,Probably.
516,"I had a lot riding on that match, you know."
517,Financially and personally.
518,"Why did you choke out there that day, Baumer?"
519,TENNIS ANNOUNCER: Mr. Gandhi leads 4015.
520,COMMENTATOR: That's 72 unforced errors for Richie Tenenbaum.
521,He's playing the worst tennis of his life.
522,"What's he feeling right now, Tex Hayward?"
523,"HAYWARD: I don't know, Jim."
524,There's obviously something wrong with him.
525,"He's taken off his shoes and one of his socks and... actually, I think he's crying."
526,COMMENTATOR: I think you're right.
527,"Who's he looking at in the friends' box, Tex?"
528,"HAYWARD: That's his sister, Margot and her new husband, Raleigh St. Clair."
529,"They were just married yesterday, Jim."
530,"COMMENTATOR: Oh, yes."
531,COMMENTATOR: I've never seen anything like this.
532,HAYWARD: Neither have I.
533,Strange day out here at Windswept Fields.
534,"I kind of disappeared after that, didn't I?"
535,Yeah.
536,But I understood.
537,I know you're not very good with disappointment.
538,"You still got that little BB in your hand, Chassie?"
539,Why did you shoot me?
540,"It was the object of the game, wasn't it?"
541,No.
542,We were on the same team.
543,Were we?
544,Well... you sued me.
545,Twice. Got me disbarred.
546,"I don't hold it against you, do I?"
547,And how is it possible for Mr. Tenenbaum to withdraw these funds without your written authorization?
548,"Objection, Your Honor."
549,"Damn it, I..."
550,"Why don't you leave the objections to me, Royal?"
551,Because I started the corporation when I was a minor.
552,"So, my father was the primary signatory on most of my accounts."
553,He also stole bonds out of my safety deposit box when I was 14.
554,You think you could start forgiving me?
555,Why should I?
556,Because you're hurting me.
557,Come on.
558,Were you in prison?
559,Kind of.
560,Minimum security.
561,I got jacked by the IRS.
562,Should we split?
563,"Yes, sir."
564,"No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum."
565,Okay.
566,"No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy."
567,Okay.
568,"Come on, let's shag ass."
569,"Well, just let me know if you need somebody to talk to, okay?"
570,I like Raleigh very much.
571,"I know he's a lot older than you are and you two are having some problems but... anyway, maybe I can help."
572,Okay. Thanks.
573,"Hey, Baumer! All right!"
574,All right! Ha!
575,"Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus."
576,"By the way, I heard about that letter you sent to Eli."
577,You dropped some cigarettes.
578,Those aren't mine.
579,They just fell out of your pocket.
580,"Oh, my Lord, look at you."
581,Come in.
582,Did you tell Margot about that letter I wrote to you?
583,Why? Did she mention it?
584,"Yes, I did."
585,"Why would she have repeated that, I wonder?"
586,"Well, I would ask you the same question."
587,Rightly so.
588,What'd you say?
589,Hmm?
590,What?
591,I didn't say anything.
592,When? Right now?
593,I'm sorry; don't listen to me.
594,I'm on mescaline.
595,I've been spaced out all day.
596,Did you say you're on mescaline?
597,"I did, indeed."
598,Very much so.
599,"How often do you, uh?"
600,"I'm worried about you, Richie."
601,Why?
602,"Well, actually, Margot is, for some reason."
603,But I did find it odd when you said you were in love with her.
604,"She's married, you know."
605,Yeah.
606,And she's your sister.
607,Adopted.
608,Where are my encyclopedias?
609,They've been placed in storage.
610,"Well, damn you."
611,You're taking my encyclopedias.
612, Ththis is humiliating.
613, I'm sorry.
614,Would you like to make a complaint in writing?
615,Where am I supposed to go?
616,You're turning me into a damn hobo.
617,I'd be happy to make a reservation for you  at another hotel.
618, You son of a bitch.
619,Frederick.
620,"Hello there, Dusty."
621,Hello.
622,Could you spot me a quarter?
623,Of course.
624,Richie? Hi.
625,It's your dad.
626,I think he's very lonely...
627,Ionelier than he lets on maybe lonelier than he even realizes.
628,Have you spoken to him about this?
629,"Briefly, and he agreed that we..."
630,"I'm sorry, maybe I'm a little confused here."
631,What are you suggesting?
632,That he come here and stay in my room.
633,Are you out of your mind?
634,"No, I'm not."
635,"Anyway, I think that he'd be much more comfortable here than he would..."
636,Who gives a shit?
637,I do.
638,You poor sucker.
639,"You poor, washedup papa's boy."
640,"SHERMAN: All right, let's not get out of hand."
641,"Please, don't get in the middle of this, Mr. Sherman."
642,This is a family matter.
643,Don't talk to him like that.
644, Call me Henry.
645, I prefer Mr. Sherman.
646,Call him Henry.
647,Why? I don't know him that well.
648,You've known him for ten years.
649,"As your accountant, Mr. Sherman, yes."
650,Where are you going to sleep?
651,I'm just going to camp out upstairs.
652,We brought our sleeping bag...
653,Uzi!
654,"ARI: We don't mind, Dad."
655,We like him.
656,"UZl: Who, Pappy?"
657,"""Pappy""?"
658,He can sleep in the room above us.
659,"Ari, it's not your decision."
660,Nor is it yours.
661,"Well, he's already up there."
662,What?!
663,I think he's asleep because of the medication he's on but I... I guess you can wake him up and throw him out...
664,if Mom says it's okay.
665,Get out.
666,All right.
667,Let me just collect my things.
668,"Would you mind handing me my cane, Richie?"
669,"Let me see, where's my suitcases?"
670,I'll get 'em.
671,"Oh, thanks."
672,: Oh!
673,Dad!
674,Mom!
675,"Grab me a Nembutal, will you, son?"
676,Are you okay?
677,What the fuck you care?
678,"ETHELINE: Oh, my goodness."
679,ROYAL: Pagoda?
680,Call Doctor McClure.
681,Take a breath and hold it.
682,Now cough.
683,His condition is stable.
684,The attack was just a side effect.
685,I recommend you push fluids and continue the stomach cancer medication.
686,CHAS: Can we move him?
687,Absolutely not.
688,For how long?
689,We'll have to wait and see.
690,Is he going to be all right?
691,That depends. Is he a fighter?
692,Yeah.
693,Then that's the best we've got.
694,"Pagoda's in possession of a parcel containing my will and some instructions for the funeral including my epitaph, for when the time comes."
695,"Proofread it for me before they carve it on the headstone, okay?"
696,Okay.
697,"I never did stop loving you, by the way."
698,Do you believe that?
699,Not really.
700,You look terrific.
701,That dress is stunning.
702,Thanks.
703,"(acoustic guitar plays soft, slow melody) âª Tears that angels cry... âª âª And the dark and all the sky... âª Lights out, old man."
704,"I thought I'd read for a while, Chas."
705,Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.
706,I'm right in the middle of a sentence.
707,"Well, you'll have to finish it in the morning."
708,Them's the rules.
709,Chas?
710,"Good night, my boy."
711,"âª When the one you love says goodbye âª âª Sing a lullaby âª âª Deedeedee, deedee, deedee âª âª Deedeedee, deedee, deedee... âª Looks like you and Dad are back together again, huh?"
712,"He's your dad, too, Chas."
713," No, he's not."
714," Yes, he is."
715,"You really hate me, don't you?"
716,No. I don't. I love you.
717,"Well, I don't know what you think you're going to get out of this but believe me, whatever it is, it's not worth it."
718,Chas...
719,I don't want to hurt you.
720,I know what you and the boys have been through.
721,"You're my brother, and I love you."
722,Stop saying that!
723,What's that jackass doing?
724,"I know you, asshole!"
725,Did Eli send you that?
726,Mmhmm.
727,He always sends me his clippings.
728,What for?
729,I think he just likes the encouragement.
730,He's done it for years.
731,He used to send me his grades in college.
732,That's ridiculous.
733,How long do you intend to stay here?
734,I don't know.
735,Are you ever coming home?
736,Maybe not.
737,You're joking.
738,No.
739,"Well, I want to die."
740,"Raleigh, please..."
741,Have you met someone else?
742,I couldn't even begin to think about knowing how to answer that question.
743,ROYAL: I don't like the way you're treating Raleigh.
744,What are you talking about?
745,You don't even know him.
746,"Well, I've met him, and I don't think he deserves..."
747,Stay out of it.
748,You're twotiming him with that bloodsucker Eli Cash.
749,"Now, that's just not right, damn it."
750,You used to be a genius.
751,"No, I didn't."
752,"Anyway, that's what they used to say."
753,"RALEIGH: Richard, I know you're terribly close to Margot and probably understand her better than anyone."
754,May I confide in you?
755,Okay.
756,I believe she's having an affair.
757,I'm utterly devastated.
758,I... don't know where else to turn.
759,Will you advise me?
760,I don't know.
761,What do you want to do?
762,I don't know.
763,"Perhaps, uh..."
764,Find the guy and get him?
765,"Well, no, I thought we could..."
766,Who do you think it might be?
767,I don't know at the moment.
768,"CHAS: Let's look at the actuals, okay?"
769,I agree with you a hundred percent.
770,That's why we have marketing grids.
771,ROYAL: Hey.
772,What do you say we go down to Little Tokyo and get some fireworks?
773,What do you need?
774,Nothing.
775,"I see you got them, uh, crunching numbers for you."
776,Please don't come in this room.
777,"Chas has those boys cooped up like a pair ofjackrabbits, Etheline."
778,He has his reasons.
779,"Oh, I know that but you can't raise boys to be scared of life."
780,You got to brew some recklessness into them.
781,I think that's terrible advice.
782,"No, you don't."
783,ARI: We take boxing and selfdefense classes.
784,I'm not talking about dance lessons.
785,I'm talking about putting a brick through the other guy's windshield.
786,I'm talking about taking it out and chopping it up.
787,What do you mean?
788,"âª The mama pajama rolled out of bed âª âª And she ran to the police station âª âª When the papa found out, he began to shout âª âª And he started the investigation âª âª It's against the law âª Go!"

794,knifed in a bazaar in Calcutta.
795,He carried me to the hospital on his back.
796,Who stabbed you?
797,He did.
798,"Yeah, there was a price on my head and he was a hired assassin."
799,Stuck me right in the gut with a shiv.
800,CHAS: Hey!
801,What?
802,Where have you been?
803,"Uh, we just stepped out to get some air."
804,What's that?
805,Holy shit.
806,That's not?
807,What is that?
808,"Oh, no, no, that's, uh, dog's blood."
809,Come here.
810,What?
811,You stay away from my children.
812,Do you understand?
813,"My God, I haven't been in here for years."
814,Hey! Are you listening to me!
815,"Yes, I am!"
816,I think you've having a nervous breakdown!
817,I don't think you recovered from Rachael's death.
818,I...
819,There you are.
820,How are you feeling?
821,I'm having a ball.
822,Scrapping and yelling and mixing it up.
823,Loving every minute with this damn crew.
824,I want to thank you for raising our children by the way.
825,Okay.
826,I'm not kidding.
827,"You always put them first, didn't you?"
828,I tried to.
829,Lately I feel like maybe I didn't do such a great job.
830,"Goddamn it, don't do that to yourself."
831,I'm the one that failed them.
832,"Or, anyway, it's nobody's fault."
833,"Plus, that  it doesn't..."
834,"Why didn't you give a damn about us, Royal?"
835,Why didn't you care?
836,I don't know.
837,I'm ashamed of myself.
838,"I'll tell you one thing, though..."
839,"you got more grit, fire and guts than any woman I have ever met."
840,What... what are you smiling about?
841,Nothing.
842,"No, wha..."
843,what's so funny?
844,Nothing.
845,It's these little expressions of yours.
846,I don't know what you're talking about but I'll take it as a compliment.
847,"You're true blue, Ethel."
848,You really are.
849,How's your love life?
850,None of your business.
851,I'd like you to talk to Royal about us if you don't mind.
852,"I don't think the timing's right for that, Henry."
853,"Well, I'd agree if I thought he was really going to die in six weeks but I don't."
854,"Well, I hope you're right."
855,"Actually, I don't believe I'll join you tonight."
856,I'll call you in the morning.
857,She said that?
858,Great.
859,Got the sucker on the ropes.
860,"Can I ask you something, Hank?"
861,Okay.
862,Are you trying to steal my woman?
863,I beg your pardon?
864,"You heard me, Coltrane."
865,Coltrane?
866,What?
867,"Did you just call me ""Coltrane""?"
868,No.
869,You didn't?
870,No.
871,Okay.
872,But if I did...
873,"you wouldn't be able to do anything about it, would you?"
874,You don't think so?
875,"No, I don't."
876,"Listen, Royal if you think you can march in here..."
877,You want to talk some jive?
878,I'll talk some jive.
879,I'll talk some jive like you've never heard.
880," Oh, yeah?"
881, Right on!
882, Sit down.
883, What?!
884,Whwhat did you say?
885,"I said sit down, goddamn it!"
886,"Oh, I heard you!"
887,I want you out of my house!
888,This is not your house!
889,I want your raggedy ass out!
890,Don't talk semantics with me.
891,"Oh, this is not your..."
892,What's going on here?
893,Nothing.
894,Mmm.
895,"Hello, I'm calling in regards to a Dr. McClure  yes  at Colby General."
896,The name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.
897,Hmm...
898,Is that a TicTac?
899,How much is he paying you?
900,I don't know what you're talking about.
901,"Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum family, you know."
902,Right.
903,Across the street.
904,Mmhmm.
905,"They've fallen on hard times now, haven't they?"
906,I can't say no.
907,This is bullshit.
908,"Change it, huh?"
909,What did you do to your hand?
910,"Uh, nothing."
911,ROYAL: Can we get somebody over here to kill these mice for us?
912,No. They belong to Chas.
913,"Or anyway, he invented them."
914,"Well, get him to stick them in a fucking cage or something."
915,"Etheline... mind coming up here for a minute, please?"
916,"What's cooking, Pops?"
917,You'll see.
918,"Now, your previous novel..."
919,Yes. Wildcat.
920,Right.
921,Not a success.
922,Why?
923,"Well, Wildcat was written in a kind of obsolete vernacular..."
924,: Wildcat...
925,Wild... cat...
926,Wildcat...
927,I'm going to go.
928,I'm taking this off and I'm going.
929,Stepping out.
930,What the hell kind of way to act is that?
931,ELI: Open the door.
932,He's on drugs.
933,I'll be right back.
934,James Bradley...
935,"Hold on a minute, please."
936,What's going on?
937,Pagoda has something to say.
938,He has a cancer.
939,"No, he doesn't."
940,I know what stomach cancer looks like.
941,I've seen it.
942,And you don't eat three cheeseburgers a day with French fries if you got it.
943,The pain is excruciating.
944,How would you know?
945,My wife had it.
946,Not only is there no Dr. McClure at Colby General there is no Colby General.
947,It closed in 1974.
948,"Aw, shit, man."
949,"Oh, shit, man."
950,"Yes, can you send a taxi to 111 Archer Avenue right away, please?"
951,Thank you.
952,"I guess we're back out on the street, huh, pal?"
953,"Were you part of this, Pagoda?"
954,Of course he was.
955,"No, well, yeah, he was but, I mean, he wasn't that involved."
956,Where'd you get all these medical supplies?
957,A guy at St. Pete's owed me a favor.
958,I did some malpractice work for him.
959,"I do have high blood pressure, though."
960,"Look, I know I'm going to be the bad guy on this one."
961,"But I just want to say, the last six days have been the best six days of probably my whole life."
962,NARRATOR: Immediately after making this statement Royal realized that it was true.
963,"Why'd you do this to us, Royal?"
964,What was the point?
965,I thought I could win you back.
966,And then I thought I could get rid of Henry...
967,and at least keep the status quo.
968,But we hadn't spoken in seven years.
969,I know.
970,"Plus, uh..."
971,I was broke.
972,And I got kicked out of my hotel.
973,You're a bastard.
974,"Goodbye, Royal."
975,"Take it easy on those boys, Chassie."
976,I don't want this to happen to you.
977,"You know, Richie, this illness, this closeness to death has had a profound effect on me."
978,"II feel like a different person, I really do."
979,"Dad, you were never dying."
980,But I'm going to live.
981,He's not your father.
982,Neither are you.
983,You son of a bitch!
984,God... damn...
985,"That's the last time you put a knife in me, hear me?"
986,"The 375th Street Y, please."
987,Everyone's against me.
988,"It's your fault, man."
989,"Yeah, I know, but damn it, I want this family to love me."
990,How much money you got?
991,I don't have.
992,"What, you're broke?"
993,You got to be kidding me.
994,How are we going to pay for this room?
995,"All right, we'll think of something."
996,Ow.
997,I'm not in love with you anymore.
998,I didn't know you ever were.
999,Let's not make this any more difficult than it already is.
1000,Okay.
1001,"Okay, what?"
1002,"Okay, I'm not in love with you, either."
1003,"Yes, I know; you're in love with Richie which is sick and gross."
1004,Do you send my mother your clippings...
1005,and your grades from college?
1006,Please stop belittling me.
1007,You never gave me the time of day till I started getting good reviews.
1008,Your reviews aren't that good.
1009,But the sales are.
1010,Gentlemen... how much do you already know?
1011,"Very little, I'm afraid."
1012,Would you like to examine the report?
1013,Yes.

1019,I appreciate that.
1020,"Uh, which way are you leaning, by the way?"
1021,I'll inform you of my decision at the appropriate time.
1022,I get it.
1023,"Uh, Dusty, put in a good word for us, will you?"

1030,Who?
1031,He'll probably sleep for several hours and then I'll come back to check on him.
1032,All right?
1033,How are you feeling?
1034,"Fine, thanks."
1035,Are you in any pain?
1036,Not really.
1037,Why'd you try to kill yourself?
1038,Don't press him right now.
1039,I wrote a suicide note.
1040,You did?
1041,Yeah.
1042,Right after I regained consciousness.
1043,Can we read it?
1044,No.
1045,Can you paraphrase it for us?
1046,I don't think so.
1047,Is it dark?
1048,Of course it's dark.
1049,It's a suicide note.
1050,"All right, that's enough."
1051,Doctor said to let him sleep.
1052,What?!
1053,"Cover for us, will you, Dusty?"
1054,"Yes. Yes, Royal."
1055,You've made a cuckold of me.
1056,I know.
1057,Many times over.
1058,I'm sorry.
1059,And you nearly killed your poor brother.
1060,ETHELINE: What's he talking about?
1061,It doesn't matter.
1062,She's balling Eli Cash.
1063,"ETHELINE: Oh, my goodness."
1064,May I have a cigarette?
1065,What?
1066,Shall I repeat the question?
1067,You don't smoke.
1068,I know that.
1069,And a light.
1070,Au revoir.
1071,ETHELINE: How long have you been a smoker?
1072,"Well, I think you should quit."
1073,How can I help?
1074,Let me look at these forms.
1075,"Oh, Henry."
1076,"Richie Tenenbaum, please."

1081,II'm sorry.
1082,I have to refer you to Dr. Burrows.
1083,He'll be in tomorrow afternoon.
1084,"We could shimmy up that gutter jump over that window ledge and then, uh, pry open that ventilator shaft."
1085,There he is.
1086,Richie!
1087,Richie.
1088,Where's he going?
1089,Richie!
1090,"Well, I have to say he didn't look half bad for a suicide."
1091,"Attempted, anyway."
1092,Thanks.

1098,I checked myself out.
1099,(rock intro playing on organ) How many stitches did you get?
1100,I don't know.
1101,You want to see?
1102,âª They seem to stay for day after day âª âª And won't disappear... âª Jesus.
1103,"âª I tried every way... âª Richie, that looks horrible."
1104,I heard about your exhusband.
1105,Desmond?
1106,I guess so.
1107,I didn't get his name.
1108,Yeah.
1109,I met him in the ocean.
1110,I was swimming and he came out to me in a canoe.
1111,We were only married nine days.
1112,And I heard about Eli.
1113,I know.
1114,Poor Eli.
1115,"Anyway, they mostly just talked about you."
1116,They did?
1117,Yeah.
1118,"I guess that was the attraction, if you know what I mean."
1119,âª She smiled sweetly âª âª And says don't worry... âª I have to tell you something.
1120,What's that?
1121,I love you.
1122,"I love you, too."
1123,âª There's no use tryin' âª âª You're here âª âª Begin again âª âª And o'er again âª âª That's what she said so softly... âª I can't stop thinking about you.
1124,"I went away for a year, and it only got worse and I don't know what to do."
1125,Let's lie down for a minute.
1126,"âª She smiled sweetly âª âª She smiled sweetly... âª This is the sleeping bag we took to the museum, isn't it?"
1127,Mmhmm.
1128,"âª Oh, no, no, no... âª Why'd you do it?"
1129,Because of me?
1130,"Yeah, but it's not your fault."
1131,"You're not going to do it again, are you?"
1132,I doubt it.
1133,"âª She would never say âª âª Where she came from... âª âª Yesterday don't matter âª âª If it's gone âª âª While the sun is bright âª âª Or in the darkest night âª âª No one knows... âª I think we're just going to have to be secretly in love with each other and leave it at that, Richie."

1137,Yeah.
1138,"What floor, sir?"
1139,Doesn't matter.
1140,"So, you're elevator operators now?"
1141,"Yeah, just started."
1142,We'll get a bump as soon as we join the union.
1143,What made you decide to do that?
1144,We're broke.
1145,"But in answer to your question I wanted to prove I could pay my dues, and whatnot."
1146,I just hope somebody notices.
1147,You asked me why I choked out there that day.
1148,I think I may know the answer and I wanted your advice.
1149,Sure.
1150,Margot Tenenbaum?
1151,Yeah.
1152,"Well, since when?"
1153,Since always.
1154,Does she know?
1155,Uhhuh.
1156,"Well, what does she feel about that?"
1157,I think she feels confused.
1158,"Well, I can understand that."
1159,It's probably illegal.
1160,I don't think so.
1161,We're not related by blood.
1162,That's true.
1163,Still frowned upon.
1164,"But then, what isn't these days, right?"
1165,"I don't know, maybe it works."
1166,"Why not, what the hell."
1167,You love each other.
1168,"Nobody knows what's going to happen, so..."
1169,You know something.
1170,Don't listen to me.
1171,I never understood her myself.
1172,I never understood any of us.
1173,I wish I could tell you what to do but I just can't.
1174,That's okay.
1175,"No, it's not."
1176,You still consider me your father?
1177,"Sure, I do."
1178,I wish I had more to offer in that department.
1179,"I know you do, Pop."
1180,"I don't blame you, by the way."
1181,"Uh, she's a greatlooking girl and smart as a whip."
1182,Mordecai.
1183,âª Stephanie says that she wants to know âª âª Why she's given half her life âª âª To people she hates now... âª Holy shit.
1184,You came back.
1185,Jiminy crickets.
1186,That damn bird must have radar in its brain.
1187,"Is that true, Mordecai?"
1188,II'm not so sure this is Mordecai.
1189,What do you mean?
1190,He flew right in here.
1191,This bird has much more white feathers on him.
1192,"Oh, the son of a bitch must be molting."
1193,Oh. I need your help with something else.
1194,You got it.
1195,What's the situation?
1196,"Well, um, I think Eli maybe..."
1197,Hold it.
1198,"Pagoda, meet me in the lobby."
1199,Let's hit it.
1200,"(shoves lever, elevator speeds up) I didn't mean right this second, but... that's okay."
1201,I don't think it was Ramses.
1202,I believe it was Tootinkamen.
1203,Tutankhamen.
1204,Tutankhamen?
1205,Yes. Tutankhamen.
1206,"(""Rock the Casbah"" playing in background) Yes?"
1207,"Hey, Richie."
1208,We want to take you to get some help.
1209,Is it just you guys?
1210,"ROYAL: Would you excuse us, please?"
1211,Okay.
1212,Are we still friends?
1213,What do you mean?
1214,Are we?
1215,Of course.
1216,How can you even ask me that?
1217,"Well, it doesn't matter."
1218,It doesn't matter?
1219,It does matter.
1220,I heard about you and Margot.
1221,I'm sorry.
1222,I don't know what to say.
1223,You don't have to say anything.
1224,"I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you know."
1225,"Me, too."
1226,"ELI: Course it doesn't mean what it used to though, does it?"
1227,I wish you'd done this for me when I was a kid.
1228,But you didn't have a drug problem then.
1229,"Yeah, but it would've meant a lot to me."
1230,"Anyway, I'm glad you're here now."
1231,I recognize that I have a problem...
1232,and I want to get better.
1233,I'll just grab my stuff.
1234,There he goes.
1235,What?!
1236,There he goes.
1237,Tucker!
1238,"Skiddly, skiddly."
1239,"(""Christmas Time is Here"" playing) âª Christmastime is here âª âª Happiness and cheer... âª I'd like to order some ice cream for my daughter, please."
1240,"What would you like, Margot?"
1241,Nothing. I told you I have to go in five minutes.
1242,Oh.
1243,"I'll have a butterscotch sundae, I guess."
1244,Your brother's all torn up inside.
1245,"Well, so am I, but I'm not going to discuss it with you."
1246,Oh...
1247,Can't somebody be a shit their whole life and try to repair the damage?
1248,"II mean, I think people want to hear that."
1249,Do they?
1250,Mmm.
1251,You probably don't even know my middle name.
1252,That's a trick question.
1253,You don't have one.
1254,Helen.
1255,That was my mother's name.
1256,I know it was.
1257,Anybody interested in grabbing a couple burgers and hitting the cemetery?
1258,"I got something for you, Ethel."
1259,"Actually, I made it."
1260,What's this?
1261,It's a divorce.
1262,From you?
1263,Yes.
1264,This is Sanchez.
1265,He's a notary public.
1266, Hello.
1267," Hello, sir."
1268,You just sign here and initial here and sign there.
1269,"You own this building, don't you, Henry?"
1270,Hmm.
1271,It's magnificent.
1272,I used to be a homeowner myself until our son expropriated it from me.
1273,I got to catch my bus.
1274,"Thanks, Sanchez."
1275,You're welcome.
1276,ETHELINE: Are we divorced?
1277,Almost.
1278,Sanchez just has to file the papers.
1279,"I love you, Etheline."
1280,Congratulations to both of you.
1281,I didn't think so much of him at first.
1282,But now I get it.
1283,He's everything that I'm not.
1284,"Take back Pagoda, will you?"
1285,"Uh, slightly uneven."
1286,Looks okay.
1287,You're just nervous.
1288,Henry?
1289,"Hello, Richie."
1290,Hi.
1291,"This is my son, Walter Sherman."
1292,"Hi, Walter."
1293,Nice to meet you.
1294,Nice to meet you.
1295,Henry's your dad?
1296,Yes.
1297,So you've been married before.
1298,Yes. I'm a widower.
1299,"Oh, yeah."
1300,I forgot.
1301,"You know, I'm a widower myself."
1302,"I know you are, Chas."
1303,(plastic rattling against teeth) What are you chewing on?
1304,My nicotine inhaler.
1305,It's supposed to help me quit.
1306,Is it working?
1307,Not really.
1308,"Well, of course, I'm half Hebrew but the children are threequarters Mick Catholic."
1309,So they were raised in the church?
1310,I believe so.
1311,I really don't know.
1312,Here I come.
1313,Boys!
1314,What was that?
1315,Eli just crashed his car into the front of the house.
1316,"Oh, my God."
1317,Where's my shoe?
1318,"Ari, Uzi, where are you?"
1319,"They're okay, Chas."
1320,It's okay. They're safe.
1321,They're safe.
1322,"Dad, they ran over Buckley."
1323,What?
1324,"Yeah, I think we lost Buckley."
1325,He saved them.
1326,Who?
1327,Dad. He pulled them out of the way.
1328,You did?
1329,Did I hit anyone?
1330,Is everybody okay?
1331,Eli!
1332,What's going on?
1333,CHAS: Eli!
1334,What?
1335,"Hey, man."
1336,You should try this.
1337,It's very tasty.
1338,ELI: Tenenbaum!
1339,Chas?
1340,Did I hit the dog?
1341,Yeah.
1342,Is he dead?
1343,Yeah.
1344,I need help.
1345,So do I.
1346,Go around to the other side.
1347,ROYAL: You kids stay there.
1348,We'll be right back.
1349,HENRY: Yeah.
1350,"Can I say something to you, Henry?"
1351,Okay.
1352,I've always been considered an asshole for about as long as I can remember.
1353,That's just my style.
1354,But I'd really feel blue if I didn't think you were going to forgive me.
1355,"I don't think you're an asshole, Royal."
1356,I just think you're kind of a son of a bitch.
1357,"Well, I really appreciate that."
1358,"Could you let us in your backyard, ma'am?"
1359,We've got a couple boys back there.
1360,I think you may have broken an ankle.
1361,"Well, that's not terribly serious, is it?"
1362,Do you have an alternate?
1363,No.
1364,Ready?
1365,Are there priests on call?
1366,"Why don't you bring the car around, Anwar."
1367,"At which point, I apparently lost control of the vehicle smashed it into the house, and killed that poor dog."
1368,You're Eli Cash.
1369,"Yes indeed, I am."
1370,I love your work.
1371,"Oh, how sweet of you to say."
1372,DISPATCHER ...

1374,What kind of papers do you have for him?
1375,"Spark Plug, sit, sit."
1376,Good boy.
1377,Put this on.
1378,"What's so funny, Dudley?"
1379,You look great.
1380,DUSTY: Can you see out of it?
1381,Not really.
1382,Uhhuh. Minor corneal damage.
1383,Page me if it spreads to the other eye.
1384,Who do I make it out to?
1385,Alex? Okay.
1386,"But these aren't structurebearing elements, Dad."
1387,It doesn't matter.
1388,It's still best to file another force majeure and recoup the deductible.
1389,(background radio communication) You boys come up here with me.
1390,But Buckley's still under there.
1391,"I know, but there's nothing we can do for him at the moment."
1392,: Come on.
1393,I got you a new dog for the boys.
1394,I just bought him.
1395,You did?
1396,"Sorry I let you down, Chas."
1397,All of you.
1398,I been trying to make it up to you.
1399,What's his name?
1400,Spark Plug.
1401,Thank you.
1402,You're welcome.
1403,"I've had a rough year, Dad."
1404,"I know you have, Chassie."
1405,Hey.
1406,"RICHIE: See, now he has more white feathers on his neck."
1407,I wonder what happened to him?
1408,I don't know.
1409,Sometimes if a person has a traumatic experience their hair turns white.
1410,"Well, I'm sure he'll get over it."
1411,This was one of my first hiding places.
1412,How old do you think those are?
1413,I'd say about ten years.
1414,Come here.
1415,(gentle melody plays on acoustic guitar) NARRATOR: Royal dug a hole for Buckley behind the garden shed and buried him in a canvas duffel bag.

1437,"In his will, he stipulated that his funeral take place at dusk."
1438,Among the few possessions he left to his heirs was a set of Encyclopedia Britannica in storage at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel under the names Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.
1439,No one spoke at the funeral and Father Petersen's leg had not yet mended...
1440,but it was agreed among them that Royal would have found the event to be most satisfactory.
1441,Fire!
