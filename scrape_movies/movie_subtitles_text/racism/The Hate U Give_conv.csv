0,"What'd you do with my stuff, man?"
1,"Now, when it happens, don't act mad."
2,You gotta look calm.
3,"Answer their questions, but don't tell 'em nothin' extra."
4,Keep your hands out your pockets.
5,"You drop somethin', leave that shit where it's at."
6,Maverick.
7,Leave that stuff where it's at.
8,My bad.
9,"Now, one day, y'all gonna be with me, and you best bet we gonna get pulled over."
10,That don't mean I did somethin' wrong.
11,Maybe I made a mistake driving or maybe I ain't do nothin' at all.
12,You gonna see me with my hands like this.
13,On the dashboard.
14,Come on.
15,"Now, you keep your hands posted 'cause moving makes the police get all nervous."
16,"If I ain't with you, you ask for me."
17,"It can get real dangerous, so don't argue with them..."
18,but keep your hands where they can see 'em.
19,This how you gonna act.
20,We straight?
21,I was nine years old when I first got the talk.
22,"Seven, my halfbrother, was ten."
23,Sekani was one.
24,"Now, just because we gotta deal with this mess..."
25,don't you ever forget that being black is a honor 'cause you come from greatness.
26,"Now, this the Black Panther TenPoint Program."
27,This our own Bill of Rights.
28,I want you to learn it.
29,'Cause Imma ask you about it.
30,Imma quiz you.
31,"Really, Maverick?"
32,Know your rights.
33,Know your worth.
34,You understand?
35,Starr. Two R's.
36,Daddy named me that.
37,"And don't ask me what the extra ""R"" is for."
38,Sekani! Learn how to aim! Dang!
39,Mama! Sekani peed everywhere again!
40,"And, boy, wipe that seat."
41,Mama and Daddy had me when they were 17.
42,My nana even threw Mama out the house.
43,Said Daddy was no good...
44,just a pusher for the King Lords gang.
45," Hey, baby."
46, You seen my wallet?
47," Yeah, I put it on the dresser."
48, I can't find it.
49,"Well, I know it's there, baby."
50,I put it there.
51, Good morning.
52, Good morning.
53,She swore raising the dead was more likely than Mama and Daddy making it.
54,Mama...
55,They stay proving her and everybody else wrong.
56,"And in large part, that means making sure that we don't make the same mistakes."
57,You know what?
58,Why don't you just sit your cute butt down and let me do what I do. Okay?
59,"Oh, really?"
60,You gonna let me do what I do?
61,Ain't they too old for that?
62,Boy...
63," Good morning, y'all."
64, Good morning.
65,"Their cuteness can be extra, but they're adorable."
66, I love you.
67, I love you.
68,I can't even lie.
69,They're my OTP.
70,One true pairing.
71,Mama and Daddy were born in Garden Heights.
72,Their first kiss was in the Haven Acres Projects.
73,Daddy says our life is here.
74,'Cause our people are here.
75,We got Mr. Reuben's barbecue...
76,...Mr. Lewis's barbershop...
77,...a Walmart and Daddy's store.
78,"Carter's Grocery is where you get your milk, Newport shorts, Hot Cheetos, hot gossip, and anything else that you might need in a hurry."
79,Mama thinks Daddy is scared of change.
80,She left the Garden when she was a little girl.
81,And she wants us to get out too.
82,"Either way, you gotta stay ready."
83,'Cause Garden Heights is always gonna be ready for you.
84,"Seven? Now, are you staying at your mama's house or with us tonight?"
85,At Mama's.
86,As long as King ain't there.
87,And then there's King.
88,He runs the King Lords.
89,My dad used to be his righthand man.
90,"The high school is where you go to get jumped, high, pregnant, or killed."
91,We don't go there.
92,Not since what happened to my friend Natasha.
93,So Mama sent us to another school where everyone's collegebound.
94, Sekani?
95, Yeah?
96,"Baby, remind me what your name means again."
97,Joy!
98,"Yes! So that means I want you to be just as big a joy at school as you are at home, okay?"
99,Okay!
100,But less loud!
101,Why you yelling?
102,You guys have a good day.
103," Love you, Mommy!"
104," I love you too, Sekani."
105,Garden Heights is one world.
106,Williamson is another.
107,And I gotta keep it separate.
108,"So when I'm here, I'm Starr Version Two."
109," See you later, bro."
110, Peace out.
111,That means flipping a switch in my brain.
112,Williamson Starr doesn't use slang.
113,"If a rapper would say it, she doesn't."
114,Even if her white friends do.
115,"Hey, boo."
116," Hey, how are you?"
117," I'm good, girl."
118,Slang makes them cool.
119,"Slang makes me ""hood."" Yo! Those kicks are lit!"
120,Thanks. Space Jams.
121,Williamson Starr is approachable.
122,No stank eyes or yelling because Williamson Starr is nonconfrontational.
123,"Basically, Williamson Starr doesn't give anyone a reason to call her ghetto."
124,And I hate myself for doing it.
125,Let me at him.
126,I'll kick his ass.
127,"Hailey, you're violent."
128,"Uh, okay. If someone tries to do some shit to my girl, I have to get him."
129,"I'm serious, Starr."
130,I will go after him.
131,I will kick his ass.
132,I do not care.
133,You just say the word.
134,Hailey must've watched Straight Outta Compton again last night.
135,"You just say the word, and I'm gonna do it."
136,What did you say to him?
137,"We're not really talking right now, so..."
138,Who's not really talking to whom?
139,"Well, Chris lured Starr over to his house and sprung a condom on her."
140,What did you say?
141,"No, no, no. What did you do?"
142,What size was it?
143,"Maya! Oh, my God!"
144,"You're on a ""need to know."" Okay! And I need to know."
145,"Look, Chris is great, but I'm just not ready."
146,"And eventually, I'll get there, but he just assumed."
147,Assuming. Punishable by death.
148,"So, you're gonna Taylor Swift this?"
149,She doesn't even rank on the angry girlfriend scale anymore.
150,Nah. I'm gonna BeyoncÃ© his ass.
151,Watch.
152,"I really wanna ""Elevator Solange"" his ass."
153,Damn.
154,He's wearing the same Space Jam Elevens as mine.
155,He knows Jordans are my weakness.
156,He smells like Old Spice.
157,His lips are soft.
158,He swear he's DJ Khaled.
159,I can't lie.
160,It still gets me every time.
161,Nuhuh. Nope.
162,I don't like what you did the other day.
163,"Starr, I'm sorry."
164, I messed up. Bad.
165, Mmhmm.
166,But I keep thinking that we're getting closer...
167,"and ask to take you out on Saturday, and you don't say yes."
168, I'm busy.
169, Right.
170,Every time?
171,So I figure maybe you want me to meet your parents first.
172,"But whenever I ask to come over, you never say yes."
173,They're busy too.
174,"Well, it seems like everyone's busy, Starr."
175,"So then I think, ""How do I get closer to my own girlfriend?"
176,"Maybe she wants to skip the whole flowers and chocolate part and just get right to it."" Chris, you are acting a damn fool, if you think I'm one of these little thirsty girls running around here that you can hit."
177,"Starr, you're not."
178,"You're way more important than that to me, okay."
179,We've been dating for almost six months.
180,"And if you can't tell that by now, then I don't know what else you want me to say."
181,Other than I miss you.
182,A lot.
183,I made that beat for you.
184,Come on.
185,You gotta tell me that's fire.
186,It's a'ight.
187,I wanna hear you say it.
188,It's okay.
189,Wow. Okay.
190,I guess that means I gotta test it.
191,"I'm fully aware that some people would accuse him of acting black, but this is just Chris."
192,And he makes me laugh.
193,"Hey! Get it, man!"
194,"Oh, my God."
195,Don't spin. Come on.
196,Do you forgive me now?
197,Yeah.
198,We get the questions.
199,Why is he dating her?
200,"On the real, I sometimes wonder the same thing."
201,"Now, the stares usually come from the rich white girls."
202,But they're way too scared to actually say anything to our faces.
203,Let me take you somewhere on Saturday.
204,To do what?
205,We can eat burgers.
206,I let you beat me in foosball...
207,Let me beat you?
208, Mmhmm.
209, And then we can kiss on a Ferris wheel.
210,That is so cheesy.
211,That's what I got.
212,Okay. But can we do Sunday instead?
213,I'll pick you up?
214,I'll meet you.
215,Augustine's?
216,Mmhmm. 3:ÃÃ?
217,So romantic.
218,You are a fool.
219,I'm your fool.
220,Yeah.
221,That is true.
222,Chris is the best thing about being Starr Version Two.
223,And sometimes I think that's all I want to be.
224,Until the weekend comes around.
225,I'm not sure I belong at this party either though.
226,Neither version of me.
227,Hey!
228,Kenya's about the only person I hang out with in Garden Heights.
229,Even if she gets on my nerves sometimes. I swear.
230,Man.
231,What?
232,"I mean, every girl in here all laid and slayed but you wanna come up in here looking basic as hell."
233,"What? Girl, these are the Retro Threes."
234,"Classic and comfortable, and watch."
235,You're gonna be wishing that you was wearing them tonight when you limpin' out of here like a brokedown gazelle. Bam.
236,"Man, ain't that my brother hoodie?"
237,"Our brother's hoodie, Kenya, yeah."
238,"Yeah, dressed like that, got folks thinking you're my girlfriend."
239,"Kenya, if I had known following you to this party meant that I would be on some Extreme Makeover Starr Edition mess, I would've stayed home and watched my Fresh Prince reruns."
240,"Oh, girl, you got to let the 9Ãs perish."
241,What now?
242,"There go that trick, Denasia."
243,"Ooh, I can't stand her ass."
244,Always talking smack about how I'm trying to steal her uglyass man.
245,"Oh, for real?"
246,"Man, you so lucky you go to that private school."
247,You don't gotta deal with hoes like that.
248,"No. There's hoes at my school, too."
249,"Trust me, hoedom is universal."
250,"Feel my stink eye, bitch."
251,Feel my stink eye.
252," Oh, we about to handle her tonight."
253, Hold up. We?
254,"What? What, you too good now to have my back?"
255, Don't even!
256, Don't even what?
257,You only brought me here to tag team a bitch?
258,Ain't like you had shit else to do.
259, I'm doing your black ass a favor.
260, Wow!
261,"Oh, my God! You do know I have friends, right?"
262,Them bougie girls from your school do not count.
263,"Yo, Kenya!"
264,What up?
265, Hey.
266, How you doing?
267, I'm good.
268," Hey, boo."
269,"Now, you know you ain't have to bring your sister out dressed like that."
270,We ain't sisters.
271,"Yeah, just 'cause my mama and her daddy made Seven, don't make us related."
272,"I mean, she my girl, but Seven don't make us kin."
273,"Anyway, leave Starr alone, Bianca."
274,She's used to partying amongst the whites.
275,"Yo, I bet they be poppin' Mollies and all kind of pills, don't they?"
276,Listening to Taylor Swift ass trying to sing.
277,Y'all are just reaching...
278,"Wait, that's true."
279, Exactly. We know.
280, Yeah.
281,"Anyway, I was talking about rollin' up on Denasia ass."
282, Old trick.
283, Yep.
284,"You know she be running her mouth about you, right?"
285, Word.
286, Bitch need her ass beat.
287," Well, let's go."
288, Come on.
289, You comin'?
290, No.
291,"Well, I'm not babysitting you all night, so, like, take care of yourself."
292,Scary.
293,Khalil.
294,Look at the sea of people parting for you like you a brownskinned Moses.
295,Those dimples.
296,What am I supposed to do with that?
297,And I used to take baths with you in your grandmama's tub when she used to babysit me and Seven.
298,Weird what the sight of Khalil's brown eyes do to me now.
299,Starr!
300,Damn.
301,What?
302,It's been a minute.
303,What's up? Where you been at?
304,School. Basketball. Keeps me busy.
305,Mmhmm.
306,But I'm always up at Daddy's store.
307,You the one no one sees anymore.
308,"Yeah, I've been a little busy myself."
309,Mmhmm.
310,What's up? What?
311,Nothin.
312,How's your grandmama and Cameron doing?
313,"He just turned ten, right?"
314,Yeah. They all right.
315,Grandma's sick though.
316,The doctor say she got cancer or some shit.
317,"Damn. I'm sorry, K."
318,"Yeah, she's taking chemo."
319,But really the only thing she's worried about is putting the wig on top of her head.
320,"Shit, I'm thinking about taking hers. Look."
321, She turnt up.
322, She's going in.
323,"Come on, let me see you turn up like she turn up."
324,Yeah. Yeah.
325,You know this.
326,"See, I would've thought you was into the indie rock or maybe country or..."
327,Everyone knows this song.
328,"I mean, I know you be hanging with all the white kids."
329, I'm just saying.
330, Shut up. You better stop.
331,"Oh, damn! Did I scuff you?"
332,I'm so sorry.
333,"No, no, no."
334,Stop. Stop. Don't scrub.
335,Gotta be gentle.
336,"Every time a sneaker is cleaned improperly, a kitten dies."
337,Sneakerhead!
338,"Okay, well, I see you."
339,You obviously making big money if you rockin' those.
340,"What up, bro?"
341,"What's up, man?"
342,"You know what is, bro."
343,This is my area.
344,"Ain't no business doing over here, bro?"
345,Cut it out!
346,"Move, man! What's up, man?"
347,Come on.
348,It's always some shit.
349,You see that?
350,We can't even have a party without somebody getting shot at.
351,Damn.
352,"Man, so you gonna come at me for my music, while you listening to this old stuff?"
353,"Oh, old stuff?"
354,You better get up out my car with that.
355,Tupac is the truth.
356,"Yeah, 2Ã years ago."
357,"No, even still, right now."
358,"Listen, let me tell you something."
359,"Pac said, THUG LIFE means ""The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody."" THUGLIFE."
360,Meaning what?
361,"Meaning what society gives to us when we little comes back to bite them in the ass when we grow up, and we wild out."
362,You get that?
363,Damn. Yeah.
364,Pac's gonna always be relevant.
365,"So you gonna tell me why you really been busy, Khalil?"
366,Because that McJob that I had didn't make nothin' happen.
367,And plus Grandma got fired from the hospital when they found out she was sick.
368,"Damn, that's messed up, K, for real."
369,"You know, we got needs."
370,If you selling that stuff...
371,"Hey, come on now."
372,"Mind your business, StarrStarr."
373,Don't worry about me.
374,I'm doing what I gotta do.
375,"Man, you piss me off sometimes."
376,"Oh, yeah?"
377,So you pissed off right now?
378,Yeah.
379,You don't really look too pissed off.
380,"So, you know, I couldn't tell if you was pissed off."
381,I'm really mad at you.
382,"Oh, I just heard from Kenya."
383,She's good.
384,Cool.
385,"So, why are we stopped?"
386,Because I wanna look at you in your eyes while I'm talking to you.
387, Somethin' wrong with that?
388, Hmm.
389,"Not inherently, no."
390,Not inherently.
391, Not inherently.
392, What?
393,That school got you messed up.
394,"I saw you out there one time, too."
395,When?
396,Y'all was headed there.
397,You had your little skirt on.
398,Your kneehighs.
399,Your backpack.
400,You was ready.
401,What do you mean you saw me one time?
402,So you stalking me now?
403,"Whoa, now."
404,No.
405,I just like seeing you. That's all.
406,We used to see each other damn near every day  when we was kids.
407, Yeah.
408,Do you remember when we used to play Harry Potter?
409,Yeah.
410,What did we call ourselves?
411,Uh...
412, The Hood Trio.
413, The Hood Trio.
414,We were some badass Bad.
415,You still have your wand?
416,"Hell, no. I ain't got that wand."
417,I don't have the wand.
418,I know you still have it.
419,I don't have it. I threw it away because you would never let me be Harry.
420, Because you were Ron!
421, But I was really Harry.
422,No. I was Harry.
423,You were Ron.
424,Natasha was Hermione.
425,Okay.
426,So that first kiss we had?
427,In the church basement.
428,Mmhmm.
429,Yep.
430,"Man, we were some heathens."
431,So you telling me that I was kissing Harry Potter?
432,Yeah.
433,"Yeah, you were."
434,All right.
435,So who am I kissing right now?
436,"Khalil, I..."
437,I got a boyfriend.
438,"Yeah, I heard."
439,I didn't wanna hear.
440,But it's all good.
441,Really?
442,"We've been together our whole lives, Starr."
443,We got time.
444,All right?
445,Damn. What I do?
446,I don't know.
447,"EightCharlie, Fourteenth and Third."
448,Damn.
449,"Khalil, put your hands on the dash where he can see them."
450,"Khalil, put your hands on the dash! I'm not playing."
451,"Starr, we ain't done nothing."
452,"What'd we drive, like 5Ã feet?"
453,Please.
454,Please. Just do it.
455,Okay.
456,"Sir, can you roll your window down for me?"
457,Here we go.
458,I need to see your driver's license and registration.
459,For what? What'd I do?
460,"Sir, license and registration."
461,"Khalil, keep your hands on the dash."
462,"Starr, how am I supposed to get him my license and registration if I have to stay still?"
463,I wanna know why you pulling me over.
464,You failed to signal a lane change.
465, Come on.
466, Turn the music off.
467,Why? I can hear you.
468," Please, Khalil!"
469, Turn it off.
470,This is my car.
471,So how can you tell me...
472, Step out of the car.
473, You ain't got no right to do this to me.
474,"Listen, I'm giving you a lawful order."
475,"Khalil, listen to him."
476,Is it for failing to signal my lane change or for failing to turn down my music? Which one?
477,"Sir, out of the car, now!"
478,"Either you get out of the car yourself, or I'm gonna do it for you."
479,Now!
480,Drop the phone!
481,"Yo, why don't you just give me my ticket?"
482,Hands on the car.
483,Anything on you?
484,"No, there's nothing on me."
485, Any drugs?
486," Nah, man."
487,"Can you remove your driver's license, please?"
488, Where'd you find her?
489, I know her. That's my friend.
490,You looking for a score tonight?
491,What? A score?
492,"Yo, come on, man."
493,Keep your hands on the car. Do not move.
494,Can I get a license run on...
495,Shit.
496,Where's my phone?
497,Shit!
498,"Starr, you okay?"
499, You all right?
500, Go back where he told you.
501,He gonna take his time doing whatever he gotta do.
502,I'm not playing. Go back.
503,"Yo, but come on!"
504,Why you messing up my car?
505," Just listen to him, Khalil!"
506," Okay! All right, chill."
507,Stop right there! Stop!
508, Do not move.
509, No. No.
510,No.
511,"No, Khalil."
512,"Be quiet, ma'am."
513,You sit down.
514,No.
515,Officer needs help.
516,Shots fired.
517,One suspect down.
518,The other in custody.
519,Requesting an ambulance.
520,What did you do?
521,What did you do?
522,"Be quiet, ma'am."
523,Help him!
524,"I want you to stay where you are! Do not move, okay?"
525,He's bleeding!
526,Help him! Come on!
527,He's bleeding!
528,Where is it?

539,"Look at me, come on!"
540,"Khalil, come on, look at me!"
541,I'm right here.
542,"You're okay, all right?"
543,There's a ambulance coming.
544,Can you hear it?
545,It's coming. It's gonna take care of you.
546,"You're gonna be fine, all right?"
547,You're gonna be okay.
548,Don't be scared.
549,"Come on, look at me!"
550,"Look at me, Khalil. Come on!"
551,"Breathe, Starr."
552,"Starr, breathe."
553,"Who did that, man?"
554,The officer who did it...
555,I understand that. I know.
556,I'm Detective Gomez.
557,"And this is my partner, Detective Wilkes."
558,"Uh, Lisa Carter."
559,I'm her mother.
560,Starr Carter.
561,"Can you tell us what happened tonight, Starr?"
562,I went to this party.
563,"And Khalil was there, too."
564,Why was Khalil there?
565,"Same as everybody else, I guess."
566,Just recreational purposes.
567,Witnesses at the party stated that there was an altercation and gunshots.
568,Did Khalil have anything to do with it?
569,Nah.
570,I mean... no.
571,"We were, uh, just talking..."
572,when the fight broke out.
573,He offered to take me home because he wanted to make sure that I got home safely.
574,And that's when 115 pulled us over for no reason.
575,Who?
576,The officer.
577,That's his badge number.
578,I remember it.
579,"Starr, do you know why Khalil reached into the car?"
580,I think he was checking to see that I was okay.
581,You think?
582,You don't know?
583,"No, I don't know."
584,Because?
585,Because that's when it happened.
586, Did you and Khalil...
587, Uh...
588,Would you please just give her a second?
589,Whenever you're ready.
590,"Okay, baby?"
591,We understand that this is hard right now.
592,Do you?
593,"Yes, Mrs. Carter, we do."
594,Take your time.
595,Did you drink alcohol at the party?
596,"No, I don't drink."
597,Did Khalil?
598,Not that I saw.
599,Did you ever see Khalil sell narcotics?
600,"No, I never personally saw Khalil sell drugs or do drugs."
601,But you knew that he did?
602,You have not asked my daughter one question about the cop.
603,"We just want the whole picture, miss."
604,"Well, you ask questions about what happened."
605,And he didn't do anything wrong.
606,So I don't know what more of a bigger picture you need!
607,She's done here.
608,"Come on, Lisa. Come on, Starr."
609,You know her?
610,"Yeah, she's my niece."
611,All right. All right.
612,I'm here.
613,I'm here.
614,Yeah.
615,Let it out. Let it out.
616,Easy. Let it out.
617,"Yeah, let it out."
618,Here. Here.
619,"It's okay, baby."
620,"It's okay, baby. It's okay."
621,It's okay.
622,Here. Drink this now.
623,"It's okay, baby."
624,Nightmares are always the worst right after.
625,"Sekani, no."
626,Starr first. Let her eat.
627,"You know, not everybody got superpowers like you."
628,Shine your light.
629,I ain't name you Starr by accident.
630,Sekani!
631,No!
632,Thank you.
633,You the only real friend that boy ever had.
634,"He was mine, too, Miss Rosalie."
635,Police came by.
636,"Was you with him, Starr?"
637,"Yes, ma'am."
638,Thank God he didn't leave this world alone.
639,"You been by his side from day one, and you stayed all the way to the end."
640,"He was selling that stuff, you know."
641,Can't be for nobody but King.
642,You got some nerve coming in here.
643,What's he doing here?
644,"Hey, Carlos."
645,"Hi, Lisa."
646,Excuse me.
647,"Miss Rosalie, I came by to tell you I'm sorry for your loss."
648,And Pam and I have been praying for you.
649,Thank you so much.
650,There's anything I can do for you...
651,know we are here for you.
652,Love you.
653,Look out.
654,So what's the deal?
655,His ass in jail?
656,They're gonna place him on paid administrative leave.
657,That's it?
658,After he killed Khalil?
659,"Starr, there will be a full investigation."
660,"Cops investigating cops, huh?"
661,You know they should've charged his racist ass with murder.
662,"But that ain't gonna happen, is it, Uncle Carlos?"
663,Nothing like this has ever happened with this officer before.
664,"Oh, firsttimer. Let's cut him a break."
665,"Carlos, you're gonna help with the investigation, right?"
666,I can't. We hand situations like this over to the DA.
667,We headed for a grand jury?
668,Most likely.
669,"And let me guess, they gonna ask Starr to testify."
670,"No, no, no, no, no."
671,I don't want everyone knowing that Starr is the witness.
672,She doesn't need that kind of attention.
673,No! Should we get a lawyer?
674,Witnesses don't need attorneys.
675,"Starr ain't just a witness, 'Los."
676,"Look, if you don't trust the system, can you at least trust me?"
677, Starr is like my daughter.
678, But she ain't.
679,It didn't seem that way when you was locked up.
680,Stop it! Both of you!
681,What does a grand jury mean?
682,Grand jury.
683,Stuff like this ends up on the news.
684,People get death threats.
685,Cops target them.
686,What will it mean at school?
687,Will I suddenly be the poor girl from the hood who saw her friend get killed?
688,I just gotta be quiet.
689,Can you just give me more chicken?
690," Starr, open!"
691, Starr!
692,"Starr, pass it!"
693,Damn!
694,"Starr, just pretend the ball is a piece of fried chicken!"
695, What was that?
696, What? It's game talk.
697,"""Fried chicken"" is game talk?"
698,I've never heard that one before.
699,"Holy shit. Starr, we had fried chicken for lunch?"
700,IIt was a joke.
701,Okay.
702,"Wait. What's going on, girl?"
703,"I mean, you know me, I know you, better than anyone."
704,You okay?
705,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine."
706,I'm just tired.
707,All right. Imma put Mav's hot links on the grill.
708,Little burnt on top and crusty on the side.
709,Y'all go ahead and take some pound cake while y'all wait.
710," Thanks, Mr. Reuben."
711," Thank you, Mr. Reuben."
712,...17yearold black teenager by a white police officer Saturday night.
713,New information is being released regarding the shooting death of Khalil Harris.
714,"Dashcam footage, where the officer thought he was going for a weapon shows it was not a gun but a hairbrush."
715,My son ain't never done nothing wrong!
716, Khalil was a good boy!
717, Mmhmm.
718,Why'd they have to do that to him?
719,What this have to happen for?
720,"What, he can't even walk down the street and brush his damn hair?"
721,"I mean, why would they put Miss Brenda on TV like that?"
722,There's a witness to the shooting who'll be called to testify in front of the grand jury.
723,Community leaders are up in arms...
724,So you famous now.
725,What?
726,I saw you leave with Khalil.
727,Now you all jittery and jumpy and shit.
728,"It's you, Starr."
729,Don't even lie.
730,You ready to stir some shit up?
731,What you mean?
732,"Well, you was there, so you gotta tell everybody what happened."
733,"You're gonna stand up for Khalil, right?"
734,"Listen, Brenda can't be the only one talking."
735,You know Khalil would've stood tall and spoke for you.
736,"Hey, queens."
737,"Hi, Daddy!"
738,Get in the car.
739,"Nah, I'm good."
740,I'll take you up to Big Mav's.
741,Get in the car.
742,Make up for what you spent.
743,"No, thanks."
744,What?
745,Heard you was with that boy when he got himself killed.
746,Some hard shit to see.
747,"Believe me, it's hard to forget, too."
748,I been in the Heights forever.
749,So trust.
750,I been where you at.
751,Hurt like that don't never leave you.
752,But you gotta keep pushing.
753,You feel me?
754,Mama at the house?
755,I don't know.
756,Iesha be where she at.
757,Ew.
758,What about Seven?
759,Why your daddy and Iesha name that boy Seven?
760,What's his middle name? Eight?
761,"Hey, Uncle Mav."
762,"Hey, Kenya."
763,How's that domestic life treatin' you?
764,"You go ahead, put a ring on Iesha."
765,You gonna find out.
766,Look like business is going well.
767,Guess I should've bought this store for me instead of you.
768,But you didn't.
769,I heard about Starr's homeboy.
770,"Man, you know how they do."
771,"Shoot first, ask questions later."
772,You really should try and keep her out of trouble.
773,Trouble?
774,"I'm just saying, I think it's best if she don't talk to FiveO."
775,You feel me?
776,You ain't got to worry about Starr.
777,"You take care of your girl, and I'll handle mine."
778, It's like that?
779, It's exactly like that.
780,"Hey, Starr."
781,"Remember what I told you, all right?"
782,You keep that shit in your rearview.
783,Mnhmnh.
784,I'm telling you.
785,He was threatening her!
786,He ain't gonna hurt her.
787,He will.
788,"If he thinks that Starr is gonna tell the police that Khalil worked for him, he will."
789,And then what? Hmm?
790,He's gonna rope you right back in.
791,"Once a King Lord, always a King Lord."
792,"When you spend three years in lockup doing somebody else's time, ain't no roping back in."
793,He let me out.
794,That was our deal.
795,Maverick...
796,we're moving.
797,"Baby, we could do some good stuff around here."
798,"Where you live does not define who you are, Maverick."
799," Baby, listen to me..."
800, No!
801,You listen!
802,It's okay to make sacrifices for your family.
803,God! Do you think that my mother moved me and Carlos out of Garden Heights and into that Catholic school so we could learn how to pray? No.
804,I'm gonna make sure that my kids have it at least as good as I did.
805,"If not, what's the point?"
806,That's why we have them up there in that school!
807,And what do you think that school will do when they find out that Starr was with Khalil?
808,Hmm?
809,"Those white folks, they love to boast about how diverse that school is, but you know what?"
810,This is too much diversity for them.
811,"I don't feel good, so I'm not going."
812,"None of us feel good, Starr, but we're pressing on anyway."
813,So you go get dressed.
814, I...
815, Go get dressed.
816, Can I come in?
817, Yeah.
818,Maybe when we get back...
819,we can watch that Harry Potter and the Goblet of HalfBlood Gumble Ghosts.
820,"I think I'm good, Daddy."
821,You the worst person to watch Harry Potter with.
822,"The whole time you're like, ""Harry Potter is about the gang theory.""  It is."
823, Mmhmm.
824,"Hogwarts houses have they own colors, they own hideouts, and they always ridin' for each other."
825,How that ain't about gangs?
826, You know I'm right.
827, Mmhmm.
828,Y'all had y'all's own little Harry Potter gang.
829,"Now Natasha and Khalil both gone, and you still here."
830,Trying to make some sense out of it.
831,It's THUG LIFE.
832,"""The Hate U Give Little Infants..."" ""F's Everybody."" I know what it stands for."
833,What do you think it means?
834,I think it's about more than just the youth.
835,I think it's about us.
836,Us who?
837,Black people.
838,Poor people.
839,Everybody at the bottom.
840,"Right, you on it."
841,Pac was trying to school us on how the system's designed against us.
842,Why else you think so many people in our neighborhood deal?
843, They need the money.
844, Yeah.
845,"And there ain't no real jobs around here, so they fall into the trap."
846,What trap?
847,Drugs a multibilliondollar industry.
848,Brothers like me and Khalil get caught up 'cause it look like a way out.
849,But that shit is flown into our communities...
850,and I don't know nobody with a private jet.
851, Do you?
852, Mnhmnh.
853,Me neither.
854,And then they trap us.
855,"And we end up in prison, another billiondollar hustle."
856,And they got us riding through there like we on a conveyor belt.
857,That's how I end up in prison with my daddy.
858,You went to jail with your own daddy?
859,Yep.
860,"But when I caught up with him, wasn't nothin' he can do to help me."
861,"He was just a weak, old man with regrets."
862,And his light was gone.
863,And I swore that would never be me.
864,Because Imma break the cycle for my kids.
865,I'm not ready to see Khalil as a soulless mannequin.
866,His lips are too pink.
867,And he doesn't have his dimples.
868,"Come on, baby."
869,"It ain't him, Mama."
870,I know.
871,We got time.
872,"Hey, you all right?"
873,Your mama's here with King.
874,Seven!
875,Seven!
876,Come on back here with us!
877,"Baby, go back there with your mother."
878,You know he don't want to sit with her.
879,"I know, but she's yellin' in the church, baby."
880,Amen! Hallelujah!
881,"Amen! Thank you, choir, for blessing us with such wonderful..."
882,praise and worship.
883,Amen! Brothers and sisters.
884,We have a speaker here with us today.
885,The Harris family have asked us all to listen to what she has to say.
886,"Come on up, Sister April Ofrah."
887,"I'm April Ofrah, a lawyer with Just Us For Justice."
888,"Just before the service, I was informed that the police have no intentions of arresting the officer who murdered this young man."
889,Despite having a credible eyewitness.
890,"Oh, my God!"
891,This is the last place I wanted to be today.
892,And I know I'm not alone.
893,But here we are again.
894,"Violence, brutality."
895,"It's the same story, just a different name."
896,Yes. You're right.
897,Today's name is Khalil Harris.
898,"Another unarmed, young, black man."
899,What does that tell us?
900,Shamell Bell said it best.
901,"""It is impossible to be unarmed when our blackness is the weapon that they fear."" And I refuse to let our blackness be seen as a weapon or as a weakness."
902, Yeah!
903, Yeah! That's right!
904,That is why the Harris family and I ask you to join us after the service for a peaceful march past the police station.
905,Division is how they win.
906, Unity is how they crumble.
907, Yeah!
908,See you outside after the service. Thank you.
909,Amen!
910, Thank you!
911, Whoo!
912,"Thank you, Sister Ofrah, for such powerful and encouraging words."
913,Did you see that?
914,How does she even know?
915,Gotta be Miss Rosalie.
916,...to join our sister in her peaceful march forjustice!
917,"Not only for Brother Khalil, but for all of us!"
918,Khalil's life will not be in vain!
919,That's right!
920,Yeah! Hallelujah!
921,What do we want?
922,Justice for Khalil!
923, When do we want it?
924, Now!
925, What do we want?
926, Justice for Khalil!
927, When do we want it?
928, Now!
929, What do we want?

955, When do we want it?
956, Now!
957, What do we want?
958, Justice for Khalil!
959, What do we want?
960, Justice for Khalil!

963, What do we want?
964, Justice for Khalil!
965, When do we want it?
966, Now!
967, What do we want?
968, Justice for Khalil!
969, When do we want it?
970, Now!
971,"Remember, this is a peaceful protest!"
972,I ain't too sure about that.
973,"Boy, don't put your hands on me!"
974,This is a peaceful protest!
975,You pushed her!
976," No justice, no peace!"
977, No racist police!
978,"No justice, no peace! No racist police!"
979,"All right, we gotta leave."
980,"No justice, no peace!"
981,Let's go!
982,No racist police!
983,"No justice, no peace..."
984,"Hey, Seven!"
985,Come on.
986,What the hell you talkin' about?
987,"No justice, no peace! No racist police!"
988,"No justice, no peace!"
989,No racist police!
990,"No justice, no peace!"
991,No racist police!
992,"No justice, no peace!"
993,No racist police!
994,"No justice, no peace!"
995,No racist police!
996,"No justice, no peace!"
997,"A protest took place in the neighborhood of Garden Heights following the funeral of Khalil Harris, a young black man who was killed by a police officer."
998,"And though the protest started peacefully, it quickly turned violent as protesters and police clashed."
999,This comes after no charges were brought forward against the police officer who has been placed on administrative leave until all the evidence can be evaluated.
1000,We now take you to coverage from earlier this evening.
1001,I'm here with the protesters on the way to the police station.
1002,That cop shot that boy in cold blood for no damn reason!
1003,"Innocent black men keep getting killed by the police time and time again, and it ain't right!"
1004,The whole damn system is corrupt as hell.
1005,"As you can see, emotions are high here in Garden Heights."
1006,"The community is outraged with what has been happening, and they are seeking justice."
1007,Bullets don't know where they supposed to go.
1008,"Hey, Mama, are they mad 'cause Khalil died?"
1009,"Yeah, baby. We all are."
1010,That's what's up!
1011,"They're afraid of us, y'all!"
1012,Hey.
1013,Are you and your family safe?
1014,I'm watching the news.
1015,"Yeah. Yeah, we're fine."
1016,We're completely safe.
1017,You sure?
1018,"Maverick, don't answer it."
1019,I gotta go.
1020,"Hold on, Starr."
1021,Starr.
1022,Who is it?
1023, Hi.
1024, Hello.
1025,Can I come in?
1026,As police are investigating the routine traffic stop that turned...
1027,Khalil can't speak for himself.
1028,He needs a voice.
1029,Starr is it.
1030,I don't like this already.
1031,"Lisa, just hear her on out."
1032,"Starr, do you understand what a grand jury is?"
1033,Yeah. It's where they decide if somebody should go to trial.
1034,Right. It's when they decide if charges should be brought against Officer Macintosh.
1035,Will they indict him?
1036,the grand jury indicts.
1037,What about that one percent they don't?
1038,Those cases almost always involve a cop.
1039,"But that won't happen this time, because I saw everything."
1040,"When Khalil was shot, where were you exactly?"
1041,In the passenger seat.
1042,Do you have any proof of what you saw?
1043,"Like, did you record it on a phone?"
1044,"Nah, the officer told me to drop it."
1045,So Khalil will never have his day in court?
1046,All 'cause a cop shot him?
1047,That's why our trial begins now.
1048,"On the streets, in the media."
1049,Starr is Khalil's only witness.
1050,All right.
1051,Where do we start?
1052,With a TV interview.
1053,No.
1054,"I know what you're fighting for, but I fight for Starr."
1055,And I won't put her at risk.
1056,Thank you.
1057,My other best friend was murdered when we were both ten.
1058,We were playing basketball on the sidewalk.
1059,When this car rolled by...
1060,and this tatted hand pulled out a gun.
1061,We must have been in the way.
1062,It was three shots.
1063,And she was on the ground.
1064,And I remember...
1065,I remember she looked really scared...
1066,because she was about to see what happens after you die.
1067,And I know who did it.
1068,What?
1069,"Starr, you never told us that."
1070,It was a King Lord.
1071,He missed me once...
1072,"and I didn't want to give him another chance, so I didn't snitch."
1073,And then I heard a few months later that he got killed.
1074,So I didn't say anything.
1075,"Now tell me, Miss Ofrah..."
1076,what kind of friend is that?
1077,"You can't blame yourself for that, Starr."
1078,You were young.
1079,You are young.
1080,I wanna be a better friend for Khalil.
1081,But goin' on TV...
1082,I don't know about all that.
1083,"Well, if you ever need legal advice or..."
1084,you change your mind...
1085,I'm here.
1086,Thank you.
1087,Yeah!
1088,"No, school, guys!"
1089,Come on!
1090,Let's go!
1091,"Yo, let's go!"
1092,Let's go!
1093,Don't run in the halls!
1094,"Jackson, slow it down!"
1095,"Hey, what is going on?"
1096,School's out. Protesting's in.
1097,And I was so ready for that history test this morning.
1098,Hey!
1099,Where have you been?
1100,"Everyone's ditching, girl."
1101,"Come on, let's go."
1102,Really? I thought you'd love this considering what you've been putting up on Tumblr lately.
1103, Love it?
1104, Well...
1105,"Not love it obviously, but, I mean, you care, right?"
1106,It's your neighborhood.
1107,I thought you might even know the guy.
1108,"I just don't think it's, you know, cool to use the situation as an excuse to skip class."
1109,"What the hell, Starr?"
1110,It's not just an excuse to skip class.
1111,It's a good cause.
1112,It also happens to be a really good excuse to cut school.
1113,I really don't want to see our math teacher's face today.
1114,Do you?
1115,Justice for Khalil!
1116,What? What's wrong?
1117,This isn't right.
1118,"Who else is gonna speak up for our people, girl?"
1119,"""Our people?"" Where are you going?"
1120,Starr?
1121,I've been looking for you everywhere.
1122,I don't feel well.
1123,I'm going home.
1124,What's wrong?
1125,Hey.
1126,"You knew him, didn't you?"
1127,The kid who got killed.
1128,"Nah. Just give me some space, okay?"
1129,Why won't you tell me what's going on?
1130,Starr?
1131,Hey. Can you come get me?
1132, Hey.
1133, Hey.
1134,"Cramps, huh?"
1135,Yeah. People cramps.
1136, Be well.
1137," Thanks, Unc."
1138,"So, just 'cause some dumb, privileged white kids skip class, you think it's okay for you to leave school, too?"
1139,"Well, guess what, Starr."
1140, It is what it is.
1141," I know, Mama."
1142,But they're acting like Khalil was murdered just so that they can skip a chem test.
1143,And I didn't do anything about it.
1144,Mama...
1145,I need to speak for him.
1146,Let me guess.
1147,You're Starr.
1148,Yeah.
1149,"Starr, thank you so much for having the courage to do this."
1150,You're welcome.
1151,Diane's very excited to have you.
1152,We even bumped a segment to make sure yours airs tonight.
1153,And you're sure the thing we talked about is happening?
1154,It's arranged.
1155,They've agreed to blur Starr's face.
1156,No one watching will ever know it's her.
1157,"You are the only witness to the shooting death of a young, unarmed black man by a police officer."
1158,"Now, millions of people across the country have heard the name Khalil Harris."
1159,Who was he to you?
1160,"We knew each other since we were babies but if he was here, he would probably say..."
1161,"that he was actually five months, two weeks, and one day older than me."
1162,He was a kid.
1163,Yep.
1164,What do you think about the people that are only focusing on the notsogood aspects of Khalil?
1165,That he sold drugs.
1166,"Well, if they knew why, then they wouldn't talk about him like that."
1167,Why did he sell them?
1168,"Khalil's mom loved him, but she was an addict so there was no one to bring in money to help his little brother and his grandma who has cancer."
1169,So he had to take the only available job in the neighborhood that would pay him enough to help them.
1170,Available job?
1171,Dealing for the biggest drug dealers in Garden Heights.
1172,The King Lords.
1173,So there's one gang that controls your entire neighborhood?
1174,Tell me about that.
1175,Why are you only asking me about that?
1176,"I mean, next week, I'll be called to testify in a grand jury investigation, but no one wants to know what actually happened."
1177,Everyone wants to know what Khalil did.
1178,"What he said, what he didn't do."
1179,Like it's his fault.
1180,I didn't know that a dead person could be charged with his own murder.
1181,If Officer Macintosh were sitting here now...
1182,what would you say to him?
1183,"I'd ask him if he wished that he shot me, too."
1184, Here we go!
1185," Checkin' in, bro?"
1186,Yeah. I might.
1187,"Yeah, it makes sense."
1188,I know.
1189,Y'all need anything else?
1190,"Nah, I think we got everything we need right here."
1191,Ugh.
1192,Y'all really gotta be booed up like that?
1193,How else you think I pulled her?
1194,I know how.
1195,Mama!
1196,"See, we did not need all of that."
1197,I'm scarred for life.
1198,"All right, y'all, circle up."
1199,All right.
1200,"Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for blessing this food  and this family."
1201, Hmm.
1202,And thank you for allowing Starr to shine today.
1203,"Yes, Lord, and please help her stay focused on her studies."
1204,Thank you for my family.
1205,That's what I was gonna say.
1206,Me too.
1207,Amen.
1208, Amen.
1209, Amen.
1210, Amen.
1211," Eat the greens first, man."
1212, Hey.
1213, Need that hot sauce.
1214, Vegetables. Vegetables.
1215, Think about it at least.
1216, And compare it to the hot sauce?
1217, Yeah...
1218,No. Mnhmnh.
1219,I like the Tabasco.
1220,"Are you gonna ask for more sugar, like always?"
1221,It's really good.
1222,Why are you worried about my sugar?
1223,Let me taste that.
1224,"See, you put hot sauce."
1225,That's why I said it needs Tabasco.
1226,Yeah.
1227,This ain't hot enough right here.
1228,I'll try it though.
1229,"What, you don't want to, baby?"
1230,Put a little bit of the yam.
1231,Lisa.
1232,Stay here.
1233,"Hey, Starr did some real stupid shit today."
1234,"Keep my kids out your mouth, King."
1235,Your hard head makes for a soft ass whoopin'.
1236,You comin' close to gettin' your own.
1237,"Well, why don't you try it?"
1238,Stay!
1239,"Hey, why don't you..."
1240,"Hey, come on!"
1241,You got a problem here?
1242,"No, sir, Officer."
1243,What was that?
1244,I'm just having dinner with my family.
1245,Until you came out to score?
1246,"All right, come on. Let's go."
1247,Lean against the wall.
1248,"It's okay, Sekani."
1249,"Starr, you breathe."
1250,"Just breathe, okay, baby?"
1251," All right, he's clean."
1252, Take out your ID.
1253, My wife has my wallet.
1254, Where is she?
1255,Get my wallet!
1256, Stop.
1257, Daddy?
1258,It's okay!
1259,"All right, I got it right here, Officer."
1260,Maverick Carter.
1261,Sound familiar?
1262,Go back inside now.
1263,"No, thank you, Officer."
1264,I will wait right here until you release my husband.
1265,I said go back inside.
1266,"No, sir. My father didn't do anything wrong."
1267, Show me your ID.
1268, He is a child!
1269,Do you want to see his school ID or his learner's permit?
1270,"Ma'am, go back inside..."
1271, He didn't do anything!
1272," All right, that's it."
1273,I know you saw that car drive away.
1274,I know you saw that car drive off.
1275,You saw that guy drive off!
1276," Why don't you talk to him, huh?"
1277," No! No! Sekani, go inside!"
1278,"Put that down, now!"
1279,I have a right to record this.
1280,She's the witness.
1281,"Yeah, we see y'all."
1282,"And all these cameras do, too!"
1283,Go on and show everybody how y'all really treat us.
1284,Let's go.
1285,Consider this a warning.
1286,You okay? You okay?
1287,Y'all get y'all stuff and let's go.
1288,Okay.
1289,You okay?
1290,You okay?
1291,"All right, come on."
1292,Come on.
1293,Let's get Sekani.
1294,"Oh, baby."
1295,"I'm so sorry, Daddy."
1296,This is my fault.
1297,I never should have gone on TV.
1298,I should've stayed quiet.
1299,"Everybody, get up out the car."
1300,Get out the car and line up on the grass.
1301,Point seven of the TenPoint Program. Say it.
1302,Stop crying and say it!
1303,"""We want an immediate end to police brutality."" Finish it."
1304,"""And the murder of Black people and people of color and oppressed people.""  By what means?"
1305, By any means necessary.
1306, By what means?
1307, By any means necessary.
1308, By what means?
1309, By any means necessary.
1310,So why you gonna be quiet?
1311,What does that say?
1312,"""Reasons to live give reasons to die."" Yeah."
1313,"You, your brothers..."
1314,and your mother...
1315,are my reasons to live and die.
1316,I gave each of you power in your names.
1317,Seven: perfection.
1318,Starr: light.
1319,Sekani: joy.
1320,Use it!
1321,So when you ready to talk...
1322,you talk.
1323,Don't ever let nobody make you be quiet.
1324,Are you kidding me?
1325,"No, no, no!"
1326,"Wait, wait, wait!"
1327,Threepointer!
1328,"Oh, my gosh."
1329,You suck. Whatever.
1330,Are you kidding me?
1331,I'm going to get you.
1332,What's up with you?
1333,Nothing.
1334,"What, so I'm trippin'?"
1335,You haven't said more than five words since we got here.
1336,I'm talking right now.
1337,What more do you want me to say?
1338,Why don't we just go back to the TV?
1339,Callers eligible must be 18 or older.
1340,...after the shooting...
1341,"Wait, can you go back?"
1342,Officer Brian Macintosh Junior has been on the force for five years.
1343,"A majority of those years serving in Garden Heights, known for its high crime rate, with murders up 15% this year alone."
1344,Officers have struggled for years to rein in the violence.
1345,"Changes in policies, gangs, and drugs have remained an issue for this predominantly African American community."
1346,Brian is a good boy.
1347,"People, they're making him out to be a monster."
1348,"He's afraid to go out in public, even for a gallon of milk."
1349,There's been threats against his life.
1350,Our family's lives.
1351,Wow. That sucks.
1352,That poor family.
1353,What?
1354,His son was only trying to do his job and protect himself.
1355,"His life matters too, you know."
1356,"Okay, um..."
1357,I need to...
1358,Yeah.
1359,Whoa. You guys haven't figured this out yet?
1360,Wait. Starr. Starr!
1361,"Maya, I cannot talk to her right now."
1362,That cop's life matters also.
1363,"Are you gonna be mad because I said that, too?"
1364,Yeah.
1365,Because you think that his life matters more than the person that you said you were protesting for.
1366,That's a problem.
1367,Problem?
1368,"Please, guys, come on."
1369,You unfollowed my Tumblr after the protest.
1370,Why?
1371,Was it the picture of Emmett Till that did it?
1372,Did you sympathize with his poor family before you looked away?
1373,"Okay. Maya, now she's calling me a racist."
1374,"Nah, I didn't."
1375,I just asked you a question.
1376,Unbelievable.
1377,You know what?
1378,"I don't know who the hell you are anymore, Starr."
1379,That's the real reason I unfollowed you.
1380,Damn.
1381,You can never go wrong with black.
1382,It is always so elegant.
1383,I swear.
1384,You are gonna look so beautiful for prom.
1385,"What's wrong, munch?"
1386,Talk to me.
1387,It's just me and Hailey got into it.
1388,Mama?
1389, What?
1390, You never liked her.
1391,No. That's not true.
1392,I never liked how you followed her around like you can't think for yourself.
1393,There's a difference.
1394,Like the time that you begged me to dye your hair purple. Yeah.
1395,I wanted to have purple hair.
1396,"No, no, no."
1397,No! Why?
1398,The real why.
1399,"Because Hailey wanted me, her, and Maya to have matching hair at school."
1400,That's what I'm talking about.
1401,Thank you. Right there.
1402,"All right, so what happened between y'all now?"
1403,It's just some of the stuff she says. It's like...
1404,It makes me wonder how we're even friends in the first place.
1405,"Now that's something, you know what, you need to ask yourself."
1406,If this friendship is even worth it.
1407,I'm just so mad that I don't know.
1408,"No, no, no. Wait a minute."
1409,You don't have time to be mad.
1410,You're behind in your schoolwork.
1411,You... You ain't ready for your SATs.
1412,You need to just forgive and you move on.
1413,Is that what you did with Daddy?
1414,After he got Iesha pregnant with Seven?
1415,You just forgave and you moved on?
1416,Yeah.
1417,"Yeah, I did."
1418,It wasn't easy.
1419,"And even though your dad and I had been broken up when he got tangled up with Iesha, it still hurt."
1420,But you know what?
1421,I had to decide. Me.
1422,If my love for your dad was bigger than his mistakes.
1423,The love that I share with your dad?
1424,That...
1425,That is bigger than everything.
1426,Even with crazy Iesha?
1427,Yeah. Even with crazy Iesha.
1428,"Listen, baby, if the good outweighs the bad, then you keep Hailey in your life."
1429,But if it doesn't...
1430,you let her go.
1431,Hey.
1432,"It's you, right?"
1433,You told me you didn't know Khalil.
1434,"Yeah, I knew him."
1435,Did you not think that I was gonna find out?
1436,Were you just gonna hide everything from me?
1437,It's not like that.
1438,"Starr, I'm your boyfriend."
1439,That's what I'm here for.
1440,It's not like I don't trust you.
1441,Then what's it like?
1442,Tell me. Please.
1443,"Chris, I don't live at Williamson."
1444,If I had told everybody...
1445,"I would've been ""poor Starr"" who saw her friend get killed."
1446,"Or ""Starr the charity case"" who lives in the ghetto."
1447,Do you think people really care about where you live?
1448,"Yeah, I do."
1449,Geez.
1450,Have you ever seen somebody die?
1451,No.
1452,"Well, I have twice now."
1453,That's why my parents put me and my brothers in Williamson.
1454,To protect us.
1455,And now...
1456,it's like I have to hide who I am every single day.
1457,"When I'm at home, I can't be too Williamson."
1458,"When I'm here, I can't act too Garden Heights."
1459,Khalil was my first crush.
1460,My first kiss.
1461,And he was going through so much shit...
1462,and I didn't even know...
1463,because I turned my back on him.
1464,I turned my back on all of my people.
1465,Do you even know what that's like?
1466,No.
1467,"And I'm sorry, Starr. I really am."
1468,"But black, white..."
1469,nobody gives a shit.
1470,We're all the same.
1471,But we're not.
1472,"Y'all wanna act black, but you get to keep your white privilege."
1473,You think playing ball and jumping in some lameass Williamson cypher makes you understand what it is to be black?
1474,It doesn't.
1475,"Starr, I just told you I don't see color."
1476,I see people for who they are.
1477,The exact same way I see you.
1478,"If you don't see my blackness, you don't see me."
1479,I see you.
1480,"Hey, y'all better not be doin' nothin'."
1481," Oh, my God."
1482, I ain't playing.
1483,Seven!
1484,"Aw, baby."
1485,I'm sorry prom got ruined.
1486,You kidding me? I don't give a shit about prom.
1487,What I do give a shit about are the burgers we're gonna eat after prom.
1488,And the milkshake.
1489,And the next part.
1490,What next part?
1491,I'm gonna take you home...
1492,and I'm gonna meet your father.
1493,I suggest you get some color real quick.
1494,"I've got color on the inside, where it counts."
1495,"All right, man."
1496,"Well, uh, I think it's time we test your black card."
1497,What you want for Thanksgiving?
1498,Sweet potato pie...
1499,or pumpkin?
1500,Sweet potato pie. All day.
1501, Ding! Ding! Ding!
1502, Okay.
1503, That's my baby right there.
1504, Okay. Hold up.
1505, He knows what's up.
1506, We're not done.
1507,Mac and cheese.
1508,Full meal or side dish?
1509,Full meal.
1510," Whomp, whomp, whomp!"
1511, What?
1512,"Mac and cheese ain't no full meal, man."
1513, Mnhmnh.
1514, It's a meal out of a box.
1515,"Oh, no, baby. No."
1516,"It comes out the oven, bubbly,  cheesy, crispy on top."
1517, Yeah. Preach.
1518,Macaroni and cheese is a protein.
1519,You sprinkle breadcrumbs on top of it.
1520, Breadcrumbs?
1521, You have to what?
1522,"Oh, hell no. No."
1523,That ain't gonna cut it.
1524,Y'all both dead. Excuse me.
1525," Hey, Pops."
1526," What's up, man?"
1527,Hey. Thanks for bringing 'em home.
1528,Here you go.
1529,"Oh, Daddy, he doesn't need a tip."
1530,What? You gotta tip the chauffeur.
1531,"Hey, man. You better get out of here before someone steal your ride."
1532,Hey! Come in! Come in!
1533," Hey, baby."
1534, Hi.
1535,Chris! It's so nice to finally meet you!
1536,How was prom?
1537,It was good. Yeah.
1538,We came back a little early.
1539,Who's this?
1540,"Daddy, this is Chris."
1541,Who's Chris?
1542,Chris is my boyfriend.
1543,You got a boyfriend?
1544,"Well, who do you think she went to prom with?"
1545,"It's nice to meet you, Mr. Carter."
1546,You got a white boyfriend?
1547,"Uh, Daddy, he's not my white boyfriend."
1548,He's just my boyfriend.
1549,That boy is white.
1550,"Well, um, I'm sure everybody's tired."
1551,"Thank you so much, Chris, for getting 'em home safe."
1552,And you know what?
1553,I really look forward to seeing more of you soon.
1554," No problem, Mrs. Carter."
1555, Yeah.
1556,"Good night, Mr. Carter."
1557," Good night, Starr."
1558, Good night.
1559,Yeah. Good night.
1560,You knew about this boy?
1561,You knew about this?
1562,Who the hell else knew about this?
1563,Hold up.
1564,Does Sekani know about this?
1565,"What the hell, Starr?"
1566,"You got a white boyfriend, everybody know but me?"
1567,I wonder why that is.
1568,What's this boy's name?
1569,Chris.
1570,Chris?
1571,What kinda plainass name is that?
1572,Girls usually go with boys who look like their daddy.
1573,Guess I ain't set a good example of a black man for you.
1574,"No, you didn't."
1575,You set a good example of what a man should be.
1576,Duh.
1577,"If this li'l boy got you saying ""duh""..."
1578,he might have to go.
1579,Get down!
1580,"Wait! No, no, no! Maverick!"
1581,Tell Starr to keep her mouth shut! Damn bitch!
1582,Damn it!
1583,Hey.
1584,Hey.
1585,Come on inside.
1586,What are you doing? Come in.
1587,I'm goin' back.
1588,What?
1589,Nobody messes with my family.
1590,Especially not King's boys.
1591,Your family is here!
1592,And this family is moving.
1593,I don't wanna hear another word about it.
1594,We're moving!
1595,I'm going with Daddy.
1596,"Seven, get back in the house!"
1597,"Maverick, I am begging you."
1598,Don't go back.
1599,What if King comes back?
1600,I hope he does.
1601,Maverick!
1602,"Maverick, you promised!"
1603,Daddy!
1604,The eyewitness to the shooting of Lhalil Harris is set to testify tomorrow before the grand jury.
1605,Local community leaders fear that the testimony of the witness will not only increase gang violence but also amplify tension between local police and the Garden Heights community.
1606,Someone's trying to scare you about the grand jury tomorrow.
1607,Did it work?
1608,Why do we need a grand jury to decide if this should go to trial?
1609,Some people don't see what happened to Khalil as a crime.
1610,They see it as a traffic stop gone wrong.
1611,How?
1612,A lot goes through a cop's mind when they pull someone over.
1613,Especially if they have to get into a pissing contest with the driver about why they stopped him.
1614,It sets off an alarm.
1615,The officer thinks...
1616,"""Are they hiding somethin'?"
1617,"Is the car stolen?"" Now, if there's a girl in the passenger seat like you..."
1618,"""Does she look all right?"
1619,"Has she been beaten or raped?"" If they start talking to each other and not the officer, we figure they might be trying to distract."
1620,What are they hiding in the car?
1621,Drugs? A weapon?
1622,"Now, if the driver starts to insult the officer, we try to verbally get control of the situation."
1623,"But if they still don't comply, then we... we have to use force."
1624,But you still don't know if they did anything wrong.
1625,That's why we search them.
1626,To make sure that they don't have a weapon.
1627,We run their license and instruct them not to move.
1628,But if they open the door...
1629,"or reach through an open window, they're probably goin' for a weapon."
1630,So if I think I see a gun...
1631,I don't hesitate. I shoot.
1632,You shoot?
1633,Because you think you see a gun?
1634,You don't say something first?
1635,"Like, ""Put your hands up""?"
1636,It depends.
1637,Is it night? Can I see?
1638,Am I on duty alone?
1639,What if you were in a white neighborhood?
1640,"And it was a white man wearing a suit, driving a Mercedes?"
1641,"He could be a drug dealer, right?"
1642,He could.
1643,So if you saw him...
1644,reach into the window...
1645,and you thought that you saw a gun...
1646,would you shoot him?
1647,"Or would you say, ""Put your hands up""?"
1648,"I'd say, ""Put your hands up."" Do you hear what you just said?"
1649,"We live in a complicated world, Starr."
1650,"No. No, it doesn't seem that complicated to me."
1651,I'll be out here the whole time.
1652,"And if you need to ask me anything, that's your right."
1653,And your parents will be here waiting.
1654,Mmhmm. Okay.
1655,I love you so much.
1656,I love you.
1657,Now state your name for the grand jurors.
1658,"My name is Starr Amara Carter, and I'm 16 years old."
1659,I'm going to be asking you for a factual account of what you saw the night Khalil Harris was killed.
1660,I will tell you everything.
1661,I will tell you everything and more.
1662,Khalil lost his mother to crack.
1663,Khalil loved to sing even though he couldn't.
1664,Khalil ate at our house for five years.
1665,Khalil never cried.
1666,Khalil wanted to go to Egypt.
1667,Khalil kissed me twice.
1668,Once on that night.
1669,Khalil didn't own a gun.
1670,Khalil owned a hairbrush.
1671,Khalil died holding his hairbrush.
1672,And if Khalil was still alive...
1673,he would be graduating high school.
1674,"So, I guess you're not gonna get over it anytime soon?"
1675,Get over it?
1676,Yes. Get over it.
1677,"You can't even see that you're acting racist, huh?"
1678,'Cause I'm not.
1679,"It's all ""our,"" and ""us,"" and ""black lives matter, girl"" until you clutch your purse when you're in the elevator with a black person."
1680,"You don't need to use the Nword and use a fire hose on black people to be racist, Hailey."
1681,"You're different, Starr."
1682,I'm different?
1683,"What, I'm the nonthreatening black girl?"
1684,Yeah. You are.
1685,Your friend wasn't.
1686,He was a drug dealer.
1687,Someone was probably gonna kill him eventually.
1688,"Are you serious, Hailey?"
1689,Yes. The officer did see a weapon.
1690, He saw a hairbrush.
1691, That looked like a weapon.
1692,What's this in my hand right now?
1693,You're gonna tell me that this looks like a weapon?
1694,"In his hand, yes."
1695,What about in my hand?
1696,Huh?
1697,Huh? Does it look like a weapon?
1698,Does it look like a weapon now?
1699,Get on the ground! Now!
1700,Down on the ground before I shoot you!
1701,Don't move!
1702,Don't move before I shoot you with it!
1703,What the hell did I just say?
1704,Don't move! Hailey.
1705,Look at me and stop crying.
1706,That's what it's like.
1707,Starr.
1708,"Hey. Starr, wait."
1709," Starr, wait!"
1710, What do you want?
1711,Hold on!
1712,Starr.
1713,Stop.
1714,"Starr. Starr, stop."
1715,You're gonna hurt yourself.
1716,Come here. Come here.

1724,Y'all leave before King comes back.
1725,He's looking for you.
1726,"Nah, Seven. We're leaving."
1727,"Come on, help me out."
1728,Come on. Let's go.
1729,"Iesha, what happened?"

1778,Cop goes free.
1779,"No trial, nothing."
1780,The grand jury didn't indict.
1781,Starr?
1782,They killed Khalil for nothing!
1783, Burn it down!
1784, We want justice for Khalil!
1785, They keep killing us!
1786, Gonna arrest me? Then do it!
1787,"No, Lyric shouldn't be here."
1788,"Yeah, come on, Lyric."
1789,Let's get outta here.
1790,"Seven, you need to get outta here, too."
1791,"No, I'm staying right here."

1987,"Starr Amara, I know you are getting these messages. Call me!"
1988,"Oh, so you can't return my calls, but you can lead protests and throw tear gas on TV?"
1989,"I swear, I am going to snatch the life out of you if you don't call me!"

2055,Look at Sekani.
2056,He's the little infant.
2057,The result of hate.
2058,And he's about to fuck everybody.
2059,It's not the hate you give.
2060,It's the hate we give.
2061,But we can break the cycle.
2062,No!
2063,How many of us have to die before y'all get it?
2064,No more.

2071,Let's go home.
2072,"""Rebuild."" The riots weren't more than two hours behind us before Daddy said those words."
2073,And I knew we would.
2074,Especially with King going down for setting the fire.
2075,Everybody spoke up about what happened.
2076,"Mr. Reuben, Mr. Lewis, even Daddy said something."
2077,Snitch rules no longer apply.
2078,"Cops took down King, thanks to the whole community."
2079,The family's all good again.
2080,Even Daddy and Uncle Carlos stopped beefin'.
2081,Mama and Daddy said we're stayin' in Garden Heights for now.
2082,This is our neighborhood.
2083,Our home.
2084, Baby?
2085, What?
2086,Space it out a little bit more.
2087,You have 'em too close.
2088,"No, it's fine."
2089,"Honestly, really, it's fine."
2090,You doin' all the work.
2091,"Hey! Hey, man, what you..."
2092," Sekani, all right, stop! Hey, come on!"
2093, Stop sprayin'! Hey!
2094,"I'm gonna get you, boy!"
2095,Sekani's no doubt gonna live up to his name.
2096,Joy. He's still got it...
2097,somehow.
2098,Seven Carter.
2099,Seven's still perfect.
2100,Yeah!
2101,"That's right, baby! Go on!"
2102,"Next fall, he's off to college."
2103,Mama said forgive and move on.
2104,But I don't need a onesided friendship.
2105,Not when I have real friends.
2106,And Chris?
2107,We finally see each other.
2108,Starr...
2109,I'm cleanin' out Khalil's room.
2110,You go on in there and get what you like.
2111,Khalil.
2112,"I found out that name means something, too."
2113,Friend.
2114,I'll never forget.
2115,I'll never be quiet.
2116,I can't change where I come from or what I've been through...
2117,so why be ashamed of what makes me me?
2118,And I'm gonna keep on being Starr.
2119,No Version Two.
2120,Just Starr.
2121,Daddy says my name gives me my own superpower.
2122,To use it.
2123,And that's what I'm gonna do.
2124,Light up the darkness.
