31,Or buy a shotgun.
32,"Oh, please, Ms. Lam."
33,It's my property!
34,I won't have it!
35,Perhaps if you didn't provoke them.
36,Ms. Lam!
37,Ms. Lam!
38,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience what's that?
39,"sir, as the bard said."
40,"Shakespeare didn't have to deal with Alice Lam, though, did he?"

42,I want it.
43,"We don't have enough coupons for chocolate, sweetheart."
44,You'll have to wait till next week.

65,You've got the wrong house.
66,"Alice Lam, Dune Cottage."
67,"Yes, but..."
68,"In you go, Frank."
69,"No, you don't."
70,I don't want him.
71,You can't refuse.
72,You had a letter.
73,"No, I didn't."
74,You must have.
75,What did I tell you?
76,We've all got to do our bit.
77,"So you take him, I'm working."
78,I have four of my own.
79,More for you.
80,You should have been more careful.

82,Go on.
83,Get out!
84,No you don't!
85,"Oh, for pity's sake."
86,We're struggling enough to find families.
87,I'll need at least a week to find him somewhere else.
88,You'll have to take him till then.
89,I'm in the middle of a draft.
90,"And if you really can't find it in your heart to keep him, then bring him to the school next week, and we'll have to make arrangements."
91,But...
92,"A week, that's all."
93,"I'm sorry, son."
94,You're touching my things.
95,Don't touch my things.
96,I'm not.
97,Do you think you're funny?
98,What's for dinner?
99,You don't expect me to cook it for you.
100,There's the stove.
101,Need anything?
102,I always had milk before bedtime.
103,Good for you.
104,Bathroom's there.
105,Don't touch my creams.
106,It's my dad's.
107,"Pilot, is he?"
108,In 21 Squadron.
109,Do you like planes?
110,I hate them.
111,They murder my sleep.
112,He's got two medals.
113,What?
114,I'm supposed to go to school.
115,"Well, go on then."
116,Where is it?
117,I could not go to school.
118,I wouldn't mind.
119,You can't be stupid all your life.
120,Don't.
121,Sorry.
122,Ms. Lam.
123,What a pleasure to see you again so soon.
124,I want to give him back.
125,"Welcome to Saint Nicholas, my boy, best school in the country."
126,You'll be in Class Two.
127,Ms. Poskitt?
128,Why don't you come with me?
129,Go on then.
130,No one likes a coward.
131,I do hope he's settling in.
132,When can I get rid of him?
133,It's going to be terribly difficult to find him somewhere else.
134,Then you'd better start trying.
135,"Listen, I know you're busy writing your stories."
136,Academic theses.
137,Just wonder whether you might try.
138,He could end up further away from his mother!
139,This is Frank.
140,He's an evacuee from London.
141,Why don't we find you somewhere to sit?
142,"Here, next to Edie when she deigns to arrive."
143,"Edie Corey, one more late, and I'll keep you after school!"
144,"Be good, Class Two."
145,Mrs. Bassett.
146,This is Frank.
147,You can be partners.
148,"Be nice, please."
149,I don't believe in partners.
150,Spelling books out.
151,"Frank, you can share with Edie."
152,Or sharing.
153,Why not?
154,I'm an individualist.
155,"It's a person who shows independence of thought and, or action..."
156,Bristle.
157,I'm a maverick.
158,Hustle.
159,I just got told to sit here.
160,Mavericks don't follow rules.
161,Biscuit.
162,We're free thinkers.
163,"Edie Corey, spelling list."
164,"Crumbs, biscuit, tea..."
165,What?
166,"This seat is free, isn't it?"
167,You get stood up too?
168,"Actually, I came on my own."
169,"Well, not anymore."
170,Vera Wellbond.
171,How do you do?
172,What's that?
173,A secret.
174,Show me.
175,No.
176,What will you give me?
177,Show you up my skirt.
178,"No, thanks."
179,Wouldn't have anyway.
180,Who are you staying with?
181,"A lady, but only for a week."
182,Then I have to move.
183,Why?
184,Did you do something bad?
185,No.
186,"Still, least you escaped."
187,"You're 14 times more likely to be bombed in London than anywhere, and even if you don't die, it can burn your skin off so you don't have eyelids anymore."
188,My mum's in London.
189,"Oh, mine's dead."
190,"Oh, what about your dad?"
191,He's in the war.
192,So's mine.
193,We might get invaded soon.
194,Who says?
195,My grandma.
196,She said they might come here.
197,Why?
198,'Cause no one would suspect.
199,Probably here already.
200,"Look, spies."
201,They don't look like spies.
202,"That's the whole point, stupid."
203,I'll show you for a peppermint.
204,I've only got one.
205,Half?
206,Does anyone else live here?
207,No.
208,Do you have any pets?
209,"You think I should have a cat, don't you?"
210,Read them if you like.
211,"No, thank you."
212,Why not?
213,They don't look very interesting.
214,I wrote them.
215,Are they stories?
216,No.
217,"Analysis of folklore, science behind the myths, visions, witches, that sort of thing, women living alone with cats."
218,That's Italy.
219,"What do you want, a prize?"
220,What do you call an Italian with a cold?
221,It's a joke.
222,My mum taught me.
223,A joke.
224,"You say, ""I don't know."
225,"""What do you call an Italian with a cold?"" No, I say, speak when you're spoken to."
226,So...
227,So what?
228,What do you call an Italian with a cold?
229,I don't know.
230,Julius Sneasar.
231,That's ridiculous.
232,It's funny.
233,"No, it's not."
234,"Actually, it's ignorant."
235,"Italy wasn't unified till 1861, so you should say, what do you call a Roman with a cold?"
236,Tell your mother that.
237,"How are you getting on, son?"
238,"Not missing the bright lights, I hope?"
239,I know.
240,"You have rather picked the bad apple, got the thin end of the wedge, so to speak, the beast on the beach."
241,"No, forget I said that."
242,I'm joking.
243,You'll be fine.
244,It's hard leaving people behind.
245,You just have to keep your pecker up.
246,Could be worse.
247,How?
248,"There's adders in the woods, poisonous ones."
249,Want to come?
250,"No, thanks."
251,You're scared.
252,I'm not.
253,"I'm going to catch one, trap it, and make it into tea in case I'm abducted by a German."
254,What if he doesn't like tea?
255,Everyone likes tea.
256,Where are you going?
257,Back to where I'm staying.
258,No one lives up there except the witch.
259,What witch?
260,Race you.
261,That's her.
262,Do you live with her?
263,Yes.
264,She's mad.
265,Says who?
266,Says my grandma and everyone.
267,She sends signals to the Nazis.
268,"No, she doesn't."
269,She writes books.
270,Spells.
271,"No, folklore and stuff."
272,She'll make you her slave.
273,They all have them.
274,They make you work till you're all bones.
275,"Then when you're worn out, they burn you or do sex things to you."
276,She won't.
277,They'll never find your body.
278,Is that King Arthur?
279,No.
280,It's Morgan le Fay.
281,She was a sorceress.
282,What's Fata Morgana?
283,I thought you were digging potatoes.
284,They won't dig themselves.
285,It's a myth about how she lured sailors to their deaths.
286,How?
287,With visions of floating islands.
288,"They say she'd conjure them up to make sailors steer off course, crash their boats, and drown."
289,Why?
290,"Because she's a woman in folklore, ergo a temptress or a virgin."
291,"She's bound to get blamed for something, but it isn't just Fata Morgana."
292,There's all sorts of myths about islands floating in the sky.
293,Why?
294,People like to have something to believe in.
295,"It's what everyone wants, magic, or God, or something."
296,"Hokum, all of it, but people must have seen something."
297,Stories have to come from somewhere.
298,nasty witch.
299,Hey.
300,"Hey, I told you."
301,Clear off.
302,Get out.
303,Frank.
304,You're a Nazi.
305,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
306,Hold still.
307,I've got things to do.
308,Frank.
309,Are you a Nazi?
310,"Yes, I'm a Nazi."
311,I'm going to murder you in your bed.
312,'Course I'm not a Nazi.
313,Now come here.
314,Will it sting?
315,"Hey, you'll have to toughen up."
316,You want them to think you're a coward?
317,Why did they do it?
318,They've nothing better to do.
319,"Probably think it's funny, a woman living here on her own."
320,Why do you?
321,I suppose it's just the way it worked out.
322,Empty that before you spill it.
323,Vera Wellbond.
324,How do you do?
325,"Alice, as in Wonderland?"
326,"No, after Alice Evans, microbiologist, my father's idea."
327,"Oh, is he a scientist?"
328,He was.
329,I'm sorry.
330,It's all right.
331,"It's not though, is it, presumably?"
332,"No, not really."
333,Not really at all.
334,"Well, here we are, so I say, make the most of it."
335,What do you do?
336,I'm a history student.
337,You?
338,"Modern languages officially, but truth is, I'm writing a novel."
339,Don't tell.
340,I love this.
341,Let's talk afterwards.
342,I know just the place we can go.
343,You'll fall over.
344,Oi.
345,I can't make the wings stay on.
346,You think it's fun to play games about war.
347,I'm not.
348,They're too heavy.
349,"If you insist on doing it, you might at least do it properly."
350,You need balsa wood or cedar.
351,Go and look in the drift.
352,Is this for your book?
353,Mhm.
354,"You, yao..."
355,Yao Bay.
356,What are they?
357,Sightings.
358,he sees an island rise out of the sea.
359,The papers say it's a submarine.
360,It's got trees on it.
361,"Yes, look at the coastlines."
362,Yao Bay.
363,Yao.
364,They're the same shape.
365,Now look at this.
366,We're here near Ramsgate.
367,Notice anything?
368,It's the same too.
369,"Look, read this."
370,"""The cliffs between Dover and Ramsgate inca""..."
371,Intercept.
372,"""Intercept the view of Dover Castle""..."
373,"""Yet the people of Ramsgate ""saw Dover Castle floating above the sea."" Proof."
374,Floating Islands here.
375,Where are you going?
376,To see it for myself.
377,Where?
378,Ramsgate.
379,Can I come?
380,No.
381,Please.
382,Hey.
383,That's where they saw it.
384,There.
385,What happens now?
386,We wait.
387,For what?
388,Magic?
389,"Science, proof."
390,Have you ever been in a plane?
391,No chance.
392,Are you scared?
393,Do you always ask mindless questions?
394,Have you?
395,"Yup, with my pa."
396,What's it like?
397,"Really loud, and sometimes I couldn't breathe."
398,Weren't you scared?
399,Only when they shot at us.
400,Why are you lying?
401,I'm not.
402,Look there.
403,"Where, what..."
404,"There, right there, below the big cloud."
405,You're not looking where I'm looking.
406,Where?
407,It's there.
408,"Look, it's a tower."
409,Where?
410,It's there.
411,It's a tower.
412,I can't see...
413,Our floating island with a green flag on it on a turret.
414,"Look, a green flag on a turret."
415,"Look, right there."
416,Do you think this is a game?
417,This is my work.
418,Dover Castle doesn't fly flags.
419,"I saw it, a green flag on a turret. I'm not flying..."
420,You're not taking this seriously.
421,Where are you going...
422,We're going home.
423,It's not my home.
424,"Well, stay here then."
425,See if I care.
426,Frank.
427,Frank.
428,You really saw it.
429,"I'm sorry, Frank."
430,What are you doing?
431,It's broken.
432,"Well, what do you think we should do about that then?"
433,What if it breaks?
434,"All right, listen to me."
435,Life is not kind.
436,Anguish is inevitable.
437,Your heart will break.
438,Your friends will die.
439,You may even think about killing yourself.
440,"Planes crash, Frank."
441,What matters is how you deal with it.
442,What if it crashes?
443,What if it crashes?
444,I'll build another one.
445,"Well, then."
446,What are you waiting for?
447,Frank.
448,Worth it?
449,Yeah.
450,Why don't you have a husband?
451,Why don't you have a wife?
452,You think I need a husband?
453,Did you ever have one?
454,There was someone once.
455,Who?
456,It's in the past now.
457,Did you get married?
458,No.
459,Why not?
460,"What is this, 20 Questions?"
461,Can we have chips for dinner?
462,You always want chips.
463,"Thank God I've only got you for a few more days, or I'd probably starve to death."
464,You're missing the view.
465,You'll miss the turning.
466,Who cares?
467,I like this road.
468,"I care, V."
469,I'd quite like to get there in one piece if you'd only concentrate on...
470,"âª Where's that blue room they sing about âª âª Where's that sunshine they sing about âª âª I know morning will come, but pardon my laughter âª âª In each scenario you can depend âª âª On the end where the lovers agree âª âª Where's that Lothario you left the turning."
471,Look at the lake! Where are you taking me?
472,It's an older tree.
473,I always thought it was sacred.
474,I like your feet.
475,My feet? Why are you looking at my feet?
476,They are a very nice shape.
477,Why don't you paint your toes?
478,Why would I?
479,"'Cause, they're old and crusty and you might want to look nice. Like a normal person."
480,That's it.
481,"Don't go in, stay."
482,Do you miss him?
483,You are allowed to.
484,Do you miss your father?
485,I think you're remarkable to get by with no one.
486,Not no one now.
487,I saw a fish.
488,"It was right here, and then it moved really fast."
489,"Hello, are you a friend from school?"
490,This is Edie.
491,Hello Edie.
492,There's a letter for you.
493,Is there? Do you want to come in?
494,You're joking.
495,See ya.
496,Where is it?
497,On the table Any news?
498,Dad's got a new plane. It's called A Lucky Ventura.
499,It's got twin engines and it's blue.
500,And your mother? She's got a job talking to ministers Ministers? Doing what?
501,Doesn't say it's because of the war.
502,You should write back.
503,Put this in too.
504,What is it?
505,It says as I'm sending you back your pain in my side.
506,It's all right.
507,A couple more days you'll be gone anyway.
508,Where will I go?
509,"With a family from school I expect, much more fun."
510,Could I stay here?
511,I told you I have to work.
512,Less chance of that with you around Come on. We'll post it on the way.
513,Where are we going?
514,Tart hunting.
515,The floating islands in the clouds...
516,Is that like heaven.
517,"No, it's physics."
518,Some sort of mirage.
519,Do you believe in heaven?
520,Yes.
521,Well you shouldn't just made up by the Christians to make themselves feel better.
522,How do you know?
523,"Because if it was true, what happened to all the people who died before the Christians?"
524,Where did their souls go?
525,Summerland.
526,Where?
527,Summerland. Come on.
528,I know a shortcut.
529,Where's Summerland?
530,Here.
531,In Kent?
532,"No. all around us, like a layer that we can't see, until it gets disturbed by a restless soul."
533,So it's trying to tell us something.
534,How?
535,How do you think by disturbing the patterns?
536,"Look, patterns in the clouds."
537,"Pagans thought they were signs, from Summerland. Magic I thought you didn't believe in magic."
538,I don't.
539,Stories have come from somewhere.
540,"In the myth about Morgan Murphy, do you know what some of the sailors song?"
541,What?
542,"Summerland. If it's invisible except sometimes, like the island."
543,They're completely different ideas.
544,"Summerland's pagan, but Morgan is a myth."
545,"It could be the same. If its dead people make you sign, maybe Summerland is the island."
546,And if it's real.
547,"The islands a mirages, and Summeland's just a pagan heaven."
548,How do you know? Just because you haven't seen it.
549,Can I have her now? It's my turn.
550,I haven't had long enough.
551,Please?
552,What is that?
553,This is Molly. She's our rat.
554,We're taking turns to look after her.
555,She's not coming inside.
556,She'll stay in my pockets.
557,What happened to your shoe?
558,Edie slipped on the rocks.
559,"No, I didn't."
560,We'd better clean it up.
561,"No, You don't want an infection."
562,"Ow, ow."
563,This might sting a bit.
564,Ow All done. Better?
565,Yes.
566,Do you want to stay for dinner?
567,It's Frank's last night so I'm celebrating.
568,I'm not allowed.
569,Oh?
570,Well then. Another the time.
571,Excuse me.
572,"Sorry, sorry."
573,Can we put some music on?
574,Put it back.
575,What is it?
576,Put it back.
577,Hand me your plate.
578,"Sorry, it's just it was a gift that's all."
579,From who?
580,"A lady, a friend."
581,It's a good tune.
582,Was she the one you loved?
583,Why did you say that?
584,Would you think it was strange if a woman loved another woman?
585,No.
586,"Sorry, its not you."
587,"You didn't, its just."
588,Most people think it's wicked.
589,Why?
590,I don't know.
591,They think it's a sin to love someone we should burn in hell.
592,It's not as bad as marrying somebody you don't like.
593,Do they hug you? At home?
594,Sometimes.
595,Sometimes they just get quiet.
596,Did you kiss her?
597,How would you feel if I said yes?
598,Don't know Then yes. How is that?
599,Alright.
600,Was on the lips?
601,Mostly. Eat up. The stew is getting cold.
602,Tell me how to make your bed.
603,"Top two corners, Then?"
604,the bottom and then the other.
605,And make sure you put the pots away and write to your mother.
606,Always help with the washing up.
607,And?
608,Don't always ask for chips.
609,Ready for the big day.
610,"Good news, my boy."
611,We found you a family. Decent enough people that retired.
612,They live just up the coast and there's a place for you at St. Joseph's. It's not a bad school at all.
613,Don't want a new school?
614,Surely you can keep him here.
615,Well he can't go to school here if he doesn't live here.
616,This isn't what you said. Why did you lie?
617,I didn't know. Frank.
618,Frank.
619,Be good.
620,Come on. What do the stars have in store a down?
621,"Long life, good health, you meet a delectable woman at 22 and never look back again."
622,And this line?
623,That line says you ought to use cold cream.
624,And this one?
625,You are destined to be a fine novelist.
626,But first you have to finish your book.
627,What else does my palm say?
628,That's it.
629,What about family?
630,Can't tell.
631,"Al, why won't we talk about this?"
632,V  We need to talk about this.
633,I want a family.
634,What if I want to be a mother?
635,When will you come and play?
636,Ready to meet your new family?
637,You'd have to be on your very best behavior.
638,We can't be finding your new set when this lot give you the heave ho.
639,I'm joking. Come on.
640,You know I'll give you straight back if you misbehave.
641,Go and then it's yours.
642,What is it?
643,Why did you say I couldn't stay?
644,Thought you didn't want me.
645,Changed my mind.
646,"I'm sorry, Frank."
647,It's the truth.
648,I wouldn't lie to you.
649,Promise?
650,I promise.
651,Mr. Sullivan said it's your birthday tomorrow.
652,Can we have cake?
653,We'll see.
654,I'm hunting scrap iron.
655,Mr Sullivan said that they give us a penny for every box.
656,Wanna come?
657,Can I?
658,Go on.
659,Be back before it's dark.
660,"Look, what I found."
661,We'll get a penny for that.
662,I might run away soon.
663,My grandma's getting an evacuee.
664,"Might be good No, they're only getting her because I'm an inadequate offspring."
665,Says who?
666,I've read about it.
667,"They're compensating because I don't fulfill the feminine ideal, like mom did."
668,"I know because they ordered a girl, who would like ballet and everything."
669,I'm glad you don't like ballet.
670,You don't fancy me do you?
671,"No, bomers up?"
672,"No, I don't want another one."
673,Is Frank here?
674,He's out with Edie I need to speak to him.
675,What is it? I can tell him when he gets back.
676,What is it?
677,His father..
678,His father?
679,We just had the telegram.
680,He's not on his own.
681,You'll have to tell him.
682,Me?
683,I can't stay here all night.
684,"I, uhuh, his mother, she should tell him."
685,We've been trying to contact her but she is working for the ministry.
686,They're not likely to release her.
687,What if she telephones?
688,Telephoned? He's a child Miss Lam.
689,He has to be told probably face to face and looked after.
690,You tell him.
691,It's his birthday tomorrow. I can't tell him.
692,Do it tonight.
693,Guess what I got.
694,"Come on, guess."
695,What?
696,"It's bacon, from Mrs. Bassett."
697,I think it's because she felt sorry for me because I'm staying with you.
698,She does know I want to though.
699,Can we have bacon sandwiches and chips?
700,Yes.
701,Please may I have a birthday party. Edie could come.
702,And you and me.
703,Frank Do you think I could get a bicycle?
704,Edie has one.
705,"Look what I've got, all the way from south today."
706,What are you doing?
707,You said you'd give me time.
708,I tried to say but you wouldn't listen.
709,But I love you.
710,What can we ever be?
711,Two spinsters who can barely walk out together?
712,Don't you dare be a coward?
713,Childless?
714,The rest I can take.
715,"What people say, all of that, for you."
716,But I want to be a mother.
717,More than anything.
718,More than us?
719,Please don't.
720,I'm sorry.
721,Please don't do this.
722,I'm sorry.
723,What is that?

752,"Edie, You're coming with me. Come on."
753,In here. I need mushrooms.

756,Come on. Lets get going while the lights good.
757,Come on!
758,Come on!
759,"Mrs. Corey She's up to no good, and that's not right."
760,"Not when there's a child, you need to do something."
761,And until then I don't want Edie mixing with him.
762,I can't not go to school.
763,"Or Cassey, put him in another class."
764,"For God's sake. He's just lost his father, he needs all the friends he can get."
765,You didn't know.
766,Aircraft Carrier sank at the weekend.
767,Terrible business.
768,Did you have to tell him?
769,No Miss Lam did.
770,I hope she did it gently.
771,Bad news is bad news.
772,However you tell it.
773,There's nothing makes it easier.
774,I've got a surprise for you.
775,What is it?
776,You'll have to wait and see.
777,"Edie, we thought you weren't coming. We've got cake."
778,I'm Jenny rabbit. Come on.
779,Surprise! Who goes first.
780,Lets shake for it.

786,What did you get for your birthday Frank?
787,"My hat, I showed you."
788,I meant from your mom and dad.
789, Where did you say they are?
790," Spin me, spin me, spin me."
791,Edie.
792,"I told you, my mom is working with the ministers and my dad's got a new plane. Spin me faster."
793,Edie!
794,You haven't told him!
795,I was trying to protect him.
796,You're not his mom.
797,"Edie please, You're not."
798,Listen to me.
799,"You're a liar, a liar!"
800,"Edie please, please."
801,You're not right.
802,I promise it's his birthday. Please But you're lying to him when will you tell him?
803,"I'll tell him tomorrow, I promise."

813,But just let me do it my way.
814,"You mustn't say anything to him Do you understand? Edie? Edie, listen to me. Do you understand?"
815,Edie? Edie?
816,Why did Edie go home?
817,She was just dizzy.
818,Can I ask you something?
819,How come only I could see it.
820,See what?
821,Summerland. How come you couldn't?
822,Maybe I need glasses.
823,I think someone's trying to speak to me.
824,It's just a story. It's just a trick of the light Like a mirage in the desert refraction.
825,It isn't real.
826,"But if it was, if it was someone, trying to speak to you, someone who passed it would but mean, that they loved you, very much and they wanted you to know."
827,N is for not.
828,"Don't run, don't run."
829,"Go on, do what you like."
830,"Frank, Frank. I'm deeply sorry, Frank."
831,"If you need someone to talk to, I'm fine thanks."
832,Sorry?
833,I'm used to it now its all right.
834,You don't have to put on a brave face with me now chap. It's a terrible shock.
835,Can I go now?
836,Of course.
837,Do you want to go?

839,It's alright.
840,You could have my turn if you like.
841,Frank.
842,I was only looking.
843,It's your turn.
844,Supposed to look out for her.
845,"You're a suck, just 'cause you fancy her."
846,I'm not to a suck.
847,You are.
848,She's got inside your head.

855,"Shut up, shut up!"
856,She's not a witch.
857,She's a liar. You can't even see it.
858,You're the liar.
859,"She's a liar Frank, and you're too stupid to see it."
860,You're just jealous.
861,Jealous? Why would I be jealous?
862,Because you haven't got a mom.
863,She is a liar.
864,She's a liar because your dad's dead and she hasn't even told you.
865,What's are you talking about?

877,"You can't around turning up at people's houses Just tell me how you knew when they chose you, for Cassie."
878,When they chose us?
879,When they picked you.
880,"They don't pick you, you volunteer, We volunteered, like you did."
881,"Think carefully. Is anywhere or anyone he'd want to go to, other than his mother He wouldn't."
882,"There's a 218, to London but it's always late."
883,We need to run.
884,"Edie, why aren't you in school?"
885,Edie?
886,You haven't.
887,Haven't what?
888,"You haven't. Edie, you haven't told him."
889,Where is he?
890,Ms Lamb.
891,What is going on?
892,Where is he Edie?
893,You're certain he was on the train?
894,"Yeah, the station master said there was a boy."
895,"But how could he allow him on board, on his own, its policy."
896,"Look, this will take you hours to drive, and it isn't safe. There must be some other way."
897,Like what?
898,"Poor child, he could be anywhere."
899,"No no, that's my son."
900,Wait!
901,Hurry!

911,I don't know nothing ma'am.
912,"But the neighbor, someone must have seen, must know."
913,His mother lives here.
914,You'll just have to wait like everyone else.
915,How long?
916,It takes time I don't know.
917,Days most likely.
918,Six streets here in London last night.
919,"Tell you what. Leave your details, and go on ma'am."
920,I'm sorry.
921,"Everyone, find shelter, now! Now!"
922,They promised to telephone.
923,The moment they hear anything.
924,Frank.
925,She wouldn't want you to be here in London where it isn't safe Come with me for her.

936,Frank!
937,It isn't safe!
938,"You knew, and you didn't say!"
939,"I wanted to tell you, I didn't know how."
940,I felt it.
941,I saw him.
942,My dad in Summerland.
943,I saw him.
944,There.
945,Frank!
946,Frank Here.
947,Can I sit down?
948,"Frank, I'm sorry."
949,I lost my father.
950,He was on the Majestic.
951,One of the greatest ships in the fleet.
952,One of the hardest things was we didn't know how to grieve.
953,He was just gone out there.
954,War.
955,"You know, he loved stories of the sea."
956,Norseman.
957,"He said, when a Viking died, they lay them on their boat, set it ablaze and sent it out into the waves."
958,"The fire freed their spirit, so it would float away to paradise."
959,So we built a boat for him.
960,What sort of boat?
961,Out of paper and sticks.
962,We waited till it was dark.
963,Then we set it alight and let it sail out to see.
964,Watched till the last embers burned away.
965,I suppose it is our way of saying goodbye.
966,Go on.
967,"I know you might not be here, for long."
968,"But while you are, it's yours."
969,What sort of planes that?
970,Tiger morf.
971,"Once, I went in the cockpit?"
972,Did your mother know?
973,No. She's scared of planes.
974,She likes cars.
975,Do you have a favorite one?
976,Here.
977,Round or straight?
978,Round please.
979,Knock knock.
980,Sullivan!
981,I just wanted to check on the return of the native.
982,"Quite an adventure you've had, eh?"
983,"Miss Lamb, I wonder if um We need more sticks, would you go fetch some?"
984,"Yes, Um. I hope you don't mind."
985,I know what you're going to say. I know it was wrong.
986,But I couldn't tell him.
987,These things don't come naturally to me.
988,"Nobody knows how to be a parent, especially now."
989,We all just muddle through as best we can.
990,"Buy you two. Well, I never thought I live to say it but gosh, you make quite a pair."
991,He has a great deal to cope with now.
992,He's going to need you.
993,"You're doing a grand job, Miss Lamb."
994,Alice.
995,Alice.
996,Who would have thought it?
997,Yeah better watch out or they'll send you a whole train load.
998,"No, no, I absolutely can't!"
999,I'm joking. I'm joking.
1000,They wouldn't dare.
1001,You left the lights on?
1002,No I didn't.
1003,Mommy!
1004,Frank!
1005,Mommy.
1006,Hello Alice.
1007,We've been making a plane.
1008,What sort of plane?
1009,One like daddy's.
1010,It's for him.
1011,It isn't finished yet.
1012,"I'm so sorry, about your husband."
1013,Thank you.
1014,For keeping Frank safe.
1015,I just knew if anything happened to us.
1016,You were the only one I trust to take care of him.
1017,He could have died if I hadn't been so stupid.
1018,I'm sorry for you.
1019,"Al, you saved his life."
1020,Thank you.
1021,I'm sorry.
1022,"There was a tea cloth, somewhere."
1023,"You could use a handkerchief, like normal person."
1024,Bugger off.
1025,Are you rewriting again?
1026,He'll be here any minute.
1027,Well just go away and stop distracting me.
1028,I like distracting you.
1029,Oh.
1030,Look at this. I might enjoy this one.
1031,Not when you see how I've written you.
1032,"I thought I'd be the heroine, tracking you down. Like Pyro."
1033,"Oh really? You stumbled into a bookshop, make one call to a publisher."
1034,It hardly qualifies you as the Agatha Christy.
1035,Stumbled. There was nothing accidental about it.
1036,It was the 23rd shop I'd tracked.
1037,You never told me that.
1038,Come on.
1039,I'll catch you up.
1040,I finished it.
1041,Would you believe it?
1042,Can I have a look?
1043,Come on.
