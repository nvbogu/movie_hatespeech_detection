273,Do you think you are Superman? And the earth will stop spinning without you?
274,You are the one that stopped the earth from spinning.
275,What is that supposed to mean?
276,You are more concerned about the bad guys than me.
277,Let me ask you...

308,"I didn't mean to claim credit, but I did sweat blood on it."
309,But you also burnt down half the place!
310,"Environmental protection groups have been complaining to the chief superintendent nonstop, about how you ruin the environment and killed the birds there..."

550,That's my car!
551,"Hello, superintendent huang, I am Maggie, interpreter for the Japanese police."
552,I'm Chinese.
553,I studied in university of Tokyo.
554,"No, not university of Beijing, it's university of Tokyo!"
555,Excuse me...
556,I'm 22.
557,Excuse me...
558,Where is the best onsen? I like onsens too!
559,Superintendent huang.
560,"What's up, fallon?"
561,Very good. Everything is going fine.
562,Everything is going fine.
563,That's great.
564,Did you get the stuff I asked for?
565,"No problem  face masks, slimming pills, all on me..."
566,Hey!
567,But there is this one thing...
568,That's...
569,The suspect has got away.
570,He's got away?
571,Shit!
572, Listen to me...
573, How could he have run away for no reason?
574,Don't worry...
575,"The suspect is only 150 pounds, how could you let him get away?"
576,Do you want me to keep you company in the evidence room?
577,How could you put me in such trouble?
578,How could you?
579,The Japanese police are very capable and determined to get him back.
580,They promised me that they will get him back within the next 2 hours.
581,I will call you right away if there's any news.
582,You had better pray that they find the suspect.
583," Otherwise, you won't even keep your job  No problem..."
584,In the evidence room!
585,This is how good guys are repaid...
586,I will call you right away if there's any news.
587,Hello?
588,"Ouch... chief, thanks for the effort."
589,"Mr fallon, sit down."
590," Come on, come on..."
591, Did you find him?
592,Sit down.
593,Did you find him?
594,He is gone.
595,What?
596,He's gone? What do you mean he's gone?
597,Before tomorrow...
598,No... I cannot go back to Hong Kong.
599,We will bring him back...
600,"Trust the Japanese police, we are very very strong..."
601,No! I don't understand your english.
602,I will be demoted. I don't want to sweep the street.
603,"I don't understand what you are saying, interpreter..."
604,Maggie... come here...
605," They can't find him, what do we do now?"
606, Your bag.
607,"Hey, mr endo...!"
608,They say they've lost the suspect.
609,Why did you lie to me?
610,Damn you.
611,How did you know?
612,I told him.
613,"Let me warn you, fallon zhu."
614,I know where you live.
615,"Sir, listen to me..."
616,"If you lie to me, that's byebye for you."
617,I will update you if there's any news.
618,I promise.
619,"If I can't find him, I will not come back to Hong Kong. Ok?"
620,I got my bro Thor to help you.
621," If you need anything, let him know."
622, Sure. No problem.
623," If you don't have enough money, ask him for it."
624, I'll take care of it.
625,"Remember his name, it's Thor."
626,"Thank you, officer."
627,This is screwed up.
628,"Mr endo, this is not my bag!"
629,Excuse me...
630,Fallon zhu?
631,Who are you?
632,Thor!
633,Hello.
634,We finally got him.
635,Good.
636,Bring him here.
637,Sure. See you later.
638,My fart can come in handy sometimes.
639,It's so stinky!
640, You mean there?
641, The Chestnut stall is mine.
642,Is that iron palm?
643,Ganbade!
644,I will work hard!
645,It's not hot.
646,"They are never hot. It's fake, just for show."
647,"As long as we make money, who cares? Everybody's happy."
648,I live upstairs. Let's go.
649,How can they do that?
650,You don't need to do business like that.
651,What brought you to Japan?
652,I will tell you later.
653,I have been here for more than ten years.
654,Your boss dirty shing and I were buddies in the academy.
655,I used to be a cop in Hong Kong too.
656,My nickname was hard boiled.
657,Your nickname...
658,Is very famous in the field.
659,Dirty shing told me everything about you.
660,You don't need to hear it from him.
661,"Recently, I make the headline everyday."
662,It's a great place.
663,It's a good thing to meet you today.
664,How about returning the What 200 thousand yen?
665,He said you would pay me back for him.
666,"Last time when he came to Japan with a girl, I paid for all his expenses."
667,That's not right.
668,He said I can borrow money from you.
669,You know I have lost my luggage.
670,Damn! He is definitely messing with us both.
671,There's no point jumping up and down.
672,You've still got to pay me back the money.
673,No. I need to use the toilet.
674,Where's the toilet?
675,Why didn't you say so earlier?
676,In the corner over there.
677,Welcome.
678,Welcome.
679,Boss.
680,One beer please.
681,Sure.
682,This place is closed today.
683,I am here to look for the owner.
684,"All other people, get out!"
685,Welcome.
686,"Go get the sake, quick!"
687,I know you are here for the gambling money.
688,Please give me a few more days.
689,"You lost betting on the soccer games, you gotta pay for it."
690,Right now!
691,Please take the interest first.
692,Are you messing with me?
693,"You wanna close down your business, right?"
694,Can you be a bit more rational?
695,How can I make money when you mess up my business?
696,And how can I pay you back when I can't make money?
697,"Give me the money now, idiot!"
698,You idiot!
699,"You can take my life, but there is no money."
700,Tear this place down!
701,Go for it!
702,"Have some chestnuts, everyone, my treat."
703,It's delicious.
704,Please give us a chance.
705,Who the heck are you?
706,What are you doing here?
707,"Bastard, you can't hit him."
708,"Only I can hit him, you have no right to do that!"
709,Let's talk.
710,Go to hell!
711,What do you want?
712,What are you doing?
713,I'm sorry...
714,You guys can't even fix a kid.
715,Don't hit him anymore.
716,That's all I have. Please take it for now.
717,It's not about money anymore.
718,Stop fighting!
719,"All of you, stand by the wall."
720,And show me your ID card.
721,Who the heck are you?
722,Shit.
723,I have to lose some weight when I get back to Hong Kong.
724,Out of the way...
725, Hey...
726, Come...
727,You okay?
728, Fine.
729, The cops are here.
730,Just in time. Let's go down.
731,"Tiger, come back."
732,"These cops, they always arrive when the fight is over."
733,You watch.
734,Over to you.
735,Let's go.
736,You're kidding me.
737,That's enough...
738,"Director, so we finally meet."
739,I didn't expect to be on the same flight with you.
740,Not sure if that's my lucky day or your luckless day.
741,The film you were shooting that day was quite a form of art...
742,No!
743,Very good...
744,Cast your emotions on your son.
745,A little more emotion from the heart.
746,Action!
747,Don't! I will not give up my son.
748,Sounds like somebody is here...
749,Do you know how much one gram of this is worth?
750,What are you doing?
751,What's going on?
752,What have I got to do with anything?
753,Wait!
754,"Apart from the camera, is there any other evidence?"
755,I don't know.
756,Let's play a game.
757,You like baseball?
758,"Quickly, talk!"
759,You can't hide.
760,Wait.
761,I remember...
762,I remember my mum.
763,Bullshit!
764,Stop!
765,I put it in the rice.
766,Why are you hitting me?
767,I'm telling the truth.
768,Bullshit!
769,I clearly saw the cops and the gangsters were on the same side.
770,What has become of this world?
771,Where can you find the dirtiest cops?
772,The cops in Japan are the dirtiest.
773,They are on the same side from the start.
774,Nobody cares?
775,We have to operate our business everyday.
776,There is no other way except tolerating them.
777,Business?
778,The cost for repairing this mess is worth paying the debt three times.
779,You're such a busybody.
780,Thanks to your undesirable friend!
781,What are you looking at?
782,You think you've become a hero for saving my life once?
783,If you love saving lives? Be a lifeguard!
784,You're stopping the world from spinning tiger...
785,Come here! What are you doing?
786,No. I want to learn kungfu from uncle fallon.
787,You don't have to.
788,I saw your kungfu skills just now.
789,You are one heck of a fighter.
790,He is a good fighter.
791,Damn fighting...
792,Just now you just let people slap you around.
793,Why didn't you fight back?
794,How can you claim you're a man?
795,Madam...
796,You shut up!
797,Go!
798,Go!
799,Go!
800,"Tiger, come back here..."
801,Bye.
802,Auntie...
803,This is from uncle Thor.
804,Tiger is her nephew.
805,His parents were killed in a car accident.
806,So she wanted to stay in Japan to take care of tiger.
807,And wouldn't go back to Hong Kong with me.
808,"She also said since she could not give me a family, we should just break up."
809,You know women never mean what they say.
810,So I just stayed here with her and waited.
811,It's been 10 years now.
812,Why do you hold a cigarette in your mouth and not light it up?
813,She said I look really cool like this.
814,But then again she is afraid I would die from smoking.
815,So I always just hold it in my mouth and never light it.
816,I know your nickname...
817,Jackass of the century!
818,How can you believe the stupid banana daily?
819,Never ever believe it.
820,I've seen a lot of your celebrity girlfriend's performance.
821,Her acting skills...
822,"Different people, different views."
823,But she is quite pretty.
824,A girl with such a pretty face has no reason to fall for you.
825,Hey. âWhat?
826,Really...
827,Let me show you some real stuff.
828,This is me...
829,"Several years ago in prat Avenue, I fought that blond kid singlehandedly with just a Baton."
830,You should have heard of that before.
831,That's impressive...
832,Time for bed.
833,Sergeant zhu.
834,The Japanese police finally found yuji at Tokyo bay.
835,Mr fallon.
836," Good morning, thanks for the effort."
837, What's up?
838,This is your answer.
839,A dead body floating in Tokyo bay...
840,You don't think that's unusual?
841,We found cocaine on him.
842,"From our preliminary investigation, the cause of death was drowning due to drug overdose."
843,We found his suicide note.
844,He committed a crime.
845,"That's why he fled to Hong Kong, but then was extradited back here."
846,He committed suicide to escape punishment.
847,Mr endo said it is suicide.
848,That's it?
849,Japanese are actually very longwinded.
850,Ok.
851,"If this person wanted to commit suicide, he could have done it in Hong Kong."
852,Why did he wait till he was back in Japan to do it?
853,There's a Chinese saying...
854,"When the leaves turn yellow in Autumn, they will fall off."
855,The fallen leaves will return to their roots.
856,Home sweet home.
857,His whole body is bruised but not swollen?
858,The body has been found less than 8 hours.
859,Plus the water temperature was close to freezing point.
860,That's why the body is not swollen.
861,It's freezing cold...
862,"Dude, he was beaten up so badly that his eyes were crossed and lips protruded."
863,There's gotta be some injustice and grievance somewhere.
864,Drop the case. Okay?
865,Go back to Hong Kong.
866,Goodbye.
867,Alright.
868,Thank you.
869,Goodbye.
870,Mr endo your hat...
871,Get a new one.
872,Don't touch it!
873,So the Japanese police have found him at last.
874,Why do you care if he's dead or alive.
875,Go back to Hong Kong.
876,But you have to give me back the money first.
877,Don't always talk about money.
878,You are hard boiled.
879,Never give up so easily.
880,Do you know just how many yujis there are in the whole of Tokyo?
881,You've already knocked down more than That's enough.
882,Is this really that guy's house?
883,Let's take a quick look and leave.
884,I'm starving.
885,I'm sure I can find some lead.
886,There's gotta be a clue somewhere.
887,Did you find anything?
888,I found a banana.
889,What did I tell you...
890,Don't give up so easily.
891,Find something to hit it!
892,That's animal abuse.
893,Get him off...
894,Quick... hit him doggie... get out!
895,Don't make me do it the hard way.
896,Get something to hit him with. Hit now!
897,Why did you hit me instead of the dog?
898,He's got my butt.
899,Good boy...
900,Stay...
901,Stay...
902,Bad dog!
903,"Thor, are you okay?"
904,I'll live but my butt is messed up.
905,How long have you been a cop?
906,More than ten years.
907,And you are still in this state after so many years?
908,Why?
909,"For other people, ten years in the police force should at least be inspector grade."
910,Different people have different aspirations. I'm happy now.
911,Uncle fallon.
912,It's fixed.
913,Smart boy...
914,This cell phone had been soaked in water.
915,Most of the files that could be retrieved are saved in there.
916,But there is still a video file that can't be opened.
917,I need some more time to fix it.
918,Isn't this tsukiji?
919,I'm familiar with that place.
920,I can take you there.
921,"Thanks taiko drum group, for that great performance."
922,Let's give them a round of applause.
923,"May I invite the organizer of the event, mr shimakura to give his speech."
924,Chloe.
925,Isn't that... your...
926,Yes.
927,She does look prettier in person than on TV.
928,We are on a job. Please be professional.
929,Let's go.
930,The special guest today... miss Chloe song.
931,"Hasten up, why are you wasting time?"
932,"Hurry up, load the fish in the car."
933,Load it up there!
934,"One fish is missing, where did it go?"
935,Go find it.
936,How come I'm getting a little high from eating it?
937,What fish is this?
938,There's the fish!
939,This is delicious...
940,"Hold it there, you bastard!"
941,Stop!
942,"Are you okay, Thor?"
943,What happened?
944,Why did they beat you up?
945,Get down.
946,Thor.
947,Come on!
948,Thor! Wait for me!
949,Ready...
950,You ok?
951,Wake up.
952,Ok.
953,"You wanna fight, huh?"
954,Come on.
955,What are you doing?
956," Grandpa, let me handle this."
957, Fallon zhu!
958,Come on.
959, Fallon zhu!
960, Come!
961,What are you doing? Why are you here?
962,"I'm sorry, everyone."
963,There's no need to panic.
964,That's the fatty that was messing with us at kabukicho.
965," Chloe, we were beaten up."
966, I'm on a job.
967,What are you doing?
968, These are all Japanese gangsters.
969, What do you want?
970,They are all triads!
971,Police! Somebody help me... somebody...
972,Are you responsible for this?
973,He almost killed my grandfather!
974,You and this bullshit.
975,I'm gonna call the police.
976,I am Hong Kong police.
977,You're a bad guy. I'm a good guy.
978,I don't care what you say.
979,Can somebody call the police?
980,Chloe!
981,I know who you are. Just get out of my town.
982,"You think because you look like Nicholas tse, you can get out of this."
983,"If we're in Hong Kong, I would have arrested you already."
984,Moshi moshi wait...
985,I'm sorry.
986,Chloe... listen to me.
987,You listen to me.
988,He is my boss. I'm on a job here.
989, He is a gangster.
990, I know!
991, He's a gangster.
992," I'm just here to work, I have bottom lines!"
993,This is my first time doing a performance overseas.
994,When will you be happy? When nobody wants to hire me for a job anymore?
995,I don't want anything to happen to you.
996,Just hear me out one last time...
997,Why should I hear you out one last time?
998,Why can't you hear me out one last time?
999,Can you do that?
1000,I always listen to you.
1001,I always give in to you.
1002,I don't need you to give in to me.
1003,What I need is respect.
1004,Chloe...
1005, Leave now. I'm working here.
1006, Alright.
1007," I beg you, leave now."
1008, Alright!
1009,"Look, because we are friends..."
1010,I just want to tell you this...
1011,I don't want you to be involved with these bad guys.
1012,Okay?
1013,You think about it.
1014,"Thor, let's go..."
1015,Thor!
1016,He misses you...
1017, What are you doing here?
1018, EndoSan...
1019, Mr higashino... good to see you!
1020, Triads...!
1021,"Mr shimakura, how are you?"
1022, You are in on it together.
1023, Get in the car...
1024,Understood... I'll leave.
1025,I understand too.
1026,This guy is so troublesome.
1027,You're making everybody work overtime.
1028,Start the car...
1029,I'm so sorry... sorry.
1030,Our apologies everyone for this inconvenience.
1031,Everything's fine now...
1032,That was a troublesome guy...
1033,Mr endo said the higoshina group has decided not to press charges on you.
1034,About the drugs...
1035,The Japanese police have known it all along but there's no evidence.
1036,Do you believe me?
1037,It doesn't matter. This is Japan.
1038,I'm sorry.
1039,Thanks for bailing us out.
1040,Cut the crap.
1041,Am I really a 250pound cop that stops the earth from spinning?
1042,What I've always believed to be right are actually wrong.
1043,Am I Superman?
1044,Or am I the monster?
1045,"From now on, we can leave on time!"
1046,"If you want to save lives, be a lifeguard!"
1047,How could you put me in such trouble?
1048,Do you want me to sit with you in the evidence room?
1049,Go... Hong Kong!
1050,We have been together for more than 10 years...
1051,More than 10 years!
1052,I just want to have a stable life.
1053,Can you give me that?
1054,"There is much more in life that you can do, you don't have to be an actress."
1055,Right?
1056,And you have only one expression from beginning to end...
1057,Don't force yourself to go on.
1058,He is a gangster...
1059,When will you be happy? When nobody wants to hire me for a job anymore?
1060,We have been together for more than 10 years...
1061,I have to talk to you.
1062,Can you give us the space?
1063,Sure.
1064,Don't just walk away like this...
1065,Explain to me.
1066,What don't you understand?
1067,It's plain and simple.
1068,"I have to sell the restaurant, then move back to Hong Kong with tiger."
1069,So we break up again?
1070,"We have broken up years ago, fatty!"
1071,I've been waiting for you for more than ten years.
1072,"And all I get is a ""breakup""?"
1073,You are doing very well now.
1074,I see you are back in business.
1075,You ruined my restaurant two days ago.
1076,"And just today, you wrecked the fish market."
1077,"You wanna play ""hard boiled""?"
1078,"Why don't you sell the Chestnut stall, then put some panties over your head and pretend to be Superman."
1079,Do not insult my previous career.
1080,I was hard boiled.
1081, I wasn't pretending.
1082," Alright, I don't want to talk about it."
1083,The conclusion is  I will sell the restaurant and pay back the money I owed you.
1084,Then we don't owe each other anything.
1085,You think you just owe me money?
1086,You owe me much more than that why do you keep saying things the other way round?
1087,"Ok, let's solve our issues once and for all."
1088,Let's do it. Bring it on!
1089,You always boast about how good your chestnuts are.
1090,Bullshit.
1091,That blonde guy never takes his job seriously.
1092,"If I haven't been watching him all the time, you think your chestnuts would be so delicious?"
1093,And don't you think everybody loves to play mahjong with you the Japanese women on this street refused to come unless I paid them everyday to do so.
1094,They say you have the worst attitude.
1095, People line up to play mahjong with me.
1096, Stop quarrelling.
1097,Have you considered my feelings?
1098,What feelings?
1099,Alright.
1100,Don't do this.
1101,Okay?
1102,What's the matter?
1103,I've been there.
1104,Excuse me for being nosy.
1105,I really have to say this...
1106,This idiot is obviously crazily in love with you.
1107,"He may be a bit too fat, a bit too ugly..."
1108,No offence.
1109,But really...
1110,He's one of a kind!
1111,And as for you?
1112,I don't think you have no feelings for him.
1113,Or you wouldn't have helped him with his Chestnut business.
1114,"When he was beaten up the other day, you looked so worried."
1115,Everyone could see that.
1116,Right?
1117,I just wanted to say...
1118,In this world...
1119,No one can wait around for another person to love him for more than ten years.
1120,I am so right.
1121,Remember that.
1122,Fighting is part of the fun.
1123,Do not give up on Thor.
1124,"Hey, don't leave."
1125,You take care of them.
1126,Never give up.
1127,Right!
1128,You really sold the restaurant?
1129,At such a cheap price too.
1130,That's quick!
1131,What happened?
1132,Try harder!
1133,Hey.
1134,What do you want now?
1135,Let's go for some ramen.
1136,Cheers.
1137, Cheers.
1138, Cheers.
1139,Thank you.
1140,Chloe.
1141,Cheers.
1142,Cheers!
1143,Faster...
1144,Like in the movie?
1145,Like this.
1146,Cheers...
1147,Chloe.
1148,I have something to say to you.
1149,We haven't seen each other for so long...
1150,Let's not talk tonight.
1151,Let's just drink. Okay?
1152, Good.
1153, Come...
1154,I have something to say to you.
1155,About that night...
1156,I've been really thinking about the things you said.
1157,Which night?
1158,"That ""publicity your ass"" night."
1159,"Oh, the ""publicity your ass"" night."
1160,I know my limitations.
1161,Don't overthink it.
1162,I know I don't have acting talent.
1163,That's crazy.
1164,You are the most popular actress these days.
1165,The entertainment field needs pretty girls like you...
1166,With a nice body and great acting skills.
1167,You have so many fans.
1168,I know you paid them to be my fans.
1169,"Well, not every single time."
1170,I was just kidding...
1171,"Come on, let's drink up..."
1172,Did I say something wrong again...
1173,The truth is we love each other so much.
1174,But why do we keep fighting all the time?
1175,We didn't really fight.
1176,We were just communicating.
1177,Shall we start again?
1178,We broke up and got back together...
1179,Then broke up and got back together again and again.
1180,The problem is as long as you are still a cop...
1181,I would feel very insecure.
1182,"And when I feel insecure,  I will quit."
1183, I lose my temper.
1184, I will quit.
1185, Stop fooling around!
1186,I will quit.
1187,I can start a business like this.
1188,My two hands and legs are healthy. Why not?
1189,Right?
1190,You promise?
1191,I promise.
1192,It's a deal!
1193,It's a deal!
1194,"Deal, okay?"
1195, Sure.
1196, Keep your promise!
1197,Come.
1198,Cheers.
1199,Cheers.
1200,Cheers!
1201,Cheers!
1202,Cheers!
1203,Cheers!
1204,Cheers!
1205,Everybody okay?
1206,I'm alright.
1207,Is everybody okay?
1208,Thank you.
1209,You okay?
1210,Is everybody okay?
1211,Good.
1212,Everyone's alright.
1213,How come there's an earthquake?
1214,We should never come to Tokyo again.
1215,Are you hurt?
1216,Are you?
1217,Where are you hurt?
1218,Did you mean what you just said?
1219,"Yes, I did."
1220,You were lying.
1221,You can't quit.
1222,You won't be happy if you are not a cop.
1223,"In this world, there are lots of people that need good cops like you."
1224,But I am not one of them.
1225,Hello.
1226,"Fallon, what have you done?"
1227,Corpse floating in Tokyo bay...
1228,Melee in tsukiji market.
1229,When were you gonna tell me all this...
1230,After you wrecked the Tokyo tower?
1231,"No, listen to me shing."
1232, Shing...
1233, I'm not listening to you.
1234,Come back to Hong Kong at once.
1235,Do you want the earth to totally stop spinning?
1236,Moron.
1237,Did you hear what I said?
1238,"Listen to me, shing huang."
1239,I'd rather be a moron than be sorry for the rest of my life.
1240,"And also, nobody can stop the earth from spinning."
1241,Do you understand?
1242,You dare talk back to me?
1243,And you are the moron.
1244,"Boss, our informer said, what are you waiting for then?"
1245,Let me handle the tsukiji market issue.
1246,"I can fix it, grandpa."
1247,Just sign on this.
1248,"Shimakura, what are you doing?"
1249,It's ok.
1250,Crazy bitch!
1251,Bastard! Sign it!
1252,You'd better sign it for me.
1253,"Shimakura, you have gone too far."
1254,Sign it now...!
1255,Hurry up!
1256,Sign it...!
1257,Good...
1258,Afternoon...!
1259,I've come to say goodbye.
1260,Come here!
1261,You stupid bitch!
1262,Help!
1263,Help!
1264,"You know, you're only here because my grandfather loves you."
1265,But now he's dead...
1266,Bastard.
1267,Don't you know I'm a good actress?
1268,I'm a professional actress.
1269,How dare you called me a bitch.
1270,Bastard.
1271,"Uncle Thor, do you know where uncle fallon is?"
1272,I have been looking for him for a while now.
1273,"No, I haven't seen him."
1274,I fixed that video file.
1275,"If there's nothing else, I will go back to help auntie with her delivery."
1276,Give this to her.
1277,Ok.
1278,Do you know how much a gram of this is worth?
1279,Yes.
1280,"Hey, what are you doing?"
1281,"Boss, you're back."
1282,"Fallon, where are you?"
1283,We managed to open the video file.
1284,It really contains evidence of their criminal activities.
1285,Where's my jacket?
1286,Ganbade.
1287,"Hey, ganbade!"
1288,Why did you take my phone?
1289,With this phone I'm gonna be rich!
1290,I cook chestnuts for you everyday...
1291,You bastard!
1292,Speak Chinese!
1293,Try harder!
1294,Charisma.
1295,The phone contains criminal evidence of the higashino group.
1296,"With that, we won't need to sell the restaurant anymore."
1297,Run!
1298,The bitch has got the evidence.
1299,Go to hell!
1300,The phone and your gambling debt.
1301,Hand over to us now.
1302,"Charisma, you go."
1303,Go!
1304,Fry... fry...
1305,Charisma.
1306,Are you alright?
1307,I'm fine. I'm hard boiled...
1308,How are you?
1309,Wait!
1310,It's you again.
1311, Thor.
1312, I'm fine...
1313,Just got stabbed...
1314,What are you doing?
1315,I thought...
1316,"If I light up a cigarette, I will look real cool even if I were to die."
1317,Men that don't smoke are the coolest.
1318,Why didn't you tell me sooner?
1319,Charisma.
1320,What do you want to say?
1321,I think...
1322,You had better call an ambulance for me.
1323,I will make them pay for this.
1324,No one can be spared.
1325,Come on...
1326,Sir.
1327,You've arrived at the right time.
1328,"I know, I know."
1329,There was a big fight out there.
1330," No problem, not to worry."
1331, There's a big fight...
1332,Everything is normal. Let's wrap it up.
1333,Hey!
1334,Stop!
1335,Such a troublemaker...
1336,Who do you think you are?
1337,Are you Superman? No.
1338,You are little monster.
1339,Pocket monster!
1340,You're the monster.
1341,No! You're the monster.
1342,He's got to be involved in yuji's death.
1343,What?
1344,Really?
1345,You and shimakura are in collusion.
1346,You were a triad member right from the start.
1347,Do you have any evidence?
1348,You!
1349,Get back to Hong Kong!
1350,This is Japan.
1351,"Sooner or later, you will pay for this. It's Karma."
1352,"Then before Karma hits me, let me tell you."
1353,I was the one that planned out everything.
1354,I was the one that farted in the car.
1355,I was the one that handed yuji over to shimakura.
1356,Do you think you are Bruce Lee reincarnated?
1357,"Have you seen ""way of the dragon""?"
1358,What are you talking about?
1359,Bruce Lee is like this.
1360,You look nothing like him.
1361,Bruce Lee didn't wear a wig.
1362,I'm gonna report you to the supervisor.
1363,What are you filming?
1364,"You idiot interpreter, I hired you because it is beneficial to me."
1365,Stop doing meaningless things.
1366,You are fired!
1367,I quit!
1368,Ouch...
1369, I hate you!
1370, Don't you try to leave.
1371,Stop!
1372,That way.
1373,You asshole!
1374,Quch...!
1375,Come on...
1376,You little bastard!
1377,Stop!
1378,"Yeah, you keep running!"
1379,Stand still!
1380,Oh my...
1381,Karma...
1382,"Chloe, where are you?"
1383,"Sorry to disappoint you, it's shimakura."
1384,I want the phone.
1385,"If you don't get your ass over here, you're gonna see your girlfriend fall off the Tokyo tower."
1386,As long as she stays safe...
1387,Here.
1388,ChloeSan!
1389,ChloeSan!
1390,ChloeSan!
1391,Mr fallon.
1392,I'm glad you got my invitation.
1393,I've reserved this place for you.
1394,What you want is here.
1395,You bastard!
1396,Fallon!
1397,Fallon!
1398,"Fallon, don't die."
1399,Don't you die!
1400,Are you okay?
1401,I don't know what I'll do without you.
1402,"From now, on I promise I won't force you to watch my shows."
1403,I won't make you give money to my mom.
1404,What did you want to say?
1405,Say it!
1406,You are kneeing on...
1407,My private part.
1408,I'm s 0 rry 2 boss.
1409,I thought you were dying.
1410,I'm lucky enough the bullet just scratched the surface.
1411,ChloeSan.
1412,I am very disappointed in you.
1413,What do you see in this fat bastard anyways?
1414,What?
1415,What do you see in this fat ugly bastard?
1416,I'm fat?
1417,You say he's fat?
1418,"I like fat guys, so?"
1419,Yes!
1420,Yes!
1421,Look at you...
1422,You're like a little toothpick.
1423,"Yes, little toothpick."
1424,A little toothpick!
1425,"Yes, little toothpick."
1426,I don't know why you do this to me.
1427,I'm a Japanese yakusa and you're from Hong Kong.
1428,Why are you in my life?
1429,Go to hell!
1430,Are you bored of living?
1431,Chloe!
1432,"Are you alright, Chloe?"
1433,Be careful!
1434,Chloe!
1435,Come on...!
1436,Stupid bitch.
1437,Come.
1438,Hurry...
1439,Everybody at the restaurant!
1440,Please surrender immediately.
1441,The police will be in force shortly and you will be arrested!
1442,"Fallon, I flew in to Japan to back you up."
1443,Don't worry.
1444,"We will do this together as a team, bro!"
1445,"You idiot, you're finally here."
1446,"Maggie babe, why is the Japanese police so efficient this time?"
1447,Sergeant zhu uploaded all the criminal evidence on the Internet.
1448,"You know... CNN, YouTube, Facebook, wechat..."
1449,Everyone can see it.
1450,"You know the Japanese, they really like the face."
1451,But I really like my life.
1452,Can you slow down please?
1453,I'd like to stay alive for an onsen bath later.
1454,Watch out!
1455,Fallon!
1456,Catch.
1457,Come on.
1458,Fallon.
1459,Fallon.
1460,Fallon.
1461,Come on.
1462,Come here.
1463,"Be careful, fallon!"
1464,"Catch this, fallon!"
1465,"Fallon, beat the hell out of that little toothpick."
1466,Come on!
1467,Look behind you.
1468,Fallon!
1469,I'm dead!
1470,"Shing, are you okay?"
1471,Did you get your license from taobao?
1472,Taobao?
1473,I got my license yesterday.
1474,"Fallon, how much longer are you gonna be fighting?"
1475,"Quick, get it over with!"
1476,I'm having a lot of troubles here.
1477,Wait!
1478,"You lose, man!"
1479,I'm a toothpick...
1480,Please let me go.
1481,Watch out!
1482,He works for me.
1483,Ok ok... everything's fine..
1484,Stop talking.
1485,What?
1486,You told me to stop talking.
1487,Of course I know that.
1488,I was the one that asked you not to talk.
1489,So what did you want to say?
1490,So it is my fault.
1491,Maybe not every time.
1492,That's enough!
1493,Fallon.
1494,The Japanese cops will be here soon.
1495,"If they catch you, you will be interrogated till the next century, and you'll never return to Hong Kong."
1496,Let's get going!
1497,Let's go.
1498,"Onsen, here we come!"
1499,Okay it's ok...
1500,Don't be afraid!
1501,Just hold on to me tightly!
1502,I will never let go again this time!
1503,As long as we stay safe!
1504,Not too tight.
1505,"Don't choke me, Chloe."
1506,Don't choke me!
1507,"I see now that apart from straight lines, there are shapes like curves, circles and squares in this world."
1508,"As in our everyday lives, we shouldn't use just one way to solve every problem."
1509,"As long as we know how to forgive and respect others, fat or thin doesn't make any difference."
1510,It's like water.
1511,"Whatever shape you put it in, so will be the shape of water."
1512,Did the 250pound fallon zhu invent this metaphor?
1513,Does it matter?
