159,Mm.
160,Come on.
161,Mm...
162,You are the one who told me to wake you.
163,I'll just rideshare.

189,Are you gonna buy me a car when I turn 16?
190,What?
191,"You're kidding, right?"
192,No. Why?
193,All my friends get cars when they turn 16.
194,Ashley drives her car all around Beverly Hills.
195,"Okay, well, this is Lake Balboa."
196,"Sweetheart, when you turn 16, you can drive one of our cars."
197,But that's not fair.
198,Do you have any idea how much private school's gonna cost us?
199,More money than you could ever imagine.
200,That's right.
201,Why does it have to be one or the other?
202,Because your education is more important than a car.
203,Okay. Um...
204,"Uh, I need you ready in five minutes."
205,"Wait, five minutes?"
206,I can't be late for work.
207,"Uh, dad, can you take me?"
208,If you don't mind going through Lancaster first.

241,"Caroline Yeah, okay, fine."
242,Are we sufficiently far enough away from your friends?
243,I'm meeting them right here.
244,"What is it? Is it, is it the car you're embarrassed about?"
245,Is it me?
246,Are you embarrassed about me?
247,It's 'cause Ashley drives a Mercedes.
248,Brittany Emma!
249,She drives a Mercedes?
250,"Brittany Yes, mom, she drives a Mercedes. I told you that."
251,It's like the one Kylie has.
252,"Look, it's not a big deal."
253,A lot of kids in my school drive fancy cars.
254,"Mm, I get it, and you don't wanna be the one with a boring mom, who has the practical car, who's more logical and makes mortgage payments instead of car payments."
255,Thanks for the ride.
256,I'll see you later.
257,Caroline Okay.
258,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
259,What?

291,But we gotta get to my play date.
292,"Honey, you're 11."
293,I think it's okay if you're a few minutes late.
294,"Emma You're spying, aren't you?"
295,Caroline It's not spying if it's your own daughter.
296,It's spying.
297,Wasn't she wearing sneakers?
298,Where did she get those heels?
299,Emma She's snaky.
300,"Hey, uh, Brittany, is that your mom?"
301,I could've sworn I saw that creeper van at school the other day.
302,"No, that'sthat's definitely not my mom."
303,She's at work.
304,"Yeah, I took rideshare here."
305,Cool.
306,"Yeah, I use it all the time."

318,"Okay, time to go."
319,"indistinct chatter laughing Okay, so when are you gonna buy something?"
320,Everything looks so cute on you.
321,I don't know. I guess nothing is really just speaking to me.
322,Really? 'Cause everything is speaking to me.
323,Yeah.
324,So where do you live?
325,"Uh, like, up in the valley."
326,That area.
327,Hidden Hills? They have their own riding rings.
328,No.
329,Calabasas?
330,That place is so nice.
331,"I see it on TV, like, all the time."
332,I live in Lake Balboa.
333,"Hey, where is that?"
334,It sounds really pretty.
335,"Yeah, it is. It's, it's really an exclusive place."
336,Right in the middle of valley.
337,"Oh, cool."
338,"Well, hey, maybe we can have a party at your place some time."
339,"Yeah, that, that'd be great."
340,So where does your dad live?
341,"Uh, Santa Barbara."
342,I don't see him very often.
343,Why does he live so far?
344,"He actually wanted to live farther, but my mom wouldn't let him."
345,"He, like, hates her."
346,She took 70% of what he owns.
347,"So he lives far enough away where she doesn't come bugging him all the time, but also still kinda close so he can see me, you know, every so often."
348,"Wow. Uh, that's, that's bad."
349,What about your parents?
350,They've been happily married for 18 years.
351,"Wow, that's really weird, especially in LA."
352,I hope they're not staying together for you and your sister.
353,"No, I mean, I think they actually like each other."
354,Like a team.
355,"In fact, they love ganging up on me and making my life living hell."
356,"scoffs Brittany chuckles Yeah, well, at least they don't, uh, host your parties and try to take all your friends."
357,"Uh, it's true."
358,Everybody calls her The Party Mom.
359,That's cool.
360,"Yeah, they think it's cool."
361,But I don't know.
362,"I think it's kinda, like, gone out of hand."
363,I don't know. What do you think?
364,"Oh, gosh, I don't, I don't know."
365,"I mean, I wish my mom was more like that."
366,She's so straitlaced.
367,"Maybe if we close our eyes and chant over and over again, we can, like, switch places."
368,"Like, in all the movies."
369,"Yes, I love this idea."
370,Let's do it now.
371,I'm really glad we met.
372,"You know, us pretty girls have to stick together."
373,"Well, you're right about that."
374,Sale. Yeah.
375,"Okay, okay."
376,"Let's go, please."
377,"Ashley Come on, girls."
378,Gary So how was it?
379,Did you have fun?
380,Brittany So much fun.
381,Did you see that house they live in?
382,"Gary No, you can't actually see it from the street."
383,Is it big?
384,"Dad, it's not big, it's huge."
385,"I mean, they have beautiful furniture and an enormous kitchen."
386,"Oh, my gosh. The pool."
387,It overlooks all of Beverly Hills.
388,Sounds really cool.
389,Brittany It is.
390,So...
391,does a family that loves each other live there?
392,"Yeah, I, I guess."
393,"Well, I mean, her parents broke up a few years ago, but her mom seems to really love her."
394,"I mean, they go shopping, vacations, to the spa all the time."
395,It sounds like love to me.
396,"I mean, I never actually hear her mom saying, ""I love you."" No?"
397,I was learning about narcissism in school last year.
398,I think Mrs. Anderson might actually be the first narcissist I've ever met.
399,"She's that bad, huh?"
400,I don't think she cares about anyone else but herself.
401,Not even her daughter.
402,"But don't get me wrong, okay?"
403,She's a really nice person and I think she really loves Ashley.
404,She just doesn't show it like we do.
405,"Well, when we get home I want you to do something for me, okay?"
406,It's not my turn to take out the trash.
407,It's not your turn to take out the trash.
408,"indistinct chatter on TV door opens Hey, babe."
409,Caroline Hi.
410,There's dinner in the kitchen.
411,Thank you.
412,You're welcome.
413,"man on TV Doris, I'mI'm sure she's fine."
414,Okay? Thethe reception is really...
415,"Hi, mom."
416,"She'll call you when she gets reception, okay?"
417,woman on TV I don't know.
418,"Uh, it's not like her."
419,Mom?
420,Mmhmm?
421,Can I talk to you?
422,man on TV I will. Okay?
423,Don't worry.
424,TV switches off I'm sorry.
425,I'm sorry for making you drop me off at the other side of the mall.
426,I appreciate the apology.
427,Do you know why it hurt me so much?
428,No.
429,"Do you notice how your father and I, all the work we do around here, everything we do is for you?"
430,"Yeah, mom, I do."
431,I don't think you do.
432,"Yes, I do, mom."
433,Why wouldn't you let me meet your friends?
434,Are you ashamed of me?
435,"No. Mom, I'm not, I'm not ashamed of you."
436,You don't respect me.
437,You don't know where Ashley's family got their money.
438,"You don't know if they inherited it, you don't know if they earned it or if they have millions or if they owe millions."
439,"But what you do know, what you see..."
440,"are your parents who came from very little, who've worked very hard to build this."
441,"I know that, mom. I do."
442,"Just remember that when your friends have money, it's not their money, it's their parents' money, right?"
443,So just because they can buy a purse and you can't...
444,that doesn't make 'em better than you.
445,It doesn't make 'em smarter...
446,doesn't make 'em more interesting.
447,"Honey, I don't want you to get caught up in the Beverly Hills scene that..."
448,"All of that is not real, it's a facade."
449,This should be the most important thing to you.
450,This.
451,"Your father, your sister, me."
452,This should be the most important thing in your life.
453,"So you're saying that you should be the only thing in my life, that I should never leave the house, I should just stay right here."
454,Is that what you're saying?
455,"No, I..."
456,"No, I didn't say that."
457,So then I should get rid of the friends I have after I've worked so hard to get them.
458,Just throw them away.
459,No.
460,I'm saying you don't have to compete with them.
461,"You don't know what it means to compete with them, mom."
462,You don't know how hard it is with these girls.
463,"Oh, God."
464,"You just, just, you have to be strong, okay?"
465,"I am strong, mom."
466,I take care of myself all the time.
467,What do you mean by that?
468,"When you and dad are out working all day, I'm here taking care of myself and very often, Emma, too."
469,"So do not say that I am not strong, mom."
470,You're right.
471,"You're right, honey."
472,You are a strong girl.
473,Just...
474,Please don't fall for the peer pressure.
475,Are you done?
476,"Uh, like I said..."
477,I'm sorry.
478,Can I go now?
479,Sure.
480,See you in the morning.
481,Please don't forget to brush your teeth.
482,door shuts I was way too harsh.
483,"Oh, she's just figuring things out."
484,"Unfortunately, it won't happen overnight."
485,"Hm, it's hard being a parent."
486,Hm.
487,You're a good one.
488,Thank you.
489,Death has risen.
490,Shut up.
491,Emma...
492,"Honey, how'd you sleep?"
493,Fine.
494,"Uh, I can make you something."
495,We have eggs and bacon.
496,"Uh, we, uh, we have yogurt or, uh, well, we got the cereal."
497,And... chuckles You know what I have?
498,Hash browns. Your favorite.
499,I'm gonna make you hash browns.
500,"Yeah, I'll just take coffee."
501,Thanks.
502,Coffee? Only adults drink coffee. You're a kid.
503,I am an adult. Thank you.
504,Emma You could've fooled me.
505,Here. You can have mine.
506,I just made it.
507,It's fresh.
508,Thanks.
509,When did you start drinking coffee?
510,Today. All the girls drink it.
511,They do it so they can stay with their homework.
512,No... It... Just be careful 'cause it will stain your teeth.
513,So Ashley's having a party tonight.
514,Do you guys mind if I go?
515,You don't have to pick me up 'cause Ashley's mom said I can spend the night.
516,So do these guys ever stop partying?
517,"No, not really."

1082,gavel pounding judge The five of you were arrested in the last 24 hours and charged with crimes.
1083,You are here today for your firstappearance hearing.
1084,The purpose of this hearing is to tell you what crimes you are accused of and whether you are eligible for bail today.
1085,Today's hearing is not to determine guilt or innocence.
1086,"After review of your criminal record and the charges against you, the court will make a decision about whether to grant bail, how much bail will be or whether to deny bail."
1087,Does everyone understand?
1088,Yes.
1089,"Yes, Your Honor."
1090,Mrs. Anderson.
1091,Please stand.
1092,Yes.
1093,"You are charged with, ""Furnishing alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 and involuntary manslaughter."" Your warrant states that, ""In violation of State Code 3323 and State Code 1653, subject did provide alcohol to persons under the age of 21 at a party."
1094,"After which, four teenagers left the party and were involved in a fatal automobile accident."
1095,"Three of them died and the fourth is in critical condition."" Do you understand the charges against you today?"
1096,"I understand the charges, but this is ridiculous."
1097,Do you understand that the involuntary manslaughter charge is a very serious felony?
1098,"Yes, I am quite aware that involuntary manslaughter is serious."
1099,I'm not an idiot.
1100,"If found guilty, you could serve from one to ten years for each of the victims."
1101,"Understood, but that is not gonna happen."
1102,I am confident that I will be not guilty.
1103,"But because your criminal record is clear, I will consider granting you bail today."
1104,"However, the court has been informed that a parent of one of the victims would like to address the court concerning the matter of bond."
1105,Would the witness please stand up and state your name?
1106,"Uh, yes, Your Honor, that's me."
1107,I'm Caroline Thompson.
1108,"Our daughter, Brittany, is the only survivor of last night's car accident."
1109,"Um, II wanted to address the court regarding Ms. Anderson's bail."
1110,"You may proceed, Mrs. Thompson."
1111,"I realize, Your Honor, that her charges are not violent ones, that she didn't have a gun as a weapon, but II'm very concerned that if you let her go, she's just gonna go right back to serving minors alcohol and drugs."
1112,I object! I ob... I...
1113,"Your Honor, please."
1114,I object to this.
1115,This woman does not know me and she doesn't know my daughter.
1116,I don't know what's wrong with her.
1117,"She's had something against me for a while, apparently."
1118,She doesn't even know what she's talkin' about.
1119,Look at her. She looks like she shops at an outlet mall.
1120,judge Mrs. Anderson.
1121,Come on.
1122,You cannot object to a witness' request for a denial of bail.
1123,"In fact, you cannot interrupt the witness at all."
1124,"And if you do so again, I will hold you in contempt of court."
1125,"Please proceed, Mrs. Thompson."
1126,"Your Honor, I'm, I'm concerned that she's dangerous."
1127,I made a very big mistake letting my daughter spend time at her house that she almost paid for it with her life.
1128,"Judge, if you could just please keep her locked up until her trial, I'm, I'm afraid that she's gonna resume her reckless ways and she's gonna endanger other teenagers."
1129,And lives could be lost.
1130,"I completely understand, Mrs. Thompson, but because Mrs. Anderson has no criminal record and there are no indications that she's likely to reoffend, the court will grant her bail at this juncture."
1131,"However, to ensure that Mrs. Andersen returns to stand trial, the court will set a significant bail amount."
1132,"The bail will be $100,000."
