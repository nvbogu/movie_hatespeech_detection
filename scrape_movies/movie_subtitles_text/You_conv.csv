41,"Lucas, where are you going?"
42,Alicia?

84,Are you serious?
85,He ain't said anything about coming by here.
86,Lucas.
87,"Now, you know how he is."
88,Why didn't you message me and let me know he came by the house?
89,"Lucas, that's brother."
90,He just got out.
91,It's going to take him awhile to adjust.
92,That has nothing to do with me.
93,I can care less about any of that.
94,"Lucas, don't do anything stupid."
95,Yo.
96,What's good?
97,Get the fuck out of here.

136,You got it.
137,I'll see you later.
138,"And as for you, you better find my shit 'cause you best believe, I'm coming back."
139,I don't know what's going on between you two.
140,It ain't got nothing to do with me.
141,"How you doing, Lucas?"
142,I'm all right.
143,I need to ask for an extension on the final.
144,There's a lot of family stuff going on and uh...
145,I know going back to school hasn't been easy for you.
146,"But if you're going to turn this assignment in late, again, I'm going to need a note."
147,A note?
148,"Yeah, like a note from a doctor."
149,All right.
150,"Look, I want you to know something."
151,"That last assignment you turned in, was brilliant."
152,You think so?
153,"Yeah, it was the best in the class."
154,I'm not kidding.
155,Listen.
156,"You give me that note, I'll give you two days."
157,"It's not enough time, man."
158,I know it isn't.
159,But I believe you can do it.
160,Okay.
161,"Hey Lucas, wait up!"
162,What's this?
163,It's a contact at the student health services.
164,Maybe he can help you get that note.
165,"Cool, I'll get in touch."
166,Thanks.
167,"Take care, Lucas."
168,"You, too."
169,"The library is closing in five minutes, five minutes."
170,"Sir, the libraries closing."
171,"You just said five minutes, one minute ago."
172,Do you need help with anything?
173,"No, I don't need any help."
174,Just a little extra time.
175,Is that right?
176,"Mommy, is this way?"
177,Hmm hmm.
178,"Daddy, mommy's this way?"
179,Hmm hmm.
180,"Daddy, help us get PlayDoh."
181,"Daddy, help us get PlayDoh."

190,"Hurry dad, get some."
191,Look at the butterfly!
192,A butterfly.
193,"Dad, a butterfly."
194,Yeah.
195,It's like an orange.
196,It was orange and black.
197,Orange and black.

206,"I'll just lick it, that's okay."
207,Ah.

212," No, it's not close yet."
213,It just opened.
214, Open.
215, Yeah.
216, It's five minutes.
217, Yeah.
218,Mommy needs to get some?
219,"No, I don't think she wants any."
220,I think I'm gonna say yes.
221,You're going to say yes to her getting some?
222,"Okay, that's nice of you."
223,"Hi, bootie boo."
224,"How was your day, today?"
225," Um, good."
226, Good?
227,You wanna come to mommy?
228,What'd you have for lunch?
229,"Chocolate chip, chocolate chip ice cream?"
230,"Oh my gosh, you're such a lucky girl."
231,She was good for me today.
232,Yeah?
233,You wanna watch Goldie and the Bears?
234, Yeah.
235, While mommy and daddy talk?
236, In your room.
237," In your room, okay."
238,You're gonna watch Goldie and the Bear in your room.
239,"Lucas, I thought we agreed, no sugar?"
240,"Lazifa, I only gave her a little, it's not gonna kill her."
241,"Still, you're creating bad eating habits for her."
242,"So, how's school?"
243,It's all right.
244,You still talking to that girl?
245,What's her name?
246,"You mean, Mariah?"
247,Whatever.
248,"Nah, I haven't talked to her in a minute."
249,What's a minute?
250,"A little kiss, minute?"
251,"Happy birthday, ma."
252,"Ah, thank you, sweetie."
253,"Ah, you know, I don't like being reminded how old I am."
254,"Shoot, who does?"
255,Where's Zanura?
256,I thought she was coming with us.
257,She wanted to go to the circus with Lazifa.
258,"Lazifa texted me this morning, wishing me happy birthday."
259,I thought that was kind of sweet.
260,It was.
261,"You know, Lazifa should come by a little more often."
262,I can't remember when the last time I saw her.
263,"You know, it's one minute, we're up."
264,"One minute, we're down."
265,That doesn't have a damn thing to do with me.
266,"I really like her, a lot."
267,"Maybe, you should call her."
268,"I'm sure, she's around."
269,Why you always coming to the sales department?
270,You ain't gonna find nothing over here.
271,Just get what you want.
272,With what money?
273,"Hmm, take it."
274,I'm going to go check out these laptops.
275,"I'll be back, all right?"
276,"Don't leave me here too long, Lucas."
277,I won't.
278,How's the pizza?
279,It's all right.
280,Not really hungry anymore.
281,Did you get a chance to talk to Kenji?
282,"Yeah, I seen him."
283,Same old shit with that dude.
284,"He's your brother, Lucas."
285,"What's that supposed to mean, ma?"
286,Did you ever stop to think about how he feels?
287,"You know, what he's going through?"
288,"Ma, we've been here plenty of times."
289,I'm done helping that dude.
290,There's no such thing as helping anybody too much.
291,"You know, maybe that's the problem."
292,"Maybe we're helping 'em too much, you know?"
293,You ever think about that?
294,Are you insinuating that I'm an enabler?
295,"Ah, I didn't say all that."
296,"Yeah, you're insinuating that I'm an enabler."
297,"Thank you for the day, Lucas."
298,"No problem, ma."
299,I love you.
300,"Love you, too."
301,"Hmm, you want some broccoli?"
302, No.
303, You want the juice?
304, Yeah.
305, Okay.
306,"You should try to eat some of that broccoli, though."
307,There you go.
308,Here.
309,Here's your juice.
310,Is it good?
311,You should try some of the carrots.
312,What are you doing?
313,Writing.
314,Can I write?
315,You wanna write?
316,Yeah.
317,Okay.
318,"Here, you can write on this one."
319, This one?
320, Yeah.
321,That's a pretty picture.
322,"Hey, can you write your name?"
323,Yeah.
324,"Look at you, you're silly."
325,You forgot your shoes.
326,You're silly.
327,"Got it, look at that."
328,I see.
329,"Hello, you've received TC3's counseling and psychological services."
330,"My name is Ben, how can I help you?"
331,"Uh yeah, I'm a student at TC3."
332,I was wondering...
333,"Are you there, sir?"
334,"Uh, I'mma have to call you back."
335,Sir?
336,Hey.
337,What's up?
338,You grab everything?
339,"Yeah, how's Zanura?"
340,She's good.
341,She's napping right now.
342,Is she?
343,What you have for lunch?
344,She had broccoli and crackers.
345,"Okay, good."
346,She likes broccoli.
347,Is everything okay?
348,"Yeah, I'm good. Why?"
349,I just left your bags in the closet.
350,I thought you wanted to talk about?
351,I don't know.
352,"What do you mean, you don't know?"
353,I don't know.
354,"Yeah, I want you to take your things."
355,"As if I love you, like, what about Zanura, she needs me, too."
356,"Like, you need me."
357,"Like, if it's about Mariah, like, I'm not talking to her anymore, I promise."
358,I can't trust you.
359,"Look, I don't think you should sleep over anymore."
360,I need my own space.
361,"And if you need to see Zanura, you can come by tomorrow."
362,All right.
363,Okay.
364,Have you ever talked to anyone like me before?
365,"No, I can't say I have."
366,I'm kind of being forced to come here.
367,It's say here on your application that you're having problems studying.
368,"Yeah, it's kind kinda my thing."
369,"Hmm, so distractions at home or, elsewhere?"
370,"Yeah, home life."
371,"I mean, that's part of it."
372,It's my brother  Your brother's distracting you?
373,How old is your brother?
374,"He's 11 years older than me, still acting the same damn way we did as kids."
375,I know the type.
376,And what is it about your brother that's nagging you and preventing you from being productive?
377,Stealing from me.
378,"It's like, first it was my winter jacket."
379,"He took my daughter's piggy bank, sold that."
380,Now I'm without a computer.
381,I'm pretty sure it's him.
382,Is he stealing from the rest of your family?
383,"Just me, thinks I have a whole bunch of money or something."
384,Have you set boundaries with him?
385,Yeah.
386,It's like you tell him to do one thing and he does the complete opposite.
387,"And my mom, she doesn't choose sides, but, I think she knows I'm right."
388,"Lucas, what do you really want right now?"
389,I just don't want to go back to my old ways.
390,"Drinking, fucking, wanting to fight people for talking shit."
391,"Now, I just want my daughter to go to a good college."
392,"Shit, I even want Lazifa to be happy."
393,"I mean, she deserves that."
394,It's all good things to want.
395,You wanna talk a little bit more about that?
396,Is it going to get me a doctor's note?
397,"Because right now, I don't have too much time."
398,"I got to get going, soon."
399,"Lucas, do you think that you could tell your brother that you love him, but you know, you can't really hang if he's going to act out inappropriately?"
400,"To be honest with you, man, the next time I see that nigga, I'm going to kill him."
401,"Chapter five and chapter four are what you generally, ideas that you brought in the reflection page, I think."
402,"Which was it, chapter five and chapter 10?"
403, Chapter five and chapter 10.
404, Okay.
405,So it's like a reference to a similar issue that you were trying to address.
406,Which was it?
407,Class is over.
408,See you Mariah.
409,"And one thing that I would like to talk to you, is about your reflection that you send me."
410,"For me, it's not clear what you're trying to say..."
411,"So what is this, like some weird mating ritual you do?"
412,"Good evening to you, too."
413,"So you don't answer my texts, but you feel compelled to just pop up out of nowhere?"
414,"Fuck, are you going to get a drink?"
415,Since when do you drink?
416,I don't.
417,It's one of those days.
418,"Yeah well, apple juice doesn't count."
419,And don't rub it on your clothes.
420,"Just rub it on your hands, all right."
421,"You want some, Lazifa?"
422,Sure.
423,I want to smell good.
424,"We're all gonna smell good, oh, oh."
425," Yes, indeed."
426, Ew.
427,"How do you smell, how you smelling, you smelling good?"
428,"You gotta rub the backs, too, rub the backs."
429,"Yep, there you go."
430,Back of your hands.
431,"Gotta get in between your fingers, too."
432,"Gotta put on some perfume, here."
433,A little dab here.
434,A little dab there.
435,Some right down here.
436,"On your clothes, yeah, it's good."
437,"Smells good, let me smell."
438,Let me smell.
439,"Oh, you smell delicious."
440,Are you going to eat me?
441,"Well, not right, I think I'd rather eat this spaghetti."
442,How about that?
443,Are you gonna eat me?
444,"No, not without salt."
445,"Here, put some on."
446,"Let me see, turn around."
447,Let me see your face.
448,Turn around this way.
449,She's perking up her lips.
450,"Just a little bit, okay?"
451,"Do this, go."
452,"Yeah, I'm gonna rub that on just a little bit."
453,"Oh wow, wait a minute."
454,Not done yet.
455,"Turn around here, let me see."
456,"Zanura, aren't you too young for lipstick?"
457, No.
458," Say not today, mom."
459," Not today, mom."
460, How old are you today?
461, I'm three.
462, Three?
463,"Uh uh, here we go."
464,"See, you licking it off."
465,You're not suppose to lick it off.
466,"What do you want to drink, Darlene?"
467,I'll have a glass of ice water if you don't mind.
468,"Okay, got it."
469,"Okay, come here."
470,"Let me see, let me fix it."
471,"Let me look, turn around."
472,"Oh, you look beautiful."
473,"I like it, I like it, I like it."
474,Give me kisses.
475,Are you a good cook?
476,I'm a good cooker.
477,You're a good cooker?
478, Okay.
479, That's enough salt.
480,"So, how long have you been cooking?"
481,"Um, for 10 minutes."
482,This looks delicious.
483,Thank you.
484,I'm glad you invited me to dinner.
485,Zanura was looking forward to having this pasta with you.
486,"Mommy, thank you for the spaghetti."
487,"You are very welcome, Zanura."
488,Thanks for helping me.
489,You're welcome.
490,"Wipe your face, Zanura."
491,Good job.
492,"I know Lucas can be difficult sometimes, Lazifa."
493,"But I'd like it, if you two could work things out."
494,You play pool?
495,Do I hold a stick and try to hit balls on the table?
496,"Yeah, what you just said."
497,Can't say I do.
498,Mariah?
499,Yeah.
500,There's a lot you don't know about me.
501,There's a lot I don't tell you because I didn't want to scare you off.
502,"Everyone's got baggage, Luc."
503,It would be weird if you didn't.
504,I feel like you hide stuff from me because you think I don't understand or resent me for not having the same upbringing as you.
505,Are you kidding me?
506,"I'd trade places with you in the past, present and future."
507,Don't say that.
508,"Nah, it's real stuff."
509,What do you mean?
510,My father was murdered when I was six years old.
511,I never got to say goodbye to anybody.
512,"No friends, no family."
513,Do you miss him?
514,"Fuck, I hate talking about this shit."
515,"You know, when he died, it was just like I was expecting Kenji to fill his shoes."
516,"Well, I bet he'd be proud of you now."
517,Who knows?
518,I'm sorry.
519,It's hard.
520,Reminds me of all the stuff I had to learn my own.
521,Shit other kids took for granted.
522,"I can't keep doing this with you, Luc."
523,"Look, I'm sorry that happened."
524,I really am.
525,But you can't just say one thing and then expect everything between us to suddenly change.
526,"Like , why are we even trying to be something?"
527,I'm not normally around people like you.
528,"I mean, don't get me wrong."
529,I wanna be.
530,It's just...
531,What?
532,"It's just, what?"
533,Me and Lazifa split.
534,"I mean, everything I'm telling you is the truth."
535,You know?
536,"I'm not here to just hold your hand, when you're feeling down."
537,Where you going?
538,You need to figure your shit out.
539,Wait.
540,"You got this, right?"
541,So why is that one your mom and this one is me?
542," Because, I made it for me."
543, Okay.
544,I got one in my ear.
545,Okay.
546,"Um, look at what I have."
547,Hey.
548,Wanna come in?
549, Thanks.
550, Hmm hmm.
551," Hi, daddy."
552, What's up!
