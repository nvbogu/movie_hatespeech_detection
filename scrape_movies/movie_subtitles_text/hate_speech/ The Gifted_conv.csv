13, What's up with this glum face? You seem so sad.
14,This is supposed to be a happy time.
15,Why are you so glum?
16," Oh, no, I'm fine."

40,He's gotta be worried about her.
41,They have a lot going on.
42, So all of this mood has nothing to do with Allen?
43," chuckles No, I'm done with that."

45,"I'm sure you are too, right?"
46," Yeah, well, I am, but he's your brother."
47,And I know that you worry about him.
48,"I mean, it was tough enough getting him out of New York."
49,Now he's all the way stuck in Los Angeles.
50, Look at you. Stuck.
51,I'm pretty sure Allen don't see it that way.
52,You're funny.
53,gentle guitar music  No more glum face.

59," Too bad you won't sing, though."
60,You could lay down some of your songs.
61," Well, maybe find me a singer."
62, After Christmas for sure.

81, Not exactly a rousing endorsement for Los Angeles.
82,"You know, we miss you out here."
83," Oh, well, that's good to hear."
84,And I thought you'd be angry with me for not coming back.
85," Can't say I'm exactly happy about it, but you're a grown man, you make your own decisions."
86," Yeah, thanks for that."
87,"Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I'm considering coming back for Christmas."

97," Denise Yeah, it really is."
98, George It's cold though. You warm enough?
99, Denise Oh. Now I am.
100, That sure was nice of the neighbors to take the kids ice skating.
101, Do you remember the time Billy Thomas took a snowball and threw it right at my face?
102,And you chased him around the neighborhood.
103, I never did catch that kid.
104,"Last time he ever threw a snowball at you, though."
105, Yeah.
106,I knew that's when you loved me.
107, What are you talking about? We were just children.
108, Yeah. But I knew.
109," So on that note, why don't we call it a night?"
110,Go home early and get warm.
111, That sounds like a wonderful plan.
112, Yeah. Gives us some time together.
113,gentle guitar music Here you go.
114,Well done tonight.

119,I think he'd be really happy to see you.
120, I highly doubt that.
121,He won't even return my phone calls.
122, Well then don't do it for him.
123,Do it for you.
124,You're gonna continue to worry about him.
125," Yeah, you're probably right."
126,I'm gonna go by tomorrow and talk to him.
127, Good.
128,"You remember, Don tomorrow."
129," Yes, ma'am."
130,gentle guitar music  George. What are you doing here?
131," Don, fact is, I'm a little bit worried about you."
132,"And a whole lot of other people at church worried about you, too."
133," Well, that's nice."
134,You tell 'em I'm fine.
135," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Don!"
136,You're gonna need to do better than that.
137,"Let me in for a minute, all right?"
138,"Don, please."
139, All right.
140,Just sit there until you're convinced I'm doing fine.
141, All right. Then I will.
142,"Come on, Don. What's going on with you?"
143,A couple weeks ago in church you seemed to be just fine.
144, I haven't been too good for a while.
145,I guess I'm good at hiding it.
146, Sorry to hear that. I didn't know.
147, It's not your fault.
148,Things have been building up.
149,Mary Anne dying and Celia and I estranged.
150,"Then Thanksgiving came along, and I just got down in the dumps I guess."
151, I had no idea that you and Celia were estranged.
152, I guess that's what you call it.
153,She hasn't spoken to me in over a year.
154,She won't return any of my phone calls.
155, Huh.
156,Do you have any idea why?
157, We had a fight.
158,She said some things.
159,Well.
160,I said some things she didn't appreciate.
161, Maybe you need to patch things up.
162, I don't think so.
163,"Friend of mine called me from Cincinnati, said he saw her in a horror movie."
164,He's a horror buff.
165,Said he didn't think I'd be too proud.
166,I could never bring myself to watch it.
167," Yeah, yeah."
168,Can't say as I blame you for that.
169," So you see, things haven't been too good for a while."
170," But Don, see, these are the moments when you should be leaning on God."
171,"I mean, lean on the church, lean on us."
172," If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon set it out for a while."
173," Well, I can't force you. That's for sure."
174,But I can pray for you.
175," Put in a good word for Celia, too."
176," Yeah. I will, Don."
177,I'll pray for both of you.
178, Hey.
179," Hi, hi. Hey, hey, hey."
180," All right, how's Don?"
181," Yeah, that's not good."
182,The man's pretty low. Depressed.
183," Yeah, when I'm low, I normally go to church."
184,The fellowship lifts my spirit.
185," Yeah, me too. That's what I was telling him."
186,"I think if we could just get him in church for a little while, get him out of his own head, I think we can help him get through this."
187," Yeah, I mean, with Mary Anne being gone and Celia being so far away."
188, I can't imagine what the man's going through right now.
189,"And I know he misses Mary Anne, but I think it is, I think he's worried about Celia."
190,I think that's what's weighing on him right now.
191, Okay.
192, Carly stole my socks.
193, They're mine!
194, I got this.
195, Okay. Hey.
196, Huh?

205, George You remember Don Ford?
206," Yeah, sure."
207," Well, poor man, his wife passed away last year and he could really use some family support right about now."
208,"Celia, his only daughter, well, she's out there in Los Angeles, that's where you come in."
209, Okay. How?
210," Well, I mean, you've been considering making that trip back home."
211,I thought maybe you could reach out to Celia and see if she'd come back with you.
212,"You can make that crosscountry mission you keep talking about, and you'd both be home in time for Christmas."
213," Okay. Well, I'll do my best."
214,I was gonna tell you that I was gonna plan on coming home anyway for Christmas.
215,I can't make any promises that I can find Celia or even if she'd wanna come back.

304,My manager is very shrewd.

308, So what did you wanna talk about?

887,"Well, I did, and she's coming back."
888,She's gonna be here in time for Christmas.
889,So I go over to give them the good news.

891," Well, maybe it's his mess and he wanted to take care of it himself."
892,Huh? Ever consider that?
893,"George chuckles  Okay. Yeah, maybe."

898, Right.
899, Right?

904,"I mean, that's completely irrational."
905," Yeah, well."
906, Really.
907,You don't think she's gonna show up here and he's gonna turn her away at the door.
908," Well, I don't know him."
909,I don't know what they're like.
910,But I know like if it were Denise...
911,"sighs I never told you this, but when she was teenager, we had a big fight."
912,And she wouldn't speak to me for weeks.
913,"And I was just, at first I was angry."
914,"And then I wanted to forgive her and have her forgive me, but she just wouldn't talk to me."
915,And then one day I came home from work and she's sitting on the porch.
916,"And she comes down to the car and she puts her arms around my neck, just not a word, just hugs me."
917,One of the best days of my life.
918,"So, I don't know."
919,"It'll probably be a bumpy ride when they get here, but just have to pray that their love will see them through that."
920,Hmm?
921," Yes, sir."
922,Thank you.
923,I'll be praying for him.
924, Bob Yeah. You do that.
925,Bob chuckles gentle guitar music  There must be an electrician who can come over and fix this.
926, I've called everyone. It's just too close to Christmas.
927," Believers, nonbelievers, everyone takes this week off."
928, It's like a light show in there.
929,"It's brighter on one side, dimmer on the other."
930,And then they all just go out.
931, Is that dangerous?
932," No, honey. Well, I don't think so."
933, Wait a second. My brother.
934,He knows sort of an electrician. His name is Merle.
935, Sort of an electrician?
936,Isn't that like sort of being a NASCAR driver?
937," Yeah, Veronica, how sort of is he?"
938," Well, he wired his farmhouse out in Nicholasville."
939,I'm not sure how that turned out.
940, But is he licensed?
941, I think so.
942,"I mean, wouldn't he have to be?"

951,I have a confession to make.
952, What do you mean?
953," Well, since you told me about some difficult things about yourself, I thought I'd be honest with you."
954,I had promised to make this trip months ago.
955,I just didn't want to.
956,I wanted to stay in L.A. and play my music.
957, Why didn't you then?
958, I convinced myself that I could do that and serve the Lord.
959,"You know, write Christian songs and play my music."
960, That still sounds like a really good life.
961," Yeah, I guess so."
962,Then every Sunday I started just coming up with excuses not to go.
963,My songs became less about the Lord.
964,"Then my pastor called me and asked me to be part of the music program, and I came up with some lame excuse not to do it."
965, Is that when you realized you weren't serving the Lord?
966, My brother called me.
967,He wanted me to come home.
968,And then he told me about you and your dad.
969, But I said no. laughs  I know you did.

1183,He's just concerned about you.
1184," It's not the questions, Allen."
1185,It's how he asked them.
1186,Are you taking his side?
