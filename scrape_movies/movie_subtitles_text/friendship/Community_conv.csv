551," She concentrates better in the dark, a lot better."
552," This is my first like, professional job."
553, What's all this hoopla about  Angelica shut up.

581,"That is great, you are done."
582,"You don't need any more practice, relax."
583, I used to do Shakespeare in the park.
584,This is what I have to show for it.
585," The rehearsals are always chaotic, with all that nervous, excited energy, I mean, people are just pumped for Showtime."
586," It was the best of times, and the worst of times, then the worst of times, would be the best."
587,I'll work on it.
588," No, no accent."
589," I'll be great, I'll be fine."
590,It's December the 24th and the town is just waking up.
591," Hey guys, that was really good."
592,"I wanna take you through at least one more time, okay?"
593,"So every first positions, good."

600, Mom  Nick is working very hard.
601," Yes, yes, we're on Facebook and Instagram."
602, What do you want me to do?
603,Go pull all the homeless meth heads off the street.
604, I've stooped lower.
605, We are  fucked.
606, Everyone has been so amazing to work with.
607," Just a tip, the thing about guys  Yeah ,I'm not taking advice from a dude, who lost the encouragement to a girl."
608, We were the perfect size for the course.
609, Thank you.
610,"Sometimes just go hit them with your big black   Well, I don't like being lied to."
611,But maybe we should keep looking for work together.
612,"Just, as friends."
613," Hunter, that was wonderful, but maybe don't give it a hundred percent quite yet, like save some for the performance."
614, I wasn't.
615," Hunter is a good actor, I won't deny that."
616,"But there's a difference between being a good actor, being a good person, and his singing is, I'm not jealous."
617,"Hunter is good at what he does, but I think anyone would be good, if they were afforded the same time and privilege."
618,"Some of us have to bake our cake, before we're allowed to eat it."
619,âª You get what you deserve âª Any notes?
620," No, not at all."
621," I think if you actually emphasize morning, and then let your voice break a little bit in the second verse, it would add a lot of power to your performance."
622," That's a great note, Chloe."
623,"Yeah I'll do that, thanks."
624, Why did I say that?
625," Guys look, I know it's been a rough start, but are going to kill this."
626,"It's not even a huge train wreck, and you know what?"
627,"You were amazing and you've worked so hard, and you deserve this."
628, What are we getting?
629, What?
630," You, said you deserve this."
631,"So I thought, I don't know, I thought we were getting presents or something."
632," Hey, cuddle, everyone come in."
633, Can I just say a quick word?
634,"Like guys we're about to do something amazing, and we have rehearsed and prepared and we're ready."
635,"Look, I know some of this might be new for some of you, and you know, some of you might still be nervous, but look just know this."
636,"I have never been more proud to work, and to strive alongside this group of thespians."
637,We are going to spread that Christmas spirit.
638,"We are going to stir the primordial emotions, that live in the hearts of every one, of those audience members."
639,"We are going to create,  Yes, you got this."
640, I'm truly proud of you guys too.
641, Cool.
642," All right, wow."
643, I'm gonna throw up.
644," Am gonna do that, what is it."
645," I'm very nervous ,I mean, was Napoleon nervous about Waterloo?"
646,Was Nixon worried about Watergate?
647,Of course I'm nervous.
648,"But the bottom line is, I believe in my team."
649,And no good manager who cares about the craft isn't nervous.
650,"It's because we care, it's because we love, and that love, is gonna manifest itself, into the magic of the theater."
651," Hey, good luck, take your nails off."
652,"Hey, good luck."
653,You got this.
654, Is anyone gonna frigging show up?
655," Trust the process Karen, it gonna be fine."
656,And that's the power of manifestation.
657," No, but seriously where are all these people coming from?"
658," Mama has fast hands, this ain't my first rodeo."
659," Lacey we've sailed so many seas together, and I've planted many seeds."
660,"No, if I'm a tree, maybe you could be my stone."
661,No standing in front of a girl.
662,"Yeah, yeah, that's a good, that's better, that's better, Lacey you drive me crazy  I hate this place."
663," I'm so afraid, I'm gonna look like an idiot, doing something I'm just totally not prepared for."
664,"Argh, Nana's ring!"
665, What's that?
666," Weed mint, you want one?"
667, Why would I want that?
668,I am a professional.
669,"I don't need to be high to be talented, Olivia."
670, Just thought you might want a little 'calm me' down.
671,I don't need to calm down Olivia.
672," Okay seriously Karen, you need to relax  Don't, don't touch me, I am going to be fine."
673,I am calm.
674, Mhmm.
675," What, what are you all looking at?"
676,Did you all talk about this?
677,Is this is this what everyone thinks?
678,"Oh, let's just give Karen a little weed."
679,Maybe it'll make our lives a little easier.
680,You think this is hard?
681,You think I'm hard?
682,"This is child's play, and you amateurs have a lot to learn."
683,If you think this is a real theater.
684,"If you have only known what I have seen, in this world and survived as a human, and as a mother."
685,You'd be crawling at my feet right now.
686,"I know you all think, I am some grachety bitch, who shouldn't be a mother."
687,"But let me just tell you one thing, I am a good mother  Mama  Shut up!"
688, Can I have a mint?
689, Yeah.
690, I want two.
691, Have as many as you want girl.
692, I'm taking three.
693, You know frustrations is  Shut up Hunter.
694, We like to call it the preshow Karen explosion.
695," Okay, everyone, we've made it this far."
696,"Let's just please make it to the show, okay?"
697,"Hunter, fix your bender."
698,"Karen, get it together."
699,"Everyone, Let's get mind up."
700,"Amy, stop farting."
701," Okay, We can do this."
702," Hey, break a branch, okay?"
703," Welcome everyone, thank you so much for coming out, to our show tonight."
704,"We hope you enjoy the very hard work, our young thespians have put into this play, and without further ado, the little stage theater proudly presents, Christmas, what does it mean?"
705," To an outsider, mall town Kansas might not seem to like, the place to find the true Christmas spirit."
706,"You'd be more likely fun an abundant of sorghum crop, or a batch of Bessie's famous pepper nut cookies."
707,"But the truth is, Christmas is alive and well here."
708,And it is in abundance.
709,"This is the story, about a town square Christmas tree."
710,A story about good regular Christian folk.
711,A story about a small town.
712,"âª Born like any other tree, but given time to go âª âª I was touched by Jesus Christ, and that began to show âª âª I got the Christmas spirit inside of me âª âª From root to stem and stem to leaf âª âª Today I'm called the small town Christmas tree âª âª But I don't belong to them and they don't belong to me âª âª You see, I was here long long ago âª âª Before settlers changed from towns and roads âª âª Let me kick y'all back to a time before âª âª when I was greeted by angels from the Lord âª âª Don't mean no tents or lie to you âª âª When Christ was born, I was part of that shit âª That was right."
713,"âª You've been chosen among your kid âª âª Especially for you to mark a world saved from sin âª âª Now Christ is gone, mother Mary's given birth âª âª From around the earth âª âª Christmas tree âª  Wow, a Christmas tree."
714,"âª I can promise you too âª âª Here and now ill share God's love whenever I'm firm âª âª A town will be build around the root âª âª I'll be here always showing the prove âª âª The people will come settlers arrived âª âª Oh God's love giving up his only son âª âª Celebrate, it's Christmas, Christmas âª âª I'm a Christmas tree âª âª I'm here for Kansas âª  And thus the young sapling, was made into this small town Christmas tree."
715,"Now this town, it went through its own trials, and tribulations, its own histories."
716,"Fields were sown, town square was built, houses resurrected, silos and barns popped up like Kansas milkweed, but that's a story for another time."
717,"Right now, we're gonna move forward to, a darker time in its history."
718,We're going to move forward to the dust bowl years.
719,It's the height of the great depression.
720,"And even then, somehow spirits are still high."
721,"It's the 24th of December, the town is just waking up."
722," Not gonna lie, it lifted my spirits event."
723,It's good to know karma still works.
724," Bless his heart that had to have hurt, really."
725,Is he alright?
726,"âª The sun is slowly rising âª âª And all the fields are green âª âª Cover each and every plain âª âª The general store is open with  see âª âª The chefs are cooking âª âª And the keepers keeping bees âª âª Buzz buzz âª âª The ranch hand scrums, the cattle loud âª âªTo lots of feed âª âª The teachers and her students âª âª got a lot to write and read âª âª The preacher write his sermons get ready for his church âª âª The dairies melanoma mongers âª âª she's mama bird is on patch âª âª Chip chip âª âª And we both regret his rising and every of his fan âª âª Father wakes for morning prayers âª âª We've fought for every man âª âª The times are tough on his resource âª âª We're counting every dime âª âª It be a normal Kansas morning âª âª but now its Christmas time âª âª It'd be a normal Kansas but now it's Christmas time âª  What?"
727," Should have heard it, in here."
728,It was a lot louder.
729," I was really nervous about that big opening dance number, my whole four seconds of it."
730," Please, alms please, alms for the poor, or ma'am don't you have any coins, for a poor old woman?"
731," Ma'am we don't have any money, Ma'am we don't have any money, Ma'am we don't have any money."
732,  say.
733," I can't offer you any money ma'am, but we can offer you some breakfast."
734," I would love that, to warm my poor old, cold old bones."
735," I like to prepare by really centering myself, in the character 'cause everybody has something in them, that we can relate to, you know?"
736,So like my character is poor.
737, What's all this hoopla about Christmas?
738,"I mean What are these foolish people, have to celebrate anyway?"
739,Why I can't they let me rest?
740," Turmeric, egg whites, lemon, apple cider vinegar, and a little dash of honey."
741,"Not a lot, start my day with that."
742,And then I just let greatness ensue.
743," Interviewer Whoa, wow, Okay, but as an actor?"
744, I learned it from my dad.
745, Interviewer Okay.
746, My dad died in a fire.
747," Good morning, sir."
748,I'm glad to see you're awake.
749,The rest of your kin are in the soup line for breakfast.
750," Soup, for breakfast?"
751, It's all we've got.
752," Soup for breakfast, nothing for lunch, soup for dinner."
753," Please try to make the best of it, sir."
754,Where's your Christmas spirit?
755, Christmas spirit?
756,What a lack.
757,"If Jesus wants to save me, he can start by finding me a job."
758, Jesus does want to save you.
759," Yeah, Yeah, I heard all about that, every day as a youngling, and I'd never shantytown from here to Hooverville, and Georgia, it's a bunch of a lucky."
760," It is not, but I'm sure you'll find that out in time."
761,"If it's a job you want, I may be able to help you today."
762, How's that?
763," Well, fact is there's talk in town, that the tractor factory, is opening back up over in factory town."
764, Is that right?
765, That's a fact.
766,And I know where it is.
767, Why are you so we get to help me?
768,Why do you want to get out of here so bad?
769," As a volunteer, and a good Christian woman, it's my job to help the less fortunate."
770,"So let's get some soup in your belly, and get on the road."
771, It picks up in the second half.
772, Boy it sure is a brisk winter's day.
773,"It's a good thing there isn't too much snow, it's gonna make traveling easier."
774," Traveling's never easy, train, horse, a foot, it ain't never easy."
775, Why can't you ever see the bright side of things?
776,Were you a drinker?
777," Yes, and I drank, but I never got ill tempered."
778, Did you gamble?
779," Yep I did my share of gambling, but I never cheated no one."
780, Oh the Lord doesn't wanna hear your excuses.
781,"And it sounds like your sister in law, didn't either."
782," Anyway, I can't afford to drink or gamble now, Only thing I've got from those days, is my brother's Bowie knife."
783,"Yep, argh ,argh ."
784," Oh, it's a lovely blade."
785," We almost had a props crisis, but fortunately Angelica pulled through, and had a switch blade on her, I mean, what are the odds?"
786, I like to be prepared.
787," Yup, it's good for skinning a buck, shaving, fishing, or just regular plain eating."
788,"At least it was, back when I had some meat at supper time."
789,Ain't much use on soup.
790, It reminds me of my father's knife.
791," Oh, my God."
792, Did you .
793," Yes, I called the power company twice, I ."
794," So, how did you find yourself at the church?"
795, Keith.
796,Why aren't you married off?
797," Oh,  Give me the snow."
798, Okay.
799, I had a man once.
800, So what happened?
801," Just throw it, come on."
802, Are you sure  That's a story for another day.
803, Oh.
804," That's fine, I didn't mean to cry."
805," Oh boy, it's really starting to come down."
806," Ain't nothing for it, just kind of keep walking."
807," Oh, Antonio we're not, we're not dressed for a blizzard."
808,We can't keep going on like this.
809," We can't go back, it's too far."
810,"Maybe there's a farm, if we just keep moving forward."
811," Woo, oh my feet hurt, it's so cold."
812, I may have something for them.
813,"Will not much, but maybe this'll help."
814,"I mean, I'm sorry I'm not prepared it's just, we don't have leather like this down in Georgia."
815, It's so cold.
816, But what can we do but keep walking?
817, We can pray.
818," Well, as long as you can pray, and keep moving, I'm all for it."
819," Dear Lord, We are two humble travelers, making our way to a better life, and to continue spreading your word, please on this Holy Yule tide send us help, so that we may spread Christ's love."
820,"If we are to die today, we understand that it is in your will."
821,"If it is not, please send us a sign, or a savior."
822," Well, that is a beautiful moment, I will never see again."
823," Well, that didn't work."
824,"  Hark, do you hear that?"
825," I can't hear nothing over this confounded, wind and the sound of chattering teeth."
826," No, hold on stop walking."
827," No, we can't stop walking."
828,We just gotta keep moving.
829," Oh gosh, backstage is such a rush, you know?"

943," Well, did you try to get a divorce?"
944," Well, our town's pastor was his drinking, and gambling buddy."
945,"Once he turned to drink, he used most of our savings for it."
946,I had to savage what little I could.
947," Oh, you stole that?"
948," Well, I suppose I stole half of it."
949,The other half was already mine.
