19,The path favored by Mayor Kobayashi is cruel and unscientific.

98,"Uh, how could you? You're a..."
99,"Go ahead, say it."
100,"I'm a stray, yeah."
101,How does she keep her fur so clean?
102,There's no shampoo on Trash Island.
103,"You heard the rumor, right?"
104,About her and Felix.
105,What'd they say?
106,Felix? No.
107,What happened to them?
108,They mated.
109,Ooh.
110,Who is Felix again?
111,All the ones I like: they're never in heat.
112,"Hey, now, that puddlejumper's flying crooked."
113," Oh, you're right."
114, Ease up.
115,Pull up.
116,He's gonna lose a wing.
117,Wow.
118,"Part One: The Little Pilot."" Small guy."
119,Not much meat on him.
120,"Yeah, is he dead?"
121,He looks dead.
122,I have a question.
123,"Are we eating him, or is this a rescue?"
124,We don't know yet.
125,Nobody's eating the little pilot.
126,Not even the dead body of him.
127,Dogs don't eat masters.
128,You're not our leader.
129,We all are. Let's take a vote.
130,"All in favor of not eating the little pilot, say ""Aye""."
131, Aye.
132, Nay.
133,"Firstthingsfirst: let's open his helmet so he can breathe some air if he's alive, then see if we can pull that hunk of broken propellerclutch out of the side of his head if it doesn't kill him."
134, Does that sound right?
135," Yeah, that's right."
136,Mmmhmm.
137,Spotsu! Spotsu! Spotsu!
138,We get the idea.
139,"You're looking for your lost dog, Spots."

141, Hmm. No.
142,Uhuh.
143,Wow.
144,"In response to questions regarding the purported disappearance of his ward Atari, Mayor Kobayashi offers no comment and urges reporters to respect the privacy of the mayoralhousehold."
145,"Atari, aged 12, was last seen early yesterday morning rolling a small airplane onto a runway at Megasaki Executive Airport."
146,24 hours later.
147,I bite.
148,I beg your pardon.
149,Ignore that dog.
150,He's got Snoutfever.
151,Just please follow us.
152,"Now, I never met him, but I asked around."
153,I understand he made a lot of friends.
154,"He had a very goodnatured temperament, I'm told."
155,"Of course, you would know best."
156,It's just a bit further up here on the left.
157,"Anyway, as I say, he seemed to have been an extremely pleasant animal."
158,"Unfortunately, nobody could figure out how to open his dogcage."
159,Three years earlier.
160,"The sole survivor of last week's colossal bullettrain disaster, a young boy named Atari, awoke from a deepcoma early this morning to learn of his parents' tragic deaths and also the intention of his distantuncle, Mayor Kobayashi, to personally adopt him as ward to the mayoralhousehold."
161,"Upon his release from Megasaki General, Atari who suffered the loss of his right kidney and numerous broken bones in the crash will live in sequestered quarters within the confines of Brick Mansion, where he will be educated in solitude by private tutors."
162,Atari has also been assigned a securitydetail for his own protection in the form of a highly trained bodyguarddog named Spots Kobayashi.
163,"Um, you're my new master."
164,My name is Spots.
165,I'm at your service.
166,I'll be protecting your welfare and safety on an ongoingbasis.
167,In other words: I'm your dog.
168,Bodyguarddog! Not pet!
169,"I can hear you, Master Atari."
170,I can hear you.
171,I can hear you.
172,I can hear you.
173,"Oh, no."
174,You need a key.
175,Where'd you get that?
176,What? I always had this.
177,I stole it off the dead skeleton.
178,"Oh, no."
179,Hey! The wrong dog died!
180,The wrong dog died!
181,The wrong...
182,The wrong dog died.
183,He's not Spots.
184,Who is that?
185,I can't smell him.
186,This is child abuse.
187,"Chief, you fight the robotdog."
188,Wait. What?
189,"King, Duke, Boss? You attack the three dogcatchers."
190,On it.
191,I'll guard the little pilot.
192,On my command. Ready?
193,Wait a second!
194,I am not gonna fight this robot!
195,"I'm against the little pilot, remember?"
196,I don't even believe in masters.
197,You're the best in a scrap.
198,We all know that.
199,You like to fight.
200,"Well, let's take a vote."
201,"All in favor of Chief fighting the robotdog, say ""Aye""."
202, Aye.
203, Nay.
204,Sic 'em.
205,"My ward, Atari, has been kidnapped against his will by a pack of disobedient, contagious, infected animals."
206,"He will be rescued promptly, returned to safety, and grounded for the duration of his childhood years."
207,"His five dogabductors have been identified through the use of advanced ToothandTail Recognition Software: They will, of course, be captured and violently destroyed."
208,"Chief ought to get a checkup, too."
209,He looks worse than anybody.
210,I wish somebody spoke his language.
211,Sito!
212,"Well, I understood that."
213,Sit down.
214,Sito!
215,Chief! Sit!
216,I don't sit.
217,You're disobedient! Sit!
218,No.
219,"I wouldn't drink that, if I were you."
220,It's full of toxic chemicals.
221,How do you know?
222,"Because my sisterinlaw drank it, and her tongue turned black."
223,Oh.
224,You're Felix's mate.
225,I beg your pardon?
226,"I mean, I think you mated with Felix, if I heard it right?"
227,That's none of your business.
228,"No, no, I don't suggest whether it actually happened or not."
229,I'm just saying that I recognize you from when I heard that rumor.
230,I think I'm going to say goodnight.
231,"Wait, wait, wait. No."
232,Wait. Start over.
233,Who cares about Felix?
234,I'm Chief.
235,That's my name.
236,I see.
237,I'm introducing myself.
238,Who are you?
239,I thought you knew all about me.
240,"No, I don't know anything."
241,I should've kept my mouth shut.
242,It's all hearsay.
243,"Anyway, you're Nutmeg."
244,"So you do know me, after all."
245,After all? Yes.
246,"You a showdog, Nutmeg?"
247,I was bred as a showdog.
248,I was groomed for that purpose.
249,It wasn't my choice.
250,I don't consider it my identity.
251,"Anyway, look around."
252,What difference does it make now?
253,So that's a yes.
254,"So that's a: yes, I used to be."
255,May I join you?
256,You've been attacked.
257,Hmm. What else is new?
258,You should see the other dog.
259,"Actually, I think he was made of stainlesssteel."
260,I couldn't get my teeth into him.
261,Who is the little pilot?
262,What'd he do?
263,Why are they after him?
264,Nobody knows.
265,"You're a stray, aren't you?"
266,"Yes, I'm a stray."
267,But aren't we all?
268,"In the last analysis, I mean?"
269,Were you trained?
270,For competition.
271,I was a showdog.
272,"You know a few tricks, then."
273,A few.
274,Can I see one?
275,Maybe if I get to know you better.
276,Fair enough.
277,"It's not true, by the way."
278,About me and Felix.
279,For the record.
280,I wouldn't bring puppies into this world.
281,I don't believe in masters.
282,I never did.
283,It's against my principles.
284,But this is no place for a dog like you.
285,You belong somewhere.
286,You've got papers.
287,"Oh, I'm fullgrown, sweetheart."
288,You don't have to worry about me.
289,Goodnight.
290,I hope I'll see you again.
291, Here's one.
292, One what?
293,"I'm supposed to be spinning a ninepound bowlingball over my head at this point, but you just have to imagine that part."
294,Oh.
295,I can picture it.
296,Will you help him?
297,The little pilot?
298,Why should I?
299,Because he's a 12yearold boy.
300,Dogs love those.
301,"Spots, whoever he is, might be alive, and he might be dead, but one thing's for sure: he's nowhere around here."
302,He's not in the dogcommunity.
303,There's probably another of unmapped wasteland on Trash Island at least.
304,Where do we start?
305,"Also, the mental health question: maybe it's because of that propellerclutch stuck in the side of his head I can't say, I'm not a doctor, but I think the little pilot's got a screw loose."
306,Those are the cons.
307,"You heard the rumor, right?"
308,About the little pilot.
309,Which rumor?
310,What is that?
311,Kobayashi is his distant uncle.
312,He's the mayor's ward.
313, What?
314, Whoa.
315,"Be that as it may, let's look at the pros."
316,"That boy flew here, all alone, and crashlanded onto this island for one reason; one reason only: to find his dog."
317,"To the best of my knowledge, no other master, not one single human master, has made any effort to do that."
318,They've forgotten all about us.
319,"I propose we start tomorrow, firstlight."
320,We'll cross the Middle Fingers.
321,We'll find the tugboat on the Dune.
322,We'll go see Jupiter and Oracle.
323,They'll know what to do.
324,Let's take a vote.
325,"All in favor say ""Aye""."
326, Aye.
327, Nay.
328,Who's the naysayer?
329, Him.
330, Me.
331,That kid is gonna get us all put to sleep. Euthanized.
332,"We won't find the dog, but we will die trying."
333,Not a bad way to go.
334,"You're outvoted, anyway."
335,ScienceParty Candidate Professor Watanabe has been placed under housearrest today at Toho Mountain Ryokan after offering sharp criticism last night of the Kobayashi Administration's Canine Saturationcrisis policy: Foreignexchange student Walker.
336,"Thank you, EditorHiroshi."
337,You all know me.
338,"I speak my mind, and sometimes that ruffles some feathers."
339,"Please, forgive my bluntness."
340,"Mayor Kobayashi is a crook, and I hate him."
341,"Right now, he faces a divided congress during a hotlycontested reelection year."
342,Dogs are dying on a miserable island.
343,Gullible masters have been brainwashed.
344,The ScienceParty Candidate is being held against his will with no recourse to legal counsel.
345,Somebody is up to something.
346,You have a conspiracy theory?
347,I have a hunch.
348,I don't print hunch.
349,Huh?
350,I'll spell it out.
351,"I believe Municipal Dome propaganda has deliberately stoked irrational, AntiDog fear and suppressed a medically proven DogFlu treatment in order to promote a secret campaign to turn the country against its innocent housepets."
352,There. I said it.
353,Can you prove it?
354,I don't know.
355,To tell you the truth: I don't know.
356,"âª I've lost all of my pride âª âª I've been to paradise and out the other side âª Part Two: ""The Search for Spots."" âª With no one to guide me âª âª Torn apart by a fiery wheel inside me âª âª An untouched diamond âª âª That's golden and brilliant without illumination âª âª Your mouth's a constellation âª âª The stars are in your eyes âª âª I'll take a spaceship and try and go and find you âª The Middle Fingers of Trash Island wind and weave upriver, interstitched by zigzagging pipelines and rusty viaducts."
357,The ruins of a failed utilitycomplex washedout by tsunami.
358,The rubble of an abandoned powerplant demolished by earthquake.
359,The remains of a deserted industrial estate destroyed by volcanic blast.
360,"âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª The Old Trash Island Athletic Club, memberless and longforgotten."
361,"Okay, I got a question."
362,What's your favorite food?
363,A doubleportion of DoggyChop from the can mixed into a bowl of broken PuppySnaps with a vitamin crushed up into it.
364,King's the spokesdog for that.
365,He's the DoggyChop dog.
366,Mmm. Used to be.
367,Was that your daily meal?
368,Not always. My master was a schoolteacher.
369,"We weren't rich, you know. You?"
370,"A centercut Kobe ribeye, seared, on the bone, with salt and pepper."
371,Wow.
372,It was my birthday supper. Every year.
373,"Mine's hotsausage, yakitoristyle."
374,The snack vendor always saved me one on gamedays.
375, Hmm. Duke?
376," Ah, greentea ice cream."
377,My master had a sweettooth.
378,I probably inherited it from her.
379,"You heard the rumor, right?"
380,About DoggyChop.
381,Remind us again.
382,What rumor?
383,"Oh, they folded."
384,"Oh, no."
385,Doggy... DoggyChop folded?
386,"How about you, Chief?"
387,What was your favorite food?
388,"Me? Oh, I don't care."
389,"Garbage, trash, scraps of rubbish."
390, I'm used to leftovers.
391, Hmm.
392,"Yeah, yeah."
393,"Of course, I wasn't always a stray."
394,Wait. What'd you say?
395,I said I wasn't always a stray.
396, Really? Since when?
397, Tell us about that.
398,I've been hunted by dogcatchers all my life.
399,I'm not easy to trap.
400,"I've only got three captures on my record where I actually got sent to the pound, I mean, and the first two times, I escaped within 24 hours, but the third time..."
401,I got adopted before I could finish digging the breakouttunnel.
402,It was a big family.
403,Five kids.
404,"Two other dogs, already."
405,They stuck me in the back of a stationwagon and drove me out to the middle of the sticks.
406,"Grass, trees, swimming pool."
407,Cartoons on TV.
408,"Anyway, one morning a week later, the youngest boy, his name was Toshiro, woke me up at 6:15, brighteyed, wideawake, and he tried to pet me."
409,He didn't mean anything by it.
410,He was just being friendly.
411,"Apparently, I bit him so hard, I nearly chewed his hand off."
412,Blood all over the kitchen floor.
413,They rushed him to the emergency room and I got padlocked out in the toolshed with the lights out.
414,It gave me some time to think.
415,What happened?
416,Why did I do that?
417,"To this day, I have no idea."
418,I guess he scared me.
419,I bite.
420,"That night, an old woman, she must've been the grandmother brought me out a bowl of some homemade hibachichili."
421,"I like to think she cooked it for me, personally but who knows?"
422,Maybe it was just more leftovers. But...
423,You've got a tick.
424,"Anyway, that's my favorite food I ever ate."
425,The old woman made a great bowl of chili.
426,What happened after that?
427,"I dug my way out by morning, jumped on the back of a dumptruck, and hitched back to Megasaki."
428,"I was always a streetdog, let's face it."
429,Somebody's stalking us.
430,"As you know, we all hate dogs."
431,"Chairman Fujimotosan, President of Kobayashi Pharmaceutical."
432,"You secretly introduced megaquantities of infected fleas and contagious ticklarvae into a metropolitan city center, creating an unprecedented animaldisease outbreak."
433,Thank you.
434,"General Yamatachisan, Commander of the Megasaki Municipal Task force."
435,"You oversaw the deportation of over 750,000 cagedanimals to a nearly uninhabitable offshore refusecenter."
436,Good work.
437,"Supervisor Kitanosan, Director of Kobayashi Robotics."
438,"You developed the most promising artificial lifeform in the history of corporatetechnology and a powerful new weapon, to boot."
439,Well done.
440,"Yakuza Nakamurasan, Head of the ClenchedFist Gang."
441,"You eliminated all ProDog opposition through the use of bribery, extortion, intimidation, and violent force."
442,My compliments.
443,Brains have been washed.
444,Wheels have been greased.
445,Fear has been mongered.
446,Now we prepare for the final stage of our conspiracytheory: the permanent end to the Canine Saturationcrisis.
447,We believe we've recovered a viable DNA sample from this article of damaged aviation equipment.
448,We're going to check it right now if you care to observe.
449,We call upon doglovers everywhere to harken to this transmission: Mayday! Mayday!
450,Unscheduled Junior TurboProp in severe distress over Sapporo River.
451,"Enginefailure, and detachment of left wing."
452,Will attempt emergencylanding on Trash Island coast.
453,"Please, make note of the following: to my securitydetail / bodyguarddog, Spots Kobayashi, if still living, I leave all my worldly possessions."
454,"If Spots has preceded me into the next life, I ask that everything, including my own bones and Spots' carcass, be burned in a crematory furnace, with our ashes scattered to the fourwinds."
455,It will not amount to much pollution in this sad land.
456,"If I survive, ignore this message."
457,I've gone to find my dog.
458,Young masters of Megasaki: unite!
459,Turpentine brandy.
460,It cools the head and warms the dogbones.
461,It may snow tonight.
462,Really? Thank you very much. Wow.
463,To whom it may concern.
464, She sees the future.
465, No.
466,She understands T.V.
467,You seek a dog named Spots.
468, DogZero.
469, DogZero.
470,"As you know, most of the animals on this island come from human homes with domesticated backgrounds."
471,"However, a small population of savage, aboriginal dogs have been scavenging the Metropolitan DumpingGrounds for nearly a decade."
472,The graffiti on this wall depicts the story.
473,They were born into captivity on the ends of the fringes of the most distant reaches of the island.
474,They endured great suffering and cruelty at the hands of their former masters.
475,"Finally, in the wake of an Act of God, they escaped to a harsh and desperate freedom."
476,"Some say they died away over the subsequent years, starving and forgotten."
477,"Some say they swam to the mainland, but this seems unlikely."
478,Too far to dogpaddle.
479,"Some say they're still with us, in the Faraway Cuticles, beyond the Middle Fingers."
480,We know the animal you seek.
481,He has appeared in Oracle's visions.
482,"A prophecy suggests itself: Spots, if he's alive, may very well be living, even at this moment, as a captive prisoner abducted into the company of these wild, savage dogs."
483,"Oracle, what do you think?"
484,What?
485,Continue your journey.
486,Have faith in your cause.
487,Luck and good fortune be unto you.
488,"You heard the rumor, right?"
489,About these aboriginal dogs.
490, Remind me again.
491, What's the rumor?
492,"Uh, they're cannibals."
493,So you're telling me they're going to want to eat us?
494,"Well, they're cannibals."
495,We're approaching the end of Old Trash Island.
496,To the west: the Sapporo River and Megasaki City.
497,To the east: the opensea.
498,"To the north: a long, rickety causeway over a noxious sludgemarsh leading to a radioactive landfill polluted by toxic chemicalgarbage."
499, That's our destination.
500, Great.
501,Got it.
502,Get ready to jump.
503,"Atari, I'm going to drag you overboard with my teeth, since you can't understand the plan."
504,"After that, we're back on foot."
505,The next stage...
506,Where'd they...
507,Where'd they go?
508,What are they doing over there?
509,How did this happen?
510,What's going on with this contraption?
511,"If we get separated, which we are: rendezvous at the causeway!"
512,You're not our leader!
513,What?
514,You're not our leader!
515,We all are!
516,Let's take a vote!
517,"All in favor of my plan, which is to rendezvous at the causeway..."
518,Let's go.
519,"No, you can't ride the PagodaSlide."
520,"You're below the safetylimit, anyway. Let's go."
521,"We made an emergency plan, even if we didn't get to vote and agree to it yet: rendezvous at the causeway to the Faraway Cuticles, and go find your dog."
522,"Maybe everybody else just got crushed, compacted, and incinerated but we're going to be there."
523,Let's go.
524,Don't.
525,Repeat: don't.
526,I am not your pet.
527,I never liked you.
528,I don't care about you.
529,I won't wait for you.
530,I bite.
531,Good luck.
532,Jerks. Come here.
533,"Oh, do this. Do that."
534,Our Masters. I'll do what I...
535,Hmm...
536,"I suppose if it was working right, we'd be dead already."
537,Don't ask me to fetch that stick.
538,Fetchi!
539,Fetchi!
540,I'm telling you: I don't fetch.
541,Fetchi!
542,I'm not doing this because you commanded me to.
543,I'm doing it because I feel sorry for you.
544,Good boy.
545,Where'd you get that dog?
546,He looks like me with a pink nose.
547,"I come from a ninedog litter, but they drowned the sisters."
548,We're not a rare breed: shorthairedOceanic speckledear/ sporthoundmix.
549,I'm getting confused now.
550,My belly feels funny.
551,Biscuito.
552,I can't accept that.
553,It's for your dog.
554,I've never been offered a PuppySnap in my life.
555,I don't even know what they taste like.
556,"Okay, I'll try it."
557,Crunchy. Salty.
558,"Supposedly, it cleans your teeth."
559,This is my new favorite food.
560,Thank you.
561,"âª My pale blue star âª âª My rainbow, how good it is to know you're like me âª âª Strike me with your lightning âª âª Bring me down and bury me with ashes âª âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª Cold up here tonight."
562,We'll find him.
563,"Wherever he is, if he's alive: we'll find your dog."
564,"âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª âª I won't hurt you I won't hurt you âª Mayor Kobayashi, elected leader of Megasaki City."
565,"For 150 years, you and your ancestors, known as the Kobayashi Dynasty, a procession of doghating thugs, stooges, felons, and their criminal underlings, have betrayed and deceived the citizens of Uni Prefecture."
566,You make me so mad!
567,"Professor Watanabe, ScienceParty Candidate, deceased."
568,The wasabi in your blood showed poisonlevels in excess of ten times the maximum dosage required to stop the heart of a whale.
569,Why'd you do it?
570,"Atari Kobayashi, adopted ward to the mayoralhousehold."
571,You heroically hijacked a Junior TurboProp XJ750 and flew it to the island...
572,Atari.
573,"You heroically, as I was saying, stole the little airplane, because of your dog and..."
574,I lost my train of thought.
575,Dammit!
576,I've got a crush on you.
577,"Part Three: ""The RendezVous."" Rex! King! Duke! Boss!"
578,You made it!
579,What happened to you?
580,I took a bath.
581,What? He's got soap?
582,Just a little.
583,You're too fluffy.
584, We played fetch.
585, With a stick?
586,With a hunk of rubber radiatortubing.
587,And you brought it back to him?
588,Yeah.
589,He's a good boy.
590,Don't you tell me that!
591,"I'm the one that tried to make you be loyal to him, in the first place."
592,Stop. Stop!
593,This is the rendezvous.
594,Where's that trashtram taking you?
595,You think we booked this ride through a travel agent?
596,We were fighting for our lives in a highvelocity trashprocessor while you were getting scrubbed and brushed.
597, Jump!
598, Where?
599, Here!
600, When?
601, Now!
602, Why?
603,What?
604,Let's take a vote.
605,All in favor of jump...
606,Who's that?
607,I can't smell him.
608,Come in.
609,Master Atari...
610,Can you hear me?
611,Huh?
612,That dog's real.
613,What's that thing in your ear for?
614,Are you hard of hearing?
615,You can't be. Um...
616,Bodyguarddogs have to have just to be certified.
617,"No, the earpiece is how I receive my commands and instructions and so on."
618,"Obviously, I'm privy to certain sensitive information due to my position in the mayoralhousehold at Brick Mansion."
619,"Oh, so you mean somebody could be talking to you right now?"
620,"Well, the range is only about Battery's probably dead, anyway."
621,I got a question for you.
622,How much money do you think the mayor makes?
623,I can't tell you that.
624,That's highly confidential.
625,"Um, anyway, I'm not the mayor's accountant's dog."
626,"That's Butterscotch, and she got crushed in a glass compactor the day before yesterday."
627,"No, my duties are, uh, focused entirely on the protection of the mayor's ward, Atari."
628,"I'm not supposed to be his friend, but I love him very much, but that's a private matter."
629,"Um, the only reason I even said that was because we're all probably going to die out here and I'll never see him again."
630,That's a tough break.
631,"Well, good luck to you and watch out for the cannibaldogs."
632, Hmm?
633, Hmm?
634, What?
635, What?
636,Watch out for the...?
637,The cannibaldogs.
638,They are dogs that eat dogs.
639,Start over and repeat again.
640,You know what?
641,Don't even worry about that.
642,"I just heard there might be some wild, aboriginal, cannibaldogs in the area, you know, but I wouldn't worry because you're in an extrasecurity lock cell."
643,Look at it that way.
644,You're probably safer than I am.
645,Except from thirst and starvation.
646,It's got an extrasecurity lock on it.
647,You'll never get it open.
648,Are you going to eat me now?
649,What did you say?
650,Are you going to eat me now?
651,I heard you were cannibaldogs.
652,Be notified: I'll be compelled to defend myself with all means at my disposal.
653,Hmm.
654,Who told you that dirty lie?
655,"We resorted to cannibalism on one occasion, many months ago, as a desperate survival instinct."
656,We ate one single dog.
657,"His name was Fuzzball, and he was the leader of our pack, and he was already in a coma from starvation,  so we put him out of his..."
658, his...
659,His misery and...
660,and...
661,consumed him.
662,We would have dropped dead in a week or less without that nourishment.
663,We were dying.
664,Do you judge us for that?
665,Shame on you!
666,We only brought you here in the first place to help you.
667,We've got a Master PassKey!
668,Open his cage.
669,Fuzzball was his best friend.
670,"Oh, dear."
671,"Uh, I think I offended him."
672,I'm truly sorry.
673,I had no idea.
674,What is this place?
675,How long have you been here?
676,I can see you've been mistreated.
677,Are you okay?
678,My name is Spots.
679,Spots Kobayashi.
680,How can I be of service to you?
681,"Master Atarisan, can you hear me?"
682,"Can you hear me, Master Atari?"
683,Spotsu?
684,You're not safe here!
685,You shouldn't have come for me!
686,I can't protect you efficiently under these conditions!
687,Spotsu!
688,Here I come.
689,Sic'em!
690,Follow me!
691,"All in favor of kicking Chief out of the pack and never speaking to him again, say ""Aye""."
692,Aye!
693,How did you do that?
694,Secret tooth! Military issue!
695,"Technically, I could do it but I wouldn't be able to chew my meat!"
696,I assume you're Spots!
697,We've been looking for you.
698,"Master Atarisan, I swore an oath when I assumed the responsibilities of official bodyguarddog to the mayoralhousehold!"
699,I could never be persuaded to break that vow for any reason whatsoever!
700,I'll always be loyal to you as my only and unconditional master!
701,But circumstances have radically changed for me and all the pets of Megasaki City!
702,I have new obligations which I never anticipated!
703,"I've become the leader of a tribe of outcasts who depend on me for their survival, and I'm going to be a father!"
704,"With deepest sadness and humility: I must ask you to relieve me of the duties of my position, effective immediately."
705,You son of a bitch.
706,"If we don't drown, I'm going to strangle you myself."
707,I don't care how many exploding teeth you try to spitout at me.
708,Do you have any idea what that little pilot just went through to try to rescue you?
709,How dare you?
710, You're a stray.
711," Yeah, so what?"
712,What's your name?
713,Who cares?
714,You're from central Megasaki.
715,I can tell by the accent.
716,You're a shorthairedOceanic speckleear/sporthoundmix.
717,You were born in a stormsewer on Bambooshoot Holiday six years ago today.
718,Do you know me?
719,I... I don't... I don't know.
720,I'm your older brother by five minutes.
721,"It's been a long time, Chief."
722,Was... Was I the runt?
723,Not anymore.
724,Securitycamera footage confirms initialreports of the deaths of mayoralward Atari Kobayashi and his five dogabductors this afternoon in a sluice channel at the threshold of the FarAway Cuticles.
725,"A statement from MajorDomo, live at Brick Mansion: The life of a promising young orphan has been cut short before its prime."
726,This is a distantuncle's worst nightmare.
727,"Mayor Kobayashi asks for your prayers, your condolences and your support for the diligent men and women of the Municipal Task Force DogCatchers Division: we salute you for your bravery and your ongoing commitment to the continuing punishment of all baddogs."
728,"Originally, before the volcano erupted and an earthquake triggered the tsunami which obliterated the facility, there were over 250 incarcerated animals here on the premises being experimented on against their will."
729,"If you look closely, you may notice some of these dogs still bear scars and markings from the research and abuse."
730,"Actually, it's pretty obvious."
731,"This is my mate, Peppermint."
732,She's pregnant with our first litter.
733,She was due a week ago.
734,"Anyway, the survivors of the disaster learned to cultiv..."
735,What's he got there?
736,What's he got there?
737,Biscuito. Biscuito.
738,Biscuito.
739,PuppySnaps.
740,I heard they don't even make them anymore.
741,"You heard the rumor, right?"
742,About Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.
743,I never heard it.
744,What rumor?
745,They invented DogFlu.
746, No.
747, Of course.
748,That makes sense.
749,Where do you get all these rumors?
750,"I mean, who tells them to you?"
751,I don't know. Anybody.
752,"Dogs talk, and I listen."
753,Always have.
754,"I, uh, love gossip."
755,Spots!
756,The black owl has a message.
757,He's come from all the way across the island.
758,"Get him a cup of sewerwater, Chico."
759,Mmmhmm.
760,Mmmhmm.
761,Yes. We understand.
762,He has news from the Metropolitan DumpingGrounds.
763,Metropolitan...
764,"Shh! Quiet, please."
765,"We're listening, owl."
766,Tell us your message.
767,He's going to poison us.
768,"Reelection Night: at the moment Mayor Kobayashi is reinaugurated, he'll give the order, and the exterminationprocess will begin."
769,Oracle saw the plan in her visions.
770,"If the voters choose me again on ReElection Night, I promise: a final and permanent end to the Canine Saturationcrisis."
771,Every pet in the Trash Island Camp will die.
772,"It may be too late, already; but, if the black owl reaches you with this message in time: Go to Megasaki City."
773,Find our masters.
774,Appeal to the people.
775,Stop the mayor.
776,Save us.
777,We're crossing the river tonight.
778,Begin preparations immediately.
779,You'll meet a bitch named Nutmeg.
780,Tell her Chief says: I'll see you in Megasaki.
781,Hmm.
782,Beautiful night.
783,Peppermint's in labor.
784,Oh.
785,Come sit beside me.
786,It's okay.
787,"Master Atari, are you willing to accept my brother Chief as new bodyguarddog in personal service to you, former ward to the mayoralhousehold?"
788,"Chief, are you willing to accept Atari as your direct master, to serve and protect his safety and welfare with all courage, loyalty and friendship?"
789,I can do that.
790,Good.
791,"Chocolate milk, cold."
792,"Tracy Walker, Megasaki Senior High, DailyManifesto."
793,"Are you Professor Watanabe's former AssistantScientist, Yokoonosan?"
794,Do I have it?
795,Too late.
796,Do I have it?
797,Too late.
798,Nobody care.
799,Do I have it?
800,Do I have the story?
801,Yes or no? On the record!
802,"I am sorry for your loss, but we both know: that was no suicide!"
803,I need to prove my conspiracytheory!
804,Ben is dead.
805,No future on Trash Island.
806,I am failure.
807,Pull yourself together and act like a scientist!
808,Professor Watanabe never gave up.
809,Is this... Is this the serum?
810,The DogFlu cure?
811,The Snoutfever treatment?
812,The end of the Canine Saturationcrisis?
813,Last dose.
814,Tracy: be careful.
815,"Part Four: ""Atari's Lantern."" Not fair!"
816,To dogs!
817, Not fair!
818, To dogs!
819, Not fair!
820, To dogs!
821,There will never be a place for DogFlu in Megasaki City.
822,There will never be room for Snoutfever in Uni Prefecture.
823,"The time has come to put the violent, intimidating, unsanitary baddogs of Trash Island humanely to sleep."
824,For their own good; and also: ours.
825,General Yamatachi?
826,Bring out the replacementpet.
827,Sito!
828,The results are in!
829,Stand by for the incoming ReElection Night tally!
830,That crook!
831,He's stealing the reelection again!
832,Let's go!
833,"This landslide reelection is a massive fraud, and we demand a recount!"
834,Respecto.
835,The mayor is allowing the unauthorized ProDog studentprotestors a platform to voice their dissenting beliefs!
836,Mayor Kobayashi has dog'sblood on his hands! You all do!
837,Atari was a hero.
838,Professor Watanabe was murdered.
839,The serum works!
840,"The mayor is a crook, and I hate him."
841,This small minority of doglovers has been sent by overseas specialinterest groups to agitate disorder and incite anarchy.
842,I hereby cancel and nullify Foreignexchange student Walker's senior high school studyvisa.
843,"She will be expelled from class, stripped of her coursecredits, and formally deported on the next directflight back to Cincinnati, Ohio."
844,Oh. Hmm.
845,Mayor Kobayashi has directed MajorDomo to bring him the red button.
846,Nutmeg!
847,Holy smokes!
848,My lungs feel clear.
849,My equilibrium feels balanced.
850,My vision is sharp as a tack for the first time in months.
851,"Wow, that's a great serum!"
852,"Master Atari, whose death, I think we can say, appears to have been inaccurately reported, has asked to read a statement to the General Assembly."
853,He will then withdraw from the debate and respond to no further questions.
854,"Dear EditorHiroshi of the Megasaki Senior High DailyManifesto: in a series of firstrate articles by an attractive cubreporter on your staff, you shine a spotlight on the great injustice that has occurred under the Kobayashi Administration."
855,"I have spent much of my time in recent weeks traveling in the company of the very kind of animals our mayor refers to as ""baddogs."" They are the finest livingbeings I have ever come to know in all my dozen years on this earth."
856,"To your readers, the good people of Megasaki, I say: the cycle of life always hangs in a delicate balance."
857,"Who are we, and who do we want to be?"
858,Who are we?
859,I wrote a haiku to try to express my feelings about the suffering dogs of Trash Island.
860,"It is also about nature, love, friendship, eternity, and a black owl."
861,I call it: Atari's Lantern.
862,He said a haiku.
863,I'll tell you later.
864,"I dedicate this poem to my distantuncle, Mayor Kobayashi, who took me in when I myself was a straydog with nowhere else to turn."
865,"EditorHiroshi, please extend my subscription for an additional year."
866,I enclose a check in the amount of one thousand yen.
867,"Signed, Atari Kobayashi, former ward to the mayoralhousehold."
868,Hmm.
869,Notfairtotheboy.
870,Notfairtothedog.
871,"He says: ""Ihavenohonor."" Hmm?"
872,Holy Moses!
873,The mayor has just officially unstamped the Trash Island Decree!
874,No kidding!
875,MajorDomo is accusing the mayor of breaking his campaign promise!
876,He's steaming mad!
877,It's gonna be a fight!
878,Spit him with a tooth!
879,I can't get a clean shot.
880,Too many innocent protesters.
881,I'll be right back.
882,Escape!
883,Escape! Escape!
884,Escape!
885,"Well, the brain surgery was a complete success."
886,But his left kidney failed due to the stress of the operation.
887,"But, what about the right one?"
888,He lost it in a traincrash three years ago.
889,Take my left kidney...
890,give it to Atarikun.
891,"According to a longstanding statute unique to Uni Prefecture, in the event of the death, disappearance, or felonyprosecution of the chosen candidate on, while, during, or concurrent with the ReElectionNight ceremony, all powers and authorities vested in his or her designated office transfer forthwith to his or her nextofkin and/or appointed heir."
892,"In other words, Atari Kobayashi is the new mayor of Megasaki City!"
893,You heard me right: Atari Kobayashi is the new mayor of Megasaki City!
894,Let's hope that new kidney works.
895,"Boy, what a night!"
896,Life in Uni Prefecture returned to a comfortable tranquility.
897,The Megasaki Dragons ended their winning streak with a staggering loss to the Honda Goblins.
898,DoggyChop reopened all 11 of its domestic factories and PuppySnaps resumed production with an improved product.
899,"Graft and political corruption were reduced to sustainable, acceptable levels."
900,The DogFlu serum cured every breathinganimal in the region.
901,Some say a few lostdogs continue to roam and scavenge on Trash Island.
902,"However, these rumors remain unconfirmed."
903,"Mayor Atari, we all agree it should be a crime to abuse, beat, murder or yell at any dog in Megasaki City."
904,That is not the question.
905,The question is: what is the appropriate punishment?
906,Exactly. And the answer is: Death Penalty.
907,That seems excessive to us.
908,"Possibly. Anyway, we should make it at least 30 days communityservice and a fine of no less than 250,000 yen."
909,Meeting adjourned.
910,"I'm standingby, Master Atari."
911,So how does it feel to be a former stray?
912,Hmm. I take it one day at a time.
913,"Last week, I nearly behanded an industrial lobbyist from West Suzuki."
914,They had to give him a blood transfusion.
915,He probably had it coming.
916,Maybe. Learned any new tricks?
917,"Actually, yes. Just one."
918,Can I see it?
919,"I'm supposed to be juggling ten bowlingpins engulfed in flames over my tail at this point, but you just have to imagine that part."
920,I can picture it.
921,You still against bringing puppies into this world?
922,I'll tell you when I get to know you better.
923,Fair enough.
924,"My friends think I like to fight, but it's just not true."
925,"Sometimes I lose my temper and blow off a little steam, but I've never enjoyed it."
926,I'm not a violent dog.
927,I don't know why I bite.
928,I'm not attracted to tame animals.
929,Thank you.
