325,Looks like he landed on his face.
326,Oh!
327,"You know, Uncle Paul, maybe you need help around here."
328,groaning No.
329,It's nothing a little ice won't take care of.
330, Maybe you should sit down for a minute.
331, Oh!
332,"Ruby, go get an ice pack for Uncle Paul."
333, Paul Good idea.
334, Izzy Come on.
335,Okay. Let's go.

338,Ow.
339,"sighs Okay, whew."
340,"Look, I know you guys didn't come all the way over here to take care of this old fella, so I can tell something's bothering you."
341,"Well, it's kind of a long story."
342,"Our parents are getting a divorce, and we need your help."
343,"Well, that pretty much sums it up."
344,"Well, I'm sorry to hear that, guys."
345,"Really, I am."
346,"Look, I know you're a little young to understand this, but sighs relationships are complicated."
347,"Your parents have been dealing with this for a while, and there's only so much I can do."
348,They need to be willing to do the work.
349,Clearly they're not working hard enough.
350,Paul Well.
351,Here you go!
352,Oh.
353,Goodness.
354,"Let's move this down to my feet, and I got something for you."
355,"Uncle Paul, focus."
356,We need serious help.
357,"Well, patience, child."
358,Okay.
359,Can we pray or something?
360,Isn't that what pastors do?
361,"I can pray, you can pray, and your parents can pray."
362,"Okay, which one?"
363,"That one for you, and that for you."
364,"And so what we're gonna do, take this string, and you're gonna hold it really tight."
365,"Hold it tight, hold it tight."
366,And you're going to pull and just like that.
367,Not very strong.
368,Right?
369,And then we go to the purple one.
370,Watch the purple one.
371,Watch.
372,"There's a little string right here, and you're gonna hold this really tight."
373,"Yep, yep. Really tight."
374,So beautiful.
375,"Oh, my goodness."
376,Look.
377,"And then we're gonna twist it together with this green one, and you're gonna hold it tight, and look, it's a little stronger."
378,"Pull, pull, pull."
379, You can't get it.
380," string snaps Oh, my goodness, that was strong."
381,Wasn't it?
382,But it still comes undone.
383,"And now, let's go to the gold one."
384,"And when we take three strings, we're gonna twist that together, and it all of a sudden becomes a lot stronger."
385,And so that's what happens when you put God in the center of a marriage.
386,It becomes that much stronger.
387,That's what'll happen if our parents pray?
388,It's a start.
389,But they're going to court in two days.
390,"Listen, I think what your parents need is time."
391,"And I've got a buddy that owes me a favor, and I think that he can help give your parents the time that they need."
392,Is this person a pastor like you?
393,"Well, not exactly."
394,Hi!
395, I'm Donovan Marshall.

423,"Come on, Ruby."
424,We can't afford those commercials.
425,We can't even afford this office.
426,We were perfectly fine in my father's garage.
427,You're not thinking big enough.

443,Can I get you anything to drink?
444," kids Yes, please!"
445," Oh, well, that's not necessary."
446,They're not staying very much longer.
447,Professional.
448,What are you doing?
449,"Okay, kids."
450,I'm afraid I don't have any lollipops. chuckling We're not here for candy.
451,We need a lawyer.
452,"Look, I'm a personal injury attorney."
453,"I work with people who've actually been injured somehow, so..."
454,But we have been injured!
455,And hurt!
456,snickers Yes! Now we're talking.
457,"I mean, how unfortunate."
458,Our parents are getting a divorce.
459,It's gonna mess everything up.
460,It hurts our feelings.
461,I'm not following here.
462,"Sorry. chuckles  You're a lawyer, right?"
463, Yes.
464,We want you to sue them or something.
465,"Make it so they can't get a divorce, or at least not right away."
466,They need time.
467,Time for what?
468,For our parents to figure it out.
469,So they can start praying for each other.
470,"Oh! You want me to intervene in an ongoing court proceedings and file an injunction, thus delaying your parents' divorce."
471,Yes! Can you do it?
472,Donovan chuckles Not a chance.
473,But why?
474,"One, I don't do divorces."
475,"Two, what you're asking will probably get me disbarred."
476,"And three, most important, no one in this scenario has any money."
477," No! No, please."
478," Really, no, please."
479, Donovan No.
480, My watch is worth a pretty penny.
481,"No, it's not, really."
482," Out. Let's go, let's go."
483, Thanks for nothing!
484," Come on, Ruby."
485," Ooh, okay!"
486,And thank you too!
487,All right.
488,"Ah, that's a feisty little one."
489," Oh, excuse me."
490, Mmmmm.
491, All right. I gotta...
492, Mmmmm. Mmmmm.
493, What are you doing?
494, You owe our friend a visit.
495,Go. Just go.
496," grumbles  Go, go, go."
497, Do I have to?
498," Yes, you do."
499, Go.
500, grumbling continues This will be good for you!
501,"Donovan Yeah, yeah, yeah."
502,That was a neat trick you pulled today.
503,"Hey, Donovan, old buddy, old pal."
504,"Long time, no see."
505,"Don't ""old buddy, old pal"" me, okay?"
506,"You're meddling again, and I'm not biting."
507,I don't know what you're talking about.
508,You know exactly what I'm talking about.
509,"You know, you can use zip ties to hang this, right?"
510,I think duct tape works just the same.
511,Clearly.
512,"Paul grunts Look, this is a chance for you to help the helpless."
513,"I mean, don't you already say that in your commercials?"
514,"Yeah, I already do that. Okay?"
515,"""I've collected millions on their behalf."" chuckling I bet you have."
516,chuckles I know.
517,sighs This is different.
518,"Well, you met the kids."
519,You see how the idea of divorce affects them.
520,You're still trying to save the world.
521,"Nah, just my family."
522,So what do you need me for?
523,"If you want to help them, why don't you just help them?"
524,It's not that easy.
525,My sister is not so inclined to get help from her big brother.
526,"Look, come on."
527,"Help an old buddy, old pal out."
528,"Paul, have you ever heard of no fault?"
529,"I mean, courts can't force people to stay married."
530,"Yeah, no fault is unilateral divorce."
531,It's when one spouse acting alone forces the other into a divorce.
532,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

546,Who has Mr. Lambert retained?
547,"Well, I think my husband..."
548,Okay. Right there.
549,Don't think of him as your husband ever again.
550,"From this day forward, he is the defendant."
551,Okay.
552,"I think Brent, the defendant, hired an old college friend, Hayden Grimes."
553,He was actually best man at our wedding.
554,Grimes?
555,That guy is...
556,man Evil.
557,Claire Hudgens.
558,That woman is blackhearted.
559,"I don't know what you did to Sarah, but if she hired Claire, it must have been pretty bad."
560,chuckling Grimes.
561,It's not like that at all.
562,"I mean, I think Sarah knows her from a book club or something."
563," Women getting together and talking, it's bad news."
564, chuckles It's bad news for men.
565,"You are funny, man."
566,It's not like that.
567,It's Sarah!

622, What does that mean?
623, We have a lawyer!

682,Your boss is a woman?
683, Yeah.
684, Ah. Say no more.
685,"Is he always this late? I mean, this could be an issue with alimony and child support."
686,"Well, he's usually on time, but lately, I don't know."
687,You're still making excuses for him.
688,Let me tell you something about men.
689,Women are processoriented.
690,It's not about the destination.
691,It's about the journey.
692,Men are goaloriented.
693,"For them, it's about completing the task, checking it off and moving on to the next thing."
694,That's why they change so much during marriage.
695,"You were once a goal, and now, you've been checked off."
696,"All we want is to be done, to be finished, to have all the work behind us."
697,But you're never done with a woman.
698,She resets at midnight.
699,"You begin each day at zero, my friend."
700,papers rustle Claire They're complacent and lazy.
701,"They need us to tell them what time to come home, whether their clothes match or not, or if they like broccoli."
702,"Hayden No matter how great a sacrifice, or what a wonderful husband you've been over the last 20 years, none of that matters now."
703,"You may think you have points from the past, but you would be a fool to think you've accumulated any."
704,All rise!
705,The honorable Judge Heavener presiding.
706,Sit down.
707,"Both of you, front and center."
708,I thought I made it clear when I said I never wanted to see the both of you together in my courtroom again.
709,"Yes, Judge."
710,"Imagine my shock when I discovered that Ms. Hudgens here had agreed to represent the plaintiff,  knowing very well..."
711, Your Honor.
712,"Mrs. Lambert... Sarah and I are longtime acquaintances, and I can assure you that she retained my services long before Mr. Grimes."
713,I was Brent's best man.
714,Give me a break!
715,Unless the defendant is capable of precognition.
716,Enough!
717,"One outburst, one childish display, and I will find you both in contempt."
718,"Now, sit down."
719, In the matter of the marriage of Brent A. Lambert...
720, What's all that about?
721,"...and Sarah C. Lambert, we come to the preliminary hearing before the state court."
722,Are the parties and their attorneys prepared to proceed?
723," Yes, Judge."
724," Yes, Your Honor."
725,"Then by all means, please do."
726,"Your Honor, this is a case of a stayathome mom requesting the right to continue to do so."
727, The defendant...
728, I object!
729,You can't object to an opening statement.
730,I object to your tone.
731,My tone is no more on trial than your mismatched shirt and tie.
732, So arrogant.
733, Heavener Quiet!
734, You so drive me crazy!
735, I'm arrogant?
736, gavel raps  I will have order!
737,"rapping continues Now, we are going to proceed in an orderly and professional manner as befits the respectful nature of what we're doing."
738,"Western music playing Your honor, my name is Donovan Marshall, and I represent the children of the litigants."
739,I request permission to be able to represent and sit in on these hearings.
740, My kids hired an attorney?
741, Hayden It's unlikely.
742,It's clearly a tactic employed by opposing counsel.
743,I don't understand.
744,What do the kids have to do with this?
745,Nothing. Children have no adversary interest in a divorce action.
746,This is an obvious ploy to derail our proceedings.
747,Would someone care to tell me what's going on here?
748,"Your Honor, as unlikely as it may seem, I can hardly agree that the children have no interest."
749,"Why, half this petition concerns itself with custody, visitation, child support and schooling."
750,"And as such, I believe children are entitled to representation."
751,I've seen your commercials.
752, I know who you are.
753," Yes, Judge."
754,I don't like you.
755,It's understandable.
756,And I won't let you join Moe and Curly over here and turn my courtroom into a threering circus.
757,Noted.
758,"Your Honor, it may please you to know that I plan to navigate the litigants out of your courtroom and into family mediation."
759, Mediation?
760, Yes.
761,"You mean to say, if I let you sit in today, that the three of you will just disappear?"
762,"Well, that's the plan."
763,Okay.
764,This court will consider you the guardian ad litem for the children of Brent and Sarah Lambert.
765,"And as such, you will be permitted to participate in these proceedings."
766,"But let me remind you, counsel, this courtroom is no place for cheap Hollywood theatrics."
767,"laughs Well, of course, Your Honor."
768,I have nothing but respect for the sanctity of this courtroom and the judiciary process.
769,reporters clamoring Is it true you're championing marriages by representing children in divorce cases?
770,"chuckles Well, you see, I collect..."
771,I fight for those who cannot defend themselves.
772,reporter Are you embarking on a crusade to preserve families?
773,"Donovan Well, I..."
774,Andrew Anything yet?
775,"No, maybe I'll just text Bianca. Hi!"
776,Your mother and I would like an explanation.
777,We're not supposed to discuss the case.
778,"That's not gonna cut it, Izzy."
779,Sit down.
780,Your dad and I understand that you are having some difficulties with what we're going through.
781,"But what you guys did today, that's not the way you handle it."
782,What do you mean?
783, What do I mean?
784, By hiring a lawyer!
785,And going to court.
786,That's not how families deal with their problems.
787,Isn't that what you two are doing?
788,"sighs Look, I didn't want to get a divorce."
789, But your mother says that she's unhappy.
790, What?
791," No, you're gonna blame me for this?"
792," No, no."
793,You're not gonna take any responsibility for this relationship?
794, I'm not blaming you. I'm just stating a fact.
795, But you just did.
796,You can't just say that in front of our kids  and say that I'm the one that wanted a divorce.
797, I'm not blaming you.
798," Yes, you..."
799, You said to me that you are unhappy.
800,But we live like roommates.
801, That's why we're getting...
802, But did you or did you not tell me...
803, arguing continues  Excuse me!
804,We're still in the room!
805,Brent sighs I'm sorry.
806,That was wrong of us.
807,I'm sorry.
808,"Look, you guys are just gonna have to trust us to make the right decisions."
809,"Always remember, we are on your side."
810,"""Remember we're on your side""?"
811,What does that even mean?
812,Who put my socks in the underwear drawer?
813, phone dings  Guys!
814,Mr. Marshall said Mom and Dad are going to do mediation.
815,Meditation?
816,"No, mediation."
817,It just means they can't get a divorce for now.
818,Holy macaroni.

827, Uh. Carla.
828,But what would you say to your detractors who claim that what you're doing is nothing more than a selfserving publicity stunt?
829,"You know what, Meredith? Petty as it may be, jealousy is rampant in my profession."
830,Let me tell ya.
831,"Although it is, and I understand that."
832,"I mean, what you do I could never do, uh, but this is a nofault state, and children can't legally stop their parents from divorcing."
833,What do you have to say about that?
834,"chuckling Well, you know I cannot discuss the details of my ongoing case, Savannah, but what I can say is this, the children... the children are my main priority."
835,"Well, thank you, Mr. Marshall."

853,Their parents are calling too.
854,Hmm.
855,They're accusing you of giving their children false hope.
856," scoffs  Actually, the bar is considering to review your practice."
857, Ooh.
858, You don't even have a plan.
859,"chuckles Oh, Bianca, of course I have a plan."
860,It's already in motion.
861,This case will go away.
862,They'll figure it all out in mediation.

876,"It's not good for us, Brent, especially now that things are so fragile."
877,It makes us look unstable.
878, Like we might not be up to the task.
879," Well, that was..."
880,That was unintentional.
881,"My, my kids have..."
882,Your private life is incidental.

1058, Hi.
1059,Uh...
1060,Is this a party for Harlan Hames?
1061,It is.
1062,Yes. Great.
1063,Nobody's wearing a tuxedo.
1064,"âª Hey, hey there, baby Something just ain't right âª It's not really a tuxedo kind of establishment."
1065,"Uh, yeah, well, my friend dropped off a tuxedo for you to give to me."
1066,A short guy.
1067,But nobody's wearing a tuxedo.
1068,"You know it's not a pajama party either, right?"
1069,"In hindsight, I realize it was wrong to interfere without talking to you first."
1070,"But... the kids, they just tugged at my heart."
1071,So I reached out to an old college buddy of mine in hopes that he would be able to connect me with you and Brent.
1072,So this was all your idea?
1073,"Well, I mean, not entirely."
1074,I didn't know that Donovan was gonna create such a media circus.
1075,"Look, I know you don't always want advice from your older brother, but in my opinion, divorce isn't always the option that people think it is."
1076,So I'm just supposed to stay in a miserable marriage?
1077,Is it really that miserable?
1078,"I mean, I recall two lovebirds that couldn't get enough of each other."
1079,chuckles Yeah.
1080,I did fall in love with him.
1081,But we're just so different now.
1082,sighs Marriage is a loyal partnership.
1083,Do you really think God would leave you with just two options?
1084,Misery or divorce?
1085,That's a myth.
1086,Well...
1087,the children deserve to live in a home where their parents aren't fighting all the time.
1088,The children deserve to live in a home where their parents learn to not fight with each other.
1089,"Well, we're meeting with the mediator tomorrow, and I don't even know where to start."
1090,"Sarah, you can get a divorce."
1091,"That is an option that is certainly available to you, but you owe it to yourself and to your children to be honest about why you're doing it."
1092,"sighs âª Baby, tell me who she is âª Great band."
1093,Mm. Little Sue and the Cow Tippers.
1094, Oh.
1095, That's Tony on the drums.
1096,He's my cousin.
1097," Oh, that's great."
1098, Yeah.
1099," Listen, Chelsea... May I call you Chelsea?"
1100, Of course.
1101,"I've been kicking this around for a long time now, and, you know, I have to say, it's not like I love Dolva Tech."
1102,"You know, like a cat loves a cream jar."
1103,"But I have to say, right now, Dolva Tech's offer's better than Peterson's."
1104,"And I got 2,000 loyal employees I look after."
1105,"It's 500 individuals, and 300 or 400 grandchildren."
1106,You know how many people that is?
1107,It's...
1108,"It's a lot of people, and they're gonna still need their jobs after I retire."
1109,"Oh, these here, these are my favorites."
1110,Mm. Can't get enough of them.
1111, You want some?
1112," No, thank you."
1113, Mr. Hames...
1114," Oh, hey, Chelsea, call me Harlan."
1115,Consider allowing Brent Lambert to review Dolva Tech's offer.
1116,Brent is our chief strategist in acquisitions.
1117,"If he fails to convince you that Peterson is a better home for your company, then my job is done, and I wish you and Dolva Tech great success, with no hard feelings."
1118,"That's mighty big of you, Chelsea."
1119,You seem to have a lot of confidence in this Brent fella.
1120," Mm. He's levelheaded, reliable."
1121, And late.
1122,âª Waiting on you to come home âª I think I see the people I'm looking for.
1123,Excuse me.
1124,"muttering Excuse me, I'm so sorry."

1129,"Ms. Dwyer, do you know this fella?"
1130,"Brent, what's come over you?"
1131, stammering I can explain.
1132," You know what, son?"
1133,Pink's your color.
1134,I've been looking for slippers like that.
1135,"Well, I'm..."
1136,I'm a little bit confused here.
1137,Nobody's dressed in a tuxedo.
1138,"Who wears a tux to a barbecue, Brent?"
1139,Brent You told me that this was a...
1140,I told you to be here on time!
1141,And now you mocked me in front of our client by showing up looking like some insane person.
1142, What?
1143, Is this alcohol? Drugs?
1144,We're gonna get you help.
1145," All right, come on."
1146, Brent muttering Come on.
1147,"Come on, buddy."
1148,I am so sorry.
1149,I think the pressure just got to him.
1150,That's a crying shame when a grown man buckles like that.
1151,âª Waitin' on you to come home âª engine starts woman sighs Divorce is such a harsh word.
1152,I prefer the term matrimonial restructuring.
1153,"And as your courtappointed mediator, and in the spirit of harmony, I would like to welcome you both."
1154,"Oh, would either of you care for some organic hibiscusinfused moon tea?"
1155,How much?
1156,"Oh, a single cup should interface your chakra and body mind, allowing for..."
1157,How much is this going to cost?
1158," Oh, I see."
1159," teapot clinks Well, I recommend a minimum of two 90minute sessions per week, spread out over three to five months."

1162, I've had enough.
1163, Brent!
1164,"That's a ""no"" to the tea?"
1165,"What are we doing, Sarah?"
1166,Really?
1167,Our kids are out of control.
1168,I've lost my job.
1169,And here we are spending everything just to see who gets what's left.
1170,None of this was my idea.
1171,"Actually, this was all your idea."
1172,sighs Can't we just agree that the both of us have made mistakes and move on from there?
1173,You know what?
1174,Forget it.
1175,"What, just like that?"
1176,You're just gonna walk away?
1177,"We didn't have any help to get married, and we sure as heck don't need anybody's help to get divorced."
1178,"latch rattles  slurps tea Mm, I'm so sorry."

1187,"I guess, from the looks of it, your dad's having a nervous breakdown."
1188,"Word on the street is he lost his job last night, and he showed up to a charity event in a nightgown and fuzzy slippers."
1189,Did you say a charity event?

1203,Okay?
1204,"Look, I said I'd buy you some time, and that's what I did."
1205,"I said from the start, there's no way to stop a couple from divorcing."
1206,They have to decide that on their own.
1207,It's time you kids accept that. Okay?
1208,"It's okay, Mr. Marshall."

1245,Paul...
1246,why is it so hard?
1247,"Well, did you think that turning your world upside down would be easy?"
1248,"I mean, tons of people get divorced every day."
1249,That's the point.
1250,None of this is gonna be easy.
1251,"I mean, nobody wins in a divorce except the attorneys."
1252,This is tearing us apart.
1253,"Well, that's exactly what is supposed to be happening."
1254,"Look, God develops this redemptive plan for the world, and divorce just tears at the heart of it."
1255,"Yeah, but I don't think you know our situation."
1256,"Maybe I don't, but your kids came to me because they saw something that you don't."
1257,And maybe your marriage is just so beyond fixable that there's just no reason to try any longer.
1258,"Uh, look, I'm sorry that we haven't been close."

1475,I'll give you to the end of my drink.
1476,Okay.
1477,"Uh, Dolva Tech plans on chopping up Allied United Farms and selling it off in bits and pieces."
1478,I'm almost certain of it.
1479,"Also, I believe, and I can't prove this, that Chelsea was playing both sides."
1480,"She sits on the board on one of Dolva Tech's subsidiaries and stands to make a lot of money from the sale of their stock, which is why she sabotaged the sale for Peterson."
1481,"But she needed to cover her tracks, which is why she set me up, sir."
1482,"And, honestly, Mr. Hames, if I wasn't so preoccupied with my divorce, I would have seen this much sooner."
1483,And...
1484,"if I wasn't so preoccupied with my work, I would have spent more time with my wife, and I wouldn't be in this position."

1489,I'm the one accountable.
1490,Hmm. Yeah.
1491,"Well, blame and accountability are two different things."
1492,"To be accountable, well, that's to be responsible for fixing things when they go haywire."
1493,"And blame, that's the price you pay from running away from responsibility."
1494,Yeah.
1495," I like you, Brent."
1496, Thank you.
1497,"I'll have my boys check this out, and if what you say holds water..."
1498,heads are gonna roll.
1499,"I appreciate that, sir."
1500,"Um, excuse me."
1501,"Okay. Goodbye, Mom. Love you."
1502,That was Mom.
1503, She didn't sound very happy.
1504," Well, what are we gonna do?"
1505,We can't let them go to court tomorrow.
1506,"We could try ""Ruby's got a fever."" That always works."
1507,"Tricks aren't going to work this time, guys."
1508,It's up to them.
1509,One can be overpowered.
1510,Ruby Two can defend their selves.
1511,Andrew But a cord of three is not easily broken.

1516," Yes, Judge."
1517,Heavener I see.
1518,"And what's your dog in the hunt here, Mr. Marshall?"
1519,"Well, Your Honor, it is my clients' wishes to withdraw their petition for injunction and let these proceedings proceed unencumbered."
1520,Heavener A sensible decision.
1521,"Well, since there are no further objections in the matter of Lambert vs. Lambert, I hereby order a decree for divorce shall be..."
1522,"Uh, provided, of course, that the litigants can provide satisfactory evidence to that end."
1523,Excuse me?
1524,"Well, Your Honor, may I draw the court's attention to California Code 598.5 subsection 1, paragraph G, which states, ""The trial petitioner must present satisfactory evidence that there has been a breakdown of the marriage relationship and that there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved."" Now, in light of the fact that petitioner Sarah Lambert has not provided such evidence, I ask the court that may she provide this evidence now?"
1525,All right.
1526,"I'll allow it, but make it quick, Counselor."
1527,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1528,"Mrs. Lambert, if you will."
1529,I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
1530,Simply explain to the court why your marriage is so broke that you feel it is not worth your time or effort to repair it.
1531,Nothing good is coming out of this.
1532,"Well, I wouldn't exactly put it like that."
1533,"Well, how would you put it, Mrs. Lambert?"
1534,Was there adultery?
1535,"No, never."
1536,Donovan Were either you or Mr. Lambert sentenced to prison?
1537,Is there allegations of abuse?
1538,"What? No, you have it all wrong."
1539,Oh. I've got it all wrong.
1540,"Well, then enlighten us, Mrs. Lambert."
1541,Please explain to us why we're all here today.
1542,sighs I felt so alone.
1543,Donovan Hmm.
1544,"And you thought by divorcing your husband, that's gonna make you feel less alone?"
1545,"No, I just wanted Brent to prioritize our marriage and make me feel important as much as the kids and his job."
1546,"And you thought by nagging him, by blaming him, by withholding your love and support for him..."
1547,"Mr. Marshall, I find your tone unnecessarily hostile."
1548, I just wanted him to...
1549," To what, Mrs. Lambert? To what?"
1550, Just to...
1551, To stand up.
1552,She just wanted me to stand up for us.
1553,And don't ever talk to my wife like that again.
1554,Mr. Lambert.
1555,"Brent Your Honor, I..."
1556,I thought the value of a man was measured by how hard he worked and how quickly he climbed the ladder of success.
1557,"But what's funny is as soon as I got kicked off that ladder, the only thing I could think about was... my wife and kids."
1558,Last night wasn't a trip down memory lane.
1559,"Our kids were trying to remind me, reminds us, of... the love we had."
1560,And... the love that we've taken for granted.
1561,And the love that's still there to be rediscovered.
