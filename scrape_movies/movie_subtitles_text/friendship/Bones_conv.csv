1,"You're not drownin' there, are you, Tess?"
2,You wish.
3,You're gonna be late for school.
4,Thanks for getting the skim this time.
5,"Don't make sense to me, pay money for that."
6,It seems only water.
7,I thought you were supposed to be in school?
8,No. There's a substitute.
9,She just puts on a movie.
10,I'll go tomorrow.
11,You want some?
12,"No, I'm not long finished my lunch."
13,Lisa asked me to move in.
14,'Kay...
15,What am I supposed to do then?
16,"I don't know, girl."
17,"You're old enough to stay here by yourself, aren't you? It is your house."
18,She's got a spare room: Danny's old room.
19,I can ask about it if you want.
20,"Anyway, I'm sure she wouldn't mind if you stayed there."
21,I'll think about it.
22,Gerry and I are moving into Lisa's.
23,You're movin' in to Lisa Sharpe's?
24,Yeah. Gerry wants to.
25,I don't know.
26,"He's like, so weird about me staying at home alone, so I'm just goin' with it."
27,So you're gonna live in Danny Sharpe's house?
28, Yeah.
29, I think my sister still has his CD. I can steal it for you if you want.
30,Yeah.
31,That'd be wicked.
32,"Tess, you mind staying back for a minute?"
33,OK.
34,I'm glad to see you back in school.
35,You missed a lot of days.
36,I didn't miss that many.
37,"Tess, if you miss many more, you're not gonna be able to graduate."
38,Listen... I know it's been a really hard year.
39,I could set up a meeting with the guidance counsellor.
40,Just to talk.
41,I think it might help.
42,"No. I'll graduate. Oh, God."
43,This fella's still kicking!
44,"Hand me up the axe there, would you?"
45,Ugh...
46,He's a lively bugger.
47, You're a good luck charm.
48, Yeah.
49,Not for rabbits.
50,"You're really hot, you know that?"
51, Uh...
52, You're the hottest girl  in our class.
53," No, I'm not."
54,One of the hottest at least.
55,I've been thinking about coming up here with you all day.
56,Feel how excited I am.
57,"You like me, right?"
58,Put your hand on my dick.
59,"You're not afraid, are you?"
60,No.
61,Lisa? Hey!
62,Me and Tess are here.
63,"I was just, uh, changing the lightbulb."
64,"Oh, I haven't even showered yet."
65,I'm just back from the plant.
66,"Can I get you something to drink, Tess?"
67,Uh... juice? Soft drink?
68,"No, thanks."
69,Go ahead.
70,There's extra blankets and stuff in the hall closet if you need 'em.
71,Thanks.
72,"âª There'll be gray skies âª âª Long on the lonely nights âª âª Whole world can pass on by âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª âª Say goodbye âª âª To all the good, the air we're breathing âª âª One last time âª Just look at him."
73,Isn't he so cute?
74, I brought this for you.
75, Mm!
76,Here. You can have my seat.
77, Do you want a beer?
78, I got one.
79, You having fun?
80, Best kind.
81,Don't look like it.
82,Why aren't you dancin'?
83,Why aren't you dancin'?
84,I brought you a gift.
85,Tiny bit of luck.
86,My sister makes keychains out of 'em.
87,Thanks.
88,I think he likes you.
89,He told Mattie he wants to hook up with you.
90,Do it.
91,Is this the lineup for the bathroom?
92," Oh, hey."
93, Nice night.
94,"Yeah. Um, I was just peein' and goin' back in."
95, Wanna smoke?
96," No, thanks."
97, Do you wanna go in?
98, Let's stay out here for a bit.
99,I'm supposed to dance with Tracey next.
100,It's our song. Shania Twain.
101,"She loves it, but I don't really like it."
102,"I used to like it, but..."
103,"We're supposed to dance, so..."
104,I think I hear someone.
105,No one's out here.
106,Don't worry.
107,I don't want anyone to see us.
108,"Ah, it's cold. So cold."
109,I'm surprised you actually came tonight.
110,Thought I scared you off the other day.
111,You didn't scare me.
112,Prove it.
113,See? Scared.
114,Oh!
115,Hello?
116,Anyone home?
117,"âª Well, the sky has fallen âª âª This time, it's for real âª âª Everybody's been talking âª âª Like it's a pretty big deal âª âª My neighbour's been babblin' âª âª Over there on his knees âª âª Something about the fi... âª Hello?"
118,Who the fuck are you?
119,Who am I? Who are you?
120,What are you doin' rootin' around in the cupboards?
121,Getting a cigarette.
122,Well?
123,I'm Tess.
124,"Well, hello, Tess."
125,What're you doing in my mother's house?
126,Danny?
127,Yeah.
128,"So what are you, my fuckin' sister  or something? What?"
129, No!
130,Well?
131,I moved in here with Gerry.
132,He goes out with Lisa.
133,Who's Gerry?
134,Gerry O'Neal.
135,My mother goes out with Gerry fuckin' O'Neal?
136, Yep.
137, What's he to you?
138,"He's my mom's boyf... well, like, was my mom's boyfriend."
139,She's dead.
140,Who's your mama?
141,Shelly... Small.
142,"Shelly Small's dead, huh?"
143,"Hey, you wanna sit?"
144,You wanna sit?
145,'Kay.
146,They're out.
147,I saw. Potluck.
148,Where'd you come from?
149,"Lisa, I'm told."
150,Where were you at last night?
151,To get that...
152,A cabin party.
153,It was stupid though.
154, Why was it stupid?
155, I don't know.
156,It was just stupid.
157,No fun in the cabin?
158,We had a dandy cabin in the backwoods there.
159,"Just made out of scrap, really."
160,But we had lots of fun.
161,"Left the stove on one night, burnt it to the ground."
162,Stood around and roasted hot dogs over it.
163,Well... I suppose this place is a bit more crowded than I expected.
164,Do you sleep in my room?
165,You don't have a place to stay?
166,No worries.
167, I'm OK.
168, You could stay out at my house if you want.
169,There's no one there.
170," No, I..."
171, Really! And it's a mess but...
172,"I mean, it's not fancy or anything but you could stay there."
173,Ahem.
174,"Yeah, alright. Yeah."
175, Yeah?
176, I'll get the key.
177,It's the green and white one that's across from the plant.
178,Do you know it?
179,"Yeah, I do."
180,"Well, there you go."
181,"Ahem. Well, thank you."
182,It's... nothin'.
183,"Well, I'll go."
184,I'll just get on then.
185,OK.
186,Holy shit.
187,What?
188,Lisa's young fella showed up today.
189,He said that you let him stay at your mother's house.
190,"Yeah. It was empty anyway, so."
191,"That's kind of fuckin' strange, don't you think?"
192, What're you getting on with?
193," Well, he's been gone for nearly 20 years."
194,Must be he wants  money or something.
195, Oh!
196,I'm sure Lisa would love to hear you say that.
197,You don't know anything about him.
198,"If he's here, he's lookin' for something."
199,Maybe he just wants to see his mom.
200,How long is he stayin'?
201," Hey, Ger? You home?"
202," Yeah, I'm up here."
203, I'm sorry if I woke you up.
204, No.
205,It's OK.
206,I was pretty much awake.
207,You wanna come in?
208,I just gotta run up and get something if that's OK?
209," Yeah, it's your house."
210, Thanks.
211,Stupid bear!
212,You hungry?
213,I gotta go to school.
214,At least stay for a cup of tea?
215,Yeah?
216,You saw your mom?
217,"I did, yeah."
218,It was strange.
219,"She... she's a lot smaller than she looms in my head, I tell you."
220,She'll bring me to supper on Friday.
221,So you're staying a while then?
222,"Yeah, for a week maybe."
223,"I... I mean, if that's all right."
224,"Yeah, yeah. Sure."
225,"It's a shitty couch to stay on, though."
226,I don't mind.
227,What's all the news around these parts these days?
228,Uh...
229,"You, mostly."
230, Oh yeah?
231, Yeah.
232,Is that good news or bad?
233,Ahem.
234,I'm going for a walk.
235,"I'll look into the barns in a bit, if you wants to join me."
236,Sure.
237,What you looking for?
238,I don't know.
239,I was looking for shrooms.
240,Used to get a lot of 'em up here years ago.
241,We used to get ripped...
242,ripped on 'em.
243,"Yeah, I... I found some  the other day."
244, You be careful with them. They're powerful little friggers.
245,Who was that?
246,I don't know.
247,"Well... in about 15 minutes, the whole harbour's gonna be talking about how Tess Small was up in the woods with Danny Sharpe."
248,"You should, uh, drop by again sometime."
249," That was fun, hey?"
250, Yeah.
251,I will.
252,You can sleep in my room if you want.
253,"My mom's room, I..."
254,usually keep that closed.
255,OK. Yeah.
256,"It's really good of you, what you been doing for Danny."
257,Oh. It's no trouble.
258,It just made sense.
259,He said you've been really nice to him.
260,Thanks.
261,Did you have a nice visit?
262,Yeah.
263,"It's something strange, seeing him like that, he's all grown up."
264,He's a man.
265,Got himself all straightened out.
266,Told me he's coming for supper later in the week.
267,He is!
268,You'll be here for it.
269,You know...
270,"With me and Gerry together, it's almost like you and Danny are brother and sister."
271,Pass it here.
272,I used to collect things from here when I was little.
273,Like... beach rocks and feathers and shells and stuff.
274,I'd bring them home and my mom was... she'd get so cracked.
275,She said they were filthy.
276,I was down here a lot when I was a young fella too.
277,I spent a lot of time alone.
278,I was there out by the river one time.
279,"I was about 12, I suppose."
280,"You know, where the sewage runs in there."
281,All the toilet paper up on the rocks like little mummies.
282,Used to remind me of mummies.
283,I saw...
284,I saw a little face in the river.
285,"I thought it was a fish or something at first, like half a rotted fish."
286,"It was bright red, raw."
287,It was a baby.
288,Or a... a fetus or whatever.
289,Could've fit it in the palm of me hand.
290,Tiny. Tiny little thing.
291,Did someone have a miscarriage or something?
292,Yeah. Or something.
293,Yeah. Flushed it.
294,Sick.
295,What'd you do?
296, Ate it!
297, Ah!
298,Pick one for me.
299,What do you got here?
300,Oh. I don't even have to go through them.
301,Here.
302,Got you one.
303,Where do you want it?
304,There.
305, You're so tough.
306, Mmhmm.
307," Oh, I gotta get a hot cloth."
308, I got it. I got it.
309, Gross.
310, Hmm!
311,That's how you does it.
312, That's how all mine were done.
313, Mm!
314,"Hey, you know what I remembered today?"
315,"Me and my buddies, we all had..."
316,"Well, we all used to crush on your mama..."
317,...when we were kids.
318, Really?
319, Yeah. She was beautiful.
320,I guess she was a teenager then.
321,She wore a ponytail on top of her head.
322,I remember I thought it was the coolest thing.
323,She was nice to me too.
324,She was sweet.
325,Let's see.
326,"Patience, now."
327, What is it?
328, You gotta count to six hundred.
329,Hmm.
330,I was hoping you'd pick this one.
331,It suits you.
332,It's your house.
333,It won't be for me.
334, What are you doing here?
335, You're still alive?
336,Check my pulse.
337, Cute tattoo.
338, Thanks.
339,Danny just put it on.
340,I thought you might want your homework.
341,Oh. Sure. Yeah.
342,"You guys are in the beer, are you?"
343,What? I can't come in?
344,Not right now.
345,Just... give me my homework and...
346,I'll come over tomorrow night and we'll hang out.
347,"So you wanna hang out with me now, do you?"
348,How'd you know I was here?
349,Everyone knows you're here with him.
350,Evan said he saw you up in the woods together.
351,Good. I'm glad Evan saw us.
352,You know what people are saying?
353,"You're hookin' up with Evan one day, then you're up  in the woods with him."
354, So you just came over here  to call me a slut.
355," No, I didn't! I came here to check on you because I was worried about you."
356, I can take care of myself.
357, What are you gonna do?
358,"Follow him around, be his little groupie?"
359,Everything all right?
360,You causin' trouble for my girl?
361,That's not gonna fly with me.
362,"Why don't you get a girlfriend your own age, you creep."
363,"Why don't you make yourself scarce, young one?"
364,"We were supposed to go to town on the weekend to look at grad dresses, but I guess you don't care about that anymore."
365,"No, I don't care about that anymore."
366,I don't give a fuck either.
367,Come on.
368,You all right?
369,Yeah. Fuck her anyway.
370,That's the spirit.
371,Tired?
372,I guess.
373,"Well, I'll probably go to bed now soon."
374,OK.
375,Maybe I should... go?
376,'Kay.
377,I'll see you at Lisa's tomorrow night.
378,Yeah.
379,"Yeah, I'm gonna take off then after that."
380,I'm going back to town.
381,I gotta get back to me bar and everything.
382,"Yeah, I don't blame you."
383,One week in this place is enough to make anyone want to leave.
384,There she is.
385,Easy. Go easy now.
386,What?
387,Yeah...
388,"I'd... I'd say that I didn't see anything, but..."
389,"Oh, she's not having any jokes."
390,How are you feeling?
391,Not much really.
392,What can I get you?
393,What do you need?
394,Something to warm me up maybe?
395,Drop of rum with ginger ale.
396, Thanks.
397, Don't tell Lisa.
398,"Shit! Oh, shit!"
399,What time is it?
400, We gotta go to supper!
401, That's done. That's done.
402,We already arsed that up.
403,Oh...
404, Fuck.
405, Don't worry about it.
406,It's just a bit of supper.
407,Lisa'd probably be more surprised if I did show up.
408,"We might as well spend the night here, eh?"
409,I'll bring you over in the morning.
410,I'll come with you.
411, Yeah?
412, Mmhmm.
413,"When you left, how'd you do it?"
414,"I made a mess of it, I suppose."
415,Made an arsehole of myself...
416,"'til by the time I left, there was nobody sad to see me leave."
417,I wouldn't recommend that approach.
418,I don't want you to leave.
419,I've gotten pretty used to your company too.
420,Come here.
421,"If you leave, I'll have nobody."
422,Hmm.
423,I hate them all.
424,All the boys around here and their dirty fucking fingernails.
425,"I swear to God, if one more of them touches me, I'll slit their throat."
426,Hey. That's a bit drastic.
427,"Why don't you just, uh..."
428,"stick it out, finish school..."
429,...hit the road.
430,There's nobody holding you here.
431,OK?
432,"I'm sorry we, uh..."
433,we missed supper.
434,I had it all out.
435,You could've called.
436,What was so important you had to miss supper?
437,"Where the Jesus have you been, Tess?"
438, It's my fault.
439, No doubt about that.
440,I should've known that she was tangled up with the likes of you.
441,What happened?
442,What do you think happened?
443,Look whose clothes  she's wearing!
444, I...
445,brought the girl home.
446,"Danny, you said all this shit was behind us."
447,"Look, just get the Jesus off this deck before I throws you off."
448,OK.
449,You haven't changed one ounce!
450,Not one ounce!
451,I'm sorry they were such assholes.
452,"That's, uh..."
453,"nothing to do with you, girl."
454,You leaving now?
455,"Oh, yeah."
456,I'll say.
457,You gonna be all right?
458,"You look me up, you makes your way to the big city."
459, Yeah?
460, Mmhmm.
461,Come here.
462,What the hell is wrong with you?
463,You wouldn't even let him speak.
464, You don't know him.
465," Yeah, I do. I know him."
466,I know him really well and he knows me too.
467,"No. Oh, you don't know him, Tess!"
468," YES, I DO!"
469, You don't know anything about him! Did you know that he broke his mother's nose once?
470, Did he tell you that one?
471, He was a kid when he did that!
472,Like you are?
473,I'm goin' home.
474,You don't have to leave.
475,You never wanted me here anyway.
476,"âª Something beautiful âª âª Way outside my reach âª âª From some foreign land âª âª To the distance stand âª âª For hungry boys like me âª Hi, Tess."
477,It's Mrs. Power again.
478,"Since you won't call me back, I guess I have to leave it here."
479,You've officially missed too many days to graduate.
480,"But please, come by and talk to me."
481,There's summer school or you could do an extra year.
482,We can figure this out.
483,"Anyway, get in touch."
484,I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. That's all.
485,I couldn't stay.
486,What do you think?
487,It's nice.
488,Not bad. I'll dig out some blankets for you.
489,You can go in.
490,That's my room right there.
491,I'm pretty good at decoratin'.
492,Maybe I could help you put some pictures up or something.
493, You don't like it?
494, Uh...
495," No, I do."
496," Oh, here he is."
497,World's youngest alcoholic.
498,Turn pro at 24.
499,I like to support local business.
500,Oh! You must be here to pay your tab.
501,Can I have something?
502,I got it. What do you want?
503,Uh...
504,What are you drinking?
505,You don't want the shit he drinks.
506,How about a Tom Collins?
507,It's kind of like a lemonade.
508,OK.
509,Tom fuckin' Collins.
510,Yes sir.
511,"He knows how to make that, right?"
512,What's your name?
513,Tess. What's yours?
514,"Nick. Dick, as Danny calls me."
515,You find that funny?
516, What do you do?
517, Not much.
518, Go to university.
519," I'll assume that's on your tab as well, is it, dicky bird?"
520,"Yeah, man."
521,I'll get you on Sunday.
522,Yeah.
523,That's when his allowance comes through.
524,So what are you doing in this dirty old bar  on a Tuesday?
525, I'm staying with Danny.
526,Yeah. She's staying with Danny.
527, She's staying with Danny.
528, Is that  all right with you?
529, I suppose.
530,People end up making these consistent errors in their judgment.
531,"Like, for instance, like this one called the prospector."
532,"Like, the guy is going to offer you a choice between a guaranteed $1000 or maybe a 5050 chance of getting $0 if you took the bet."
533,"Most times, people don't take the guaranteed $1000 just because when it comes to a sure game, people are more riskadverse."
534,"But in the case that, if it was like a..."
535,"like a sure loss, then all of a sudden,  people become a little more..."
536, Where's he going?
537,"Oh, who knows?"
538,You can't keep track of him.
539,Not gonna get rid of me that easy.
540,Hungry?
541,That's disgusting.
542,I thought you liked 'em.
543,You trying to kill us or what?
544, I was gonna do that.
545, No.
546,Where are you goin'?

636,"Ah, that was a mistake, wasn't it?"
637, What was a mistake?
638, What we did.
639,I knew it was a bad idea.
640,It wasn't a bad idea.
641,It was... fun.
642, It was fun.
643, Hmm.
644,Mmhmm.
645,Why can't we fuck every now and again?
646,"""Fuck every now and again."" Simple as that, is it, with you?"

660,Sittin' down over there all by herself.
661, Don't get any strange ideas.
662, No.
663,Hi.
664,What do you think?
665,A gorgeous little thing she is.
666,You can keep her.
667,I've gotta work now.
668,"You want a drink there, runaway?"
669,Give us a Tom Collins.
670,Hmm.
671,I'm gonna jack up the price of them things on you.
672,Here's a five.
673,I can't get a beer in here for $5.
674,"But a tumor, for free."
675,You're so beautiful.
676,Your hair and your outfit and...
677, everything.
678, You are somethin' sweet.
679," Thank you, Tess."
680, What's your life like?
681, What's my life like?
682, Yeah. Like your everyday life.
683, What's it like?
684," Well, I'm a hairdresser."
685,I work at this place called Live or Dye.
686,DYE.
687, Oh.
688, It's so stupid. I know.
689,"But, um, I'm thinkin' I'd like to have my own spot soon."
690, My mom was a hairdresser.
691, Really?
692, Yeah.
693, Cool.
694,"Well, like, kind of, 'cause..."
695,she would cut people's hair in the kitchen sometimes.
696, In your kitchen?
697, Yeah.
698,"Must've got a lot of hair in your food, did you?"
699,What's it like being a hairdresser?
700,"Well, I mean, I'm on my feet all day in heels, so it's really hard."
701,"But sometimes, it is so fucking powerful."
702,"You know, when I get a guy in my chair, and I'm standing in front of him, you know, I'm checking the sides to make sure they're even, well, I make sure to bend over real far so that his face is right in my tits."
703,"Huge tip. I mean, huge."
704,I think he feels like he just fucked me or something.
705,It's funny.
706, Do you like it?
707, Being a hairdresser?
708,"No, your life."
709,You know what?
710,Yeah. I guess I do.
711,Yep.
712,âª Ooh âª Fuckin' skeets.
713,"âª Nononono âª âª Ohohohoh âª âª Oohoohoohooh âª âª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah âª âª Oohoohoohoohooh âª âª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah âª âª Nononooh âª âª Nonononononono âª âª Mm âª âª Mmmmmm âª âª Lada âª But I was just some fuckin' glum, motley..."
714,I can't... I can't believe this is where I washed up...
715,at this hour.
716,Did this fellow here ever  tell you how we met?
717, No.
718," Go on, tell her."
719," Danny, fuck off."
720,"Oh, it's a good story."
721,"It's a fuckin' story  to tell, dude."
722, Stop it.
723,"What? I'll tell it then, Jesus Christ,  'cause it's my story too."
724," Danny, I'm..."
725, serious.
726, I wanna hear it. Go.
727,It was just after getting this place.
728,Um... it was about three years ago.
729,"Five o'clock in the morning, just after shuttin' her down for the night or the morning, wouldn't you say?"
730,I was goin' along the waterfront down there.
731,"It was a fine, beautiful day."
732,"Sun just breakin' in, shootin' arrows."
733,I hears this sound...
734,it was like a dying seal.
735,"I come along, here's your man there with his legs slung out over the wharf, starin' down into the bubble."
736,Rocks in his pocket.
737,And he had a...
738,"note next to him, folded up there."
739,Big rock on top of that.
740,Tell them what the note said.
741,"Dude, tell them what the note said!"
742,"It said, ""I just want..."
743,"""All I want is to sleep."
744,"To sleep endlessly in the ocean deep."" Fuckin' cracked!"
745,He wrote that himself.
746,I have it here somewhere.
747,I have it here put away somewhere.
748,"And I had to fuckin' lug him out over me shoulder and cart him up, body and bones, up to the mental then."
749,"Danny? You're a real fuckin' prick, you know that?"
750,"Yes, ma. It's just a story!"
751, What?
752, Fuck!
753," Yes, me smokes, now mined out!"
754, Let's go get some air.
755,HEY! Where you goin'?
756,"Dicky bird, I'm sorry."
757,I'm sorry.
758,Yeah. Sensitive bunch.
759,Me and you.
760, Get me a beer?
761, Oh.
762,What you gonna do for me?
763, What?
764, What?
765,You tell me.
766,"You're like a youngster, you know that?"
767,What's wrong with that?
768,"You should give me one of them, uh, kisses that you likes to give."
769,âª Gray skies âª âª Long on the lonely nights âª âª Whole world can pass on by âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª âª Until I find you âª I got you some chips and gravy and one of them sprinkly donuts.
770,I knows you loves them.
771,Your mother'd never leave town without picking up a box of them for you.
772,I'm not hungry.
773,"Well, you gotta eat, girl."
774,I said I'm not hungry.
775,You don't look good.
776,"Oh, thanks."
777,"I mean it, you don't."
778,You look sick.
779,"What kind of dirt has he got you into, hey?"
780,"You're not on drugs, are you?"
781,No! God!
782,You should see a doctor.
783,How are you doin'?
784,How's home?
785,Fine. Fine. Everything's fine.
786,The same.
787,Tracy dropped by looking for you.
788,Was all upset that you left.
789,You had your graduation and you left.
790,They had a limo takin' 'em all around the harbour.
791, They did?
792," Yeah, with the big..."
793,limo bus thingies.
794,About 20 of 'em.
795,Cold enough to skin you.
796,"They were down on the beach, gettin' their pictures done."
797,Big ol' fluffy dresses blowin' in the wind.
798,That sounds nice.
799,You fucked up your school.
800,What are you gonna do now?
801,Not much you can do without your school.
802,You got gravy on your chin.
803, We're together.
804, I don't wanna hear about that.
805,We are together. I moved in.
806,I'm workin' at his bar.
807,Good for you.
808,"He is a good person, you know."
809,He cares about me and he...
810,Jesus!
811,I said I don't wanna hear about him.
812,And he loves me.
813, Is that right?
814, Yeah.
815,It is. He loves me.
816,I just dropped by to see how you were makin' out.
817,I'm wicked. Thanks.
818,Your house is still there.
819,I don't want it.
820,"âª She followed a feeling âª âª To a highandmighty place âª âª One where all your gravity âª âª Becomes a passing grace âª âª One that lures you with the promise âª âª Of an overarching answer âª âª One where beauty takes the hand âª âª Of every lonely dancer âª âª It wasn't long before she knew âª âª She was travelling the wrong direction âª âª Following the world's applause âª âª For deeds of selfdeception âª âª Sealing off her senses âª âª To light and warmth and praise âª âª Trying to pour a damning water âª âª Over the gracious flame âª âª Misery's faint glimmer âª âª In the darkest of minds âª âª As an ember glows in ashes âª âª While the sun decides to rise âª âª Or a voice appears, the one you hear âª âª Of the unknown soldier who you left behind âª âª Calling out âª âª from where you left âª âª The dayold ashes âª âª Still trying to warm âª âª Your mind âª  What do you think?"
821, Wow.
822,You look so good.
823,"God, I do, don't I?"
824,"So listen, what happened with you and Nick after?"
825, Me and Nick?
826, Yeah.
827,Danny and I figured the two of you were gonna hook up.
828,Did Danny say that?
829,"Oh, you've got a crush on him, don't you?"
830,"No. No, I just..."
831,like hangin' out with him when I'm at the bar.
832,I mean Danny.
833, Oh.
834," You know he makes everyone feel like he's their best friend, right? Tells you all his secrets so you get really close to him."
835,"But then one day, I realized he doesn't give a fuck."
836,He says that shit to everyone he meets.
837,We are close.
838,I'm just saying Danny does whatever he wants with whoever he wants.
839,"Anyway, he's gonna have to sell the bar 'cause his mother wouldn't give him any money."
840,Fuck. This dress is awful.
841,Here. You try on this purple one.
842,No way. It's not gonna fit me.
843,Yes it will. You're not big!
844," No, it's way too small."
845," Christ, you're some stubborn!"
846,Go try it on!
847,We're having a baby.
848, What did you say?
849, Me and Danny.
850, You're pregnant?
851, Yeah.
852,And he wants to.
853,So he knows?
854,"No, I haven't told him yet, but I do know that he wants to."
855,"Well, if I were you, I'd tell him right away."
856,Agh!
857,Where you goin'?
858,I'm goin' to meet a man about a horse.
859, Why?
860, Will you be back later?
861,Have a good day then.
862,Yeah?
863, Can I come in?
864, Mm.
865,What are you watchin'?
866,I don't know. Fuck all.
867,Are you all right?
868,I haven't been feeling well.
869,Sit down if you like.
870,Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
871,No.
872,I don't think so.
873,How come you let her sleep in your bed but I can't?
874,You have your own room.
875,I just wanna be close to you all the time.
876, I'm in love with you.
877, Ah. Here.
878,Get off me.
879,Give me some fuckin' room.
880,Stop saying shit like that.
881," I am, though."
882, You're not.
883, I love you.
884," No, you don't."
885,You don't know me.
886,"Yes, I do."
887,And you know me.
888,And you love me.
889,I don't.
890,I know you love me.
891,You came to get me.
892,No. Listen.
893,You left on your own.
894,Get off me!
895,All right.
896,You needed a place to stay.
897,I gave you a place to stay.
898,"That's how this whole thing went down, all right?"
899,That's what it is.
900,There's no more to it than that.
901,Get up. Come on. It's OK.
902,It's not...
903,Just come on. Come up.
904,Here you go. It's OK.
905," All right, come on. Oh, no, no."
906, Come on.
907," No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
908," Please, please, please, please."
909,"I can't, uh, I can't have this going on."
910,I got enough goin' on.
911,What am I supposed to do now?
912,I don't...
913,We're gonna have a baby.
914," Who's ""we""?"
915, Me.
916,You and me.
917,I'm pregnant.
918,"I, uh... I don't wanna hear anything like that."
919,Like what? Are you just trying to rope me into being your boyfriend or something?
920, 'Cause it's not gonna work.
921, No! NO!
922, I'm not roping you in.
923, I don't know what you got goin' on in your head up there but it's not gonna happen.
924,Why don't you believe me?
925,Calm down.
926,"If you leave, I'm gonna kill myself."
927,"Yeah, I am."
928,I'm gonna kill myself just like my mom did.
929,OK. That's your solution?
930,That's your answer to everything?
931,"Toss yourself into the harbour, is that how you're gonna do it?"
932,"Tess, you need some help, girl."
933,And it ain't me. Can't let you come crawlin' into my bed.
934,I know it seems like a lot of people.
935,"But I swear, we're not just here to hang out. OK?"
936,"Tess, I'm Dr. Summers."
937,I'll be doing your procedure.
938, How you doing? You OK?
939, Mmhmm.
940, OK.
941," Now, Tess?"
942,Just take this for me.
943,"This is nitrous oxide, laughing gas."
944,"Now, all right, nice and tight."
945,OK. Deep breaths.
946,It's gonna make you feel like you're swimming.
947,"That's good, Tess. Just give us a few of those deep, deep breaths."
948,Thank you.
949, Good girl.
950," Now, relax for me. Knees apart. Thank you."
951, How are you feeling?
952, Mmhmm.
953, OK?
954," Bit of pressure, Tess."
955,There's gonna be a bit of a pinch now. OK?
956,There you go.
957,All right.
958,Yup. Thank you.
959,I slept like a friggin' pretzel last night.
960,I woke up this morning and my arm was all in knots.
961,"I swear, I had to do yoga  just to get out of bed."
962," Oh, that must be nice."
963,I never slept at all. Jaden went and wet the bed again.
964," Oh, God."
965," Oh, yeah. And then crawled in  with me."
966, Just be glad.
967,"I mean, mine won't even give me a hug anymore."
968,Friggin' teenagers.
969,...stop putting fish in the friggin' micro...
970,"âª In the white, I wake up âª âª In the white, I die âª âª And somewhere in the red âª âª I see your eyes âª âª And in the green, I'm out walking âª âª And in the green, I live âª I'm sorry, little fish."
971,I'm gonna have myself instead.
972,âª And somewhere in the red âª  âª I have your lips âª  OK. How are you feeling? Hmm?
973, How are we feeling?
974, You're so funny.
975,You should be a standup comedian.
976,"Uhhuh, that's just because you're stoned."
977,OK?
978,"Oh! Oh, no! Hang on!"
979,Hang on! Slow down. The speculum is still in there.
980,The doctor's just going through the period goop  to make sure they got it. OK?
981, We got it all.
982,"You are not pregnant anymore, Tess."
983,"Well, there you go!"
984,Not pregnant anymore.
985,You can put your legs down now.
986,You take it easy.
987,Just over on this side here.
988,Easy.
989,All right.
990,We'll put these on for you.
991,Here we go.
992,All right. Steady on your feet there now.
993,OK. You take your time getting ready.
994,"Call out and let me know when you're done, OK?"
995,Mmhmm.
996,"Thanks for the lift, Nick."
997,"You know, they probably tell you not to drive after for a reason."
998,You sure you're OK?
999,Yeah.
1000,"Really, I... I'm fine."
1001,I promise.
1002,All right.
1003,Don't tell anyone?
1004,Won't open my mouth about it.
1005,"You're very best kind, Nick."
1006,Let me know when you're coming back to town.
