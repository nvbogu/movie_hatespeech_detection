0,"There's a man out there named 'Shit', calling for us to stop."
1,These are barren mountains.
2,We don't know what kind of person he is.
3,How can we stop?
4,"If we don't stop, he could die of thirst."
5,"Seven, tell them to stop the carriage."
6,"Master, I've been eating beans and suffering diarrhea every day."
7,"If I don't have rice soon, I'll starve to death quick."
8,Hey! Stop the carriage!
9,Hey!
10,"FaHung, they can't hear you shouting."
11,Hey!
12,What are you doing?
13,Climbing!
14,Stop.
15,Turn back to pick up that man.
16,Is there anything happier than saving a life?
17,Save your own life!
18,Yes. This is a good opportunity to practise more of your English.
19,Go on.
20,You know how?
21,I know everything!
22,Did you understand what he said?
23,No.
24,I only pretended I understood.
25,Still saying 'yeah'?
26,You eat this one.
27,"Master, it's beans again."
28,I think it's going to be hard for me to visit So.
29,The clinic that So opened here is also called Po Chi Lam.
30,Yes.
31,Po Chi Lam.
32,Such a joke of him to make us come this far to visit a Western Po Chi Lam.
33,"Master, we don't need to eat beans anymore!"
34,Hey!
35,Where are you going?
36,"Master, would you like to eat chicken ass?"
37,How do I drink you?
38,Here.
39,You...
40,You don't have any sense of humour!
41,"After that, don't say I have no sense of humour!"
42,Be careful! Stay away!
43,'Shadowless Kick'!
44," Master, there are many barbarians!"
45, Protect 13th Aunt!
46,I know how to take care of myself.
47,FeiHung!
48,Seven!
49,The carriage is out of control!
50,Give me a ride!
51, 13th Aunt! I'll save you!
52, Seven!
53,It's very dangerous!
54,Sit back inside!
55,Don't touch my carriage!
56, Where's your master? FeiHung!
57, I can't hear you! Watch out!
58,One foot. Two feet.
59,No need for you!
60,Get out!
61,Sit down.
62,Be careful!
63,Let's go.
64,Let's go.
65,PO CHI LAM Don't overreact.
66,The beer in this town isn't good to drink.
67,Sit down and let me see it.
68, Have a look at it first. Look at it.
69, It's okay.
70,Sit down.
71,There.
72,Hold on.
73,"Dr So, help!"
74,"Dr So, where are you?"
75,Dr 50!
76,Quick!
77, How are they?
78," Hey, what has happened?"
79,"Dr So, we rescued them from the Gold Sand river."
80,"They woke for a short while, but lost consciousness again."
81,Seven!
82, Ying!
83," Yes, Master?"
84, You massage his chest for me.
85, Okay.
86,I taught you before.
87,Doctor! Doctor!
88,I'll massage her for you!
89,Stop fighting!
90,Why fight?
91,We'll take turns!
92, I'll go first!
93, No!
94,She's...
95,"She's my master's fiancÃ©, how can you massage her?"
96,Hey!
97,Look at this foreigner.
98,More ruthless than I am!
99,"Don't be noisy, don't..."
100, She's awake now!
101, Seven.
102,I'm hungry.
103, Seven!
104, FeiHung!
105,I have a new son!
106,This weave is excellent.
107,We should learn how to do it.
108,Father!
109,The great spirit has blessed me with another son!
110,Where is this?
111,How can you be so rude to a lady?
112,"This means 'What is your name?' Master, I've been eating beans and suffering diarrhea every day."
113,"If I don't have rice soon, I'll starve to death quick."
114,Sorry.
115,Master Wong!
116,Master's umbrella?
117,Look!
118,This is Master's umbrella!
119,let's search again after lunch.
120, You go ahead and eat.
121, Okay.
122,Damned foreigner.
123,We can't even search for someone?
124,They never treat us Chinese miners like human beings. We're accustomed to it.
125,And they always bully us.
126,He's the only one here.
127,Let's get rid of him.
128,Don't talk too loud!
129,This policeman is good to us Chinese.
130,Don't you remember?
131,There was a few times he drove away the foreign bullies for us.
132,Let's go.
133,Hey!
134,What are you doing?
135,"Don't touch her again, or I won't be so civil!"
136,Damn 'what'!
137,'Damn what'.
138,it's raining hard.
139,Go back inside.
140,No. I'm afraid in case FeiHung won't find us when he's back.
141,"If you fell ill, Master wouldn't be happy."
142,"Yes. 13th Aunt, please go back inside."
143,FeiHung!
144,SiuKwan!
145, Master!
146, Seven! Seven!
147,SiuKwan!
148,"Hey, step aside."
149," Hey, what are you all looking at?"
150, A woman!
151,What's so good about a woman?
152,"You're old, and still looking?"
153,"I can't do anything, but I can always look."
154,Go on.
155,We're closed today!
156,Go.
157, 13th Aunt.
158," Seven, help me test if it's sticky enough."
159,Should some water be added?
160,"So, what are you eating?"
161,This is glue.
162,It's enough.
163, Is it sticky?
164, Sticky!
165,"You say it was 'good.' I didn't say anything, I was only nodding."
166,Both of you help me stick these on the street.
167,"Hey, you carry the glue."
168,Post one here.
169,Post one here too.
170,Why did they tear our...
171, What did he say?
172, It's okay.
173,Never mind.
174,Let's go.
175,Your agility is pretty good.
176,What?
177,You want to train your leg?
178,If you're not afraid of the hardship...
179,Like this.
180,Press your legs every day for four hours.
181,That's it.
182, 13th Aunt!
183, 13th Aunt.
184,I'm not convinced.
185," Seven, teach them a lesson."
186, Right!
187,No! I'll take advantage of Master's absence.
188,I want to fight more!
189,"So, translate!"
190,Tell them to fight me all at once.
191,"If they beat me, they win."
192," Seven, he said..."
193, Trust me!
194,How can I be in the mood to enjoy this landscape?
195,Why don't you bring me back to the place you found me?
196,Maybe I'll remember where I came from.
197,But you don't know what I'm talking about.
198,"Clothes, it would be great if you could speak; you could tell me who I am."
199,'Master'...
200,...'America'...
201,...'opening Po Chi Lam'...
202,...'first anniversary'...
203,...'talkative'...
204,"Was this letter written to others, or did someone write to me?"
205,Could it be that I'm called talkative?
206,'Master'?
207,I have a master.
208,"If I find him, I'll understand."
209,'Wong Fei'?
210,I must have known him.
211,"If I find him, I'll know who I am."
212,What can I do for you?
213,I want to marry your daughter!
214,Fierce Eagle!
215,Fierce Eagle!
216,Hey...
217,Hey...
218,Hey...
219,Come on!
220,Let me try.
221,I really envy you.
222,You at least know your home.
223,I don't know where mine is.
224,You don't understand what I'm saying.
225,That's okay.
226,At least you're very happy.
227,Unlike me.
228,I think the whole day about where to go back.
229,Thank you.
230,"As of now, verbal communication isn't necessary."
231,I pat you; you pat me Okay? .
232,"I try to forget, but it keeps returning."
233,Really annoying.
234,Forget it!
235,You like it?
236,Take it.
237,"FeiHung, have a smoke."
238,This is bad.
239," No, it's not a mental problem."
240, What is it then?
241,that make her miss Master.
242,Seeing objects that make her miss Master?
243,"I've told you before, smoking's bad for your health."
244,But it doesn't matter now.
245,FeiHung?
246,A woman?
247,FeiHung!
248,FeiHung?
249,Who's FeiHung?
250,You are.
251,I'm FeiHung?
252,Then who are you?
253,I'm SiuKwan  13th Aunt.
254,Your fiancÃ©!
255,"If you're my aunt, how can you be my fiancÃ© too?"
256, Your name is Yellow?
257, Everyone here calls me Yellow.
258,How can you just grab something?
259,For you.
260,She cares about the ring.
261,Why doesn't she want it?
262,Your body function is weak.
263, I'm weak?
264, Yes.
265,And I have to be assessed under the sun?
266,No.
267,She is turning upside down.
268,Now everyone in Po Chi Lam is avoiding her.
269,You thought Master is ferocious?
270,"When women turn that way, they're even worse."
271,We haven't seen women for a long time.
272,How is it when she gets ferocious?
273,"So, So!"
274, What's the fuss this time?
275, She's packing luggage.
276," 13th Aunt, where are you going?"
277, Back to Tangshan.
278, Tangshan?
279, What?
280,"Prepare a carriage for me, I want to going back to Tangshan."
281,"Seven, prepare the carriage."
282,What's up?
283,mental problems again.
284,"You take her for a walk around the laundry, then tell her she's already in Tangshan."
285,"Go, my ass!"
286,You really think I have a mental problem?
287,I know how to get back to Tangshan.
288,"Take a tenday trip to San Francisco by carriage, then onto a ship for half a year, crossing the Pacific Ocean to Hong Kong."
289,"After that, take the threeday train to Guangzhou, then transfer to Foshan."
290,Anyway... I need to go back!
291,Prepare the carriage for me.
292,Okay.
293,Seven!
294,I'm going back to get it.
295,"So, carry this."
296, 13th Aunt...
297, 13th Aunt...
298, May I ask...
299, I'm not listening to your explanation!
300,"I'm not here to explain anything, I want..."
301,I don't want to hear it!
302,Do you know someone called Talkative?
303,A talkative person?
304,Then you must know Wong Fei?
305,I'm going to ask this woman.
306, How could Master test us like this?
307," No, it's not that."
308,Master... has memory loss!
309,Don't come over here!
310,I won't be so civil.
311, Are you 13th Aunt?
312, I'm not!
313, Do you know Wong Fei then?
314, Damn Wong Fei.
315,I'm not fighting anymore!
316,"Don't think because you're a woman, that you can be reckless."
317, What are you doing?
318, I want to check your pulse.
319,he has memory loss.
320,Memory loss can be...
321,Memory loss?
322,What should we do?
323,"Right, let me try something."
324,What are you doing?
325,I want to show you Wong FeiHung's unique move: 'Shadowless Kick of Foshan'.
326, Who's Wong FeiHung?
327," It's you, of course!"
328,You're one of the Ten Tigers of Guangdong.
329,Coach of the local militia.
330,"You live at 8 South City Street, Foshan."
331,An expert in cut wounds and bone setting.
332,A provider of free treatment.
333,"Promoter of the spirit of Kung Fu, open to challenge, and tough on outlaws."
334,"The second generation of Po Chi Lam, Wong FeiHung!"
335,What are the Ten Tigers of Guangdong?
336,Coaching the local militia?
337,"I live in 8 South City Street, Foshan?"
338,An expert in cut wounds and bone setting?
339,A provider of free treatment?
340,"Promoter of the spirit of Kung Fu, open to challenge, and tough on outlaws?"
341,"The second generation of Po Chi Lam, Wong FeiHung?"
342,That's Wong FeiHung?
343,Can't you see we both have the same posture?
344,"Seven, he doesn't know who he is."
345,What's the use in that?
346,Are you okay?
347," So, are you okay?"
348, I'm okay.
349,Think quickly how to help him regain his memory!
350, You...
351," Wong FeiHung, I, Yan Zhendong, want to challenge you today."
352,I am Iron Shirt Yan Zhendong.
353,I'm not afraid of you!
354,Come on!
355,Come on!
356,A little thicker.
357,"Wong FeiHung, Iron Cloth is attacked at the stomach, not the face!"
358,"Wong FeiHung, do you remember Commander NaIan?"
359,Commander NaIan!
360,Commander NaIan!
361,Stop messing around.
362,Seven!
363,Come with me!
364,Come.
365,"Master, why are you fighting more and more vigorously?"
366,Seven!
367,Stop fighting with him!
368,Seven!
369,Stop fighting!
370, FeiHung!
371, SiuKwan!
372," SiuKwan, are you okay?"
373, I'm okay.
374,Seven!Seven!
375,I'm... okay.
376,"Seven, how badly did you fall?"
377,It wasn't from falling.
378,"Master, you hit me."
379,Seven! Great!
380,Master's back!
381,I know.
382,It's okay.
383,This trip to America is really like a dream.
384,You mean a dream with a foreign lover.
385,I guess the dream was worth it.
386,What lover?
387,That's a question for you.
388,Here.
389,Didn't I just wipe myself?
390,You can give a ring twice but not wipe your face again?
391,"Okay, okay."
392,But I have no memory of anything you've told me.
393,I don't understand what you're talking about.
394,Do you think about that woman?
395,I don't think about women.
396,I don't have the time.
397,Do you miss her?
398,Yes.
399,Didn't you just say you haven't thought of that woman?
400,Thinking and missing are two different things.
401,How can that be?
402,It's the truth.
403,"The truth is, I don't want to talk to you."
404,You're the one I miss.
405,You know how reserved I am.
406,It's something I'd never directly say.
407, Master Wong.
408, Hello.
409,Master Wong is here!
410,"Uncle Long, Master Wong is here!"
411,"Master Wong is here, so what?"
412,Master Wong doesn't like people gambling.
413,We can pack up early and gamble again later.
414,No way! How can you do that?
415,"I bet on one, and one is up!"
416, Hey! Hurry up!
417, Master Wong is really coming!
418,"Hey, did you win the money?"
419,How big is the bet?
420, I'll play too! Let's play together!
421, A little.
422,Come on!
423, What is Master doing?
424," Hey, let's play together!"
425," Master Wong, you're in?"
426, I'm in!
427,"Come on, let me be the dealer, okay?"
428,Come on.
429,Let's have some larger bets!
430,Come on.
431, Really?
432, Sure!
433,"Hey, the more, the better!"
434, Let's bet. Master Wong asks us to.
435, Let's bet.
436," Master, he..."
437, Bet!
438,Bets can't be withdrawn!
439,"Anyway, everyone has so much money and nowhere to use it."
440,Why don't you bet it all?
441,Hey.
442,"Master Wong, you are our hope."
443,"If you do this too, we'll have no more inspiration."
444,"I'm not used to this. Master Wong, can you return to your former self?"
445,We're not gambling... today.
446,Understood.
447,Everyone...
448,I actually came here today to thank you all for your caring.
449,I have a few words I want to say.
450,Everyone has come along way through the seas to this unusual place.
451,The opening of Po Chi Lam is for...
452,...someone once said...
453,"...everyone needs to know how to get along with others, and especially to understand who you are."
454,I don't wish for Po Chi Lam to become prosperous...
455,...I hope Po Chi Lam can carry out the consistent spirit...
456,...to get stronger and healthier...
457,...and shine for the Chinese race!
458,"Simply put, everyone remember who they are."
459,I'll say this much for today.
460,Thank you everyone for listening.
461,Get up!
462,"Master Wong, what you said just now was indeed brilliant!"
463,You're welcome.
464, Let's go.
465," Uncle, take the money."
466,It's not easy to earn.
467,"Master Wong, no more speeches please."
468,Thank you.
469,"Hey, it's okay!"
470,Master Wong isn't coming!
471,Let's go.
472, Well?
473, He's too busy. Come on.
474,I'll be the dealer.
475,Bet.
476,It's payday!
477,"Hey, Uncle Han, what does this man do?"
478,He's our foreman; always takes a share of our pay.
479,"You can kick fast, so what?"
480,Don't forget that this is a world of guns.
481,Can your kicking be faster than bullets?
482, Master Wong!
483, How is everyone? How are you?
484," Master Wong, 3 new signboard?"
485, Yes.
486,"Everyone, I have something to say today."
487,"Master Wong, you have something to say again?"
488,There's no need! It's better showing us a demonstration of Cross Fist.
489, Show us! Come on.
490, There'll be an opportunity.
491,"Today, it is the first anniversary of the American Po Chi Lam."
492,"Firstly, I'd like to thank you all for taking care of my student, So."
493,"Don't mention it, we're all Chinese."
494,"We should help each other, right?"
495,"Everyone, you've come a long way through the seas to an unusual place."
496,You should watch out for and help each other.
497,Po Chi Lam was established in the hope that this could be achieved.
498,But I don't wish for the business to be prosperous.
499,"If the case, it would mean everyone is suffering."
500,That is not what I want.
501,I hope that the American Po Chi Lam will become the back garden for everyone living overseas.
502,"When there is time, people can sit, have tea, chat, practise Kung Fu, refresh, maintain physical health."
503,I really hope to maintain the consistent spirit of Po Chi Lam.
504,"We'll strive together, learn the positives of the foreigners and take that home, and shine for the Chinese race!"
505,That's all.
506,Please come in everyone for snacks!
507,"Master, should there not have been some applause?"
508,Perhaps it was 13th Aunt coming out...
509,and the timing wasn't right.
510,Timing.
511,Yes.
512,Yes.
513,"Quiet, everyone!"
514,They're saying we were involved in a bank robbery.
515,They want to search here now.
516,Fine.
517,Innocence proves anything.
518,Everyone give way.
519,Do not trouble the police.
520,Let them search!
521,"Master Wong, don't be reckless!"
522,Life matters most!
523,Yes!
524,"Master Wong, don't!"
525,...appreciate you too!
526,He said he would get the best conditions for us...
527,"...so long as we hand over seven people to plead guilty, the rest will be okay."
528,Uncle Long is right.
529,This is indeed a matter for Po Chi Lam.
530,Nothing to do with anyone else.
531,"So, ask the sheriff, can I take responsibility alone?"
532,No!
533,"Master, don't say you'll take responsibility alone!"
534,"Even if you are first, I'll be second to confess!"
535, So!
536, Master!
537,My name is Seven.
538,"I'll not be the third, I'll be seventh!"
539,FeiHung.
540,None of you go.
541,Let me confess.
542,This is clearly a miscarriage of justice.
543,"Master Wong, you are young and promising; the leader of our generation."
544,Your life should be spared for the good of Chinese workers.
545,You have nothing to do with Po Chi Lam.
546,Don't get yourself involved!
547,"Uncle, our story shouldn't be the struggles of overseas Chinese but the glory of Chinese workers."
548,"I, Wong FeiHung, must stand out!"
549,Who disagrees?
550,Come here!
551,FeiHung.
552,It's all my fault.
553,I couldn't have imagined that coming to America a year ago to establish the branch of Po Chi Lam would actually pave the way for this catastrophe.
554,Also that I involved my master.
555,"Uncle Han, are you afraid?"
556,"Getting married, having a newborn child, worked hard to earn money, acted like an emperor at home, yet struggled outside."
557,That was my life.
558,"Master Wong, this is all I can do."
559,"Master Wong, there's 'stuffing'."
560,Eat it.
561,"Master, it's all over to you."
562,"Master, I have full confidence in you."
563,"Hey, one more!"
564,There's other people too.
565,"Why is it that, when we were arrested, you weren't there?"
566,I didn't do anything.
567,I didn't do anything wrong.
568,Move away!
569,"Master, he was the one who robbed the bank."
570,"I have to catch him, to prove my innocence."
571,"So, save the others first."
572,"Master, let me have these two!"
573,For you!
574,Go in!
575,Go! Go!
576,Go!
