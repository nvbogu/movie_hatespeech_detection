23,I made her laugh.
24,"Well, thank you for your honesty."
25,    Stay away from my daughter.
26,How'd you get out?
27,The window.

55,"Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum."
56,"Uh, if I may, sir, I believe I have skills and ideas that go well beyond punching numbers into an adding machine."
57,"Well, I've read about this German fellow, Lilienthal, I believe, who's developed a glider that can take a man in the air, sir."
58,Isn't that amazing?
59,"I mean, if you were to apply that to this business,  it would be revolutionary."
60, Gentlemen!
61,Can I have your attention?
62,You're all dismissed.
63,Bankrupt?
64,I thought the company had a dozen trading ships.
65,"Yes, at the bottom of the South China Sea."
66,Typhoon sank 'em all.

75,That's what makes our life together so exciting.
76,Charity.
77,This isn't the life I promised you.
78,But I have everything I want.
79,What about the magic?
80,What do you call those two girls?
81,"Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral."
82,Daddy!
83, PHINEAS: Come here!
84, Did you bring a present?
85, A present for what?
86,   For my birthday!
87, Your what?
88, My birthday.
89, It's not your birthday.
90,"Okay, I do have a present..."
91,"but not just any present. Oh, no."
92,The most amazing birthday present ever.
93,"This extraordinary machine was originally created by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago."
94,"But the blueprints had been lost for centuries until just last week, on a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket."
95,They found skeletons and treasures and the blueprints were recovered by none other than J.W. Mercantile.
96,The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly but I managed to commit them to memory.
97,And if I have remembered correctly...
98,"Happy birthday, Caroline."
99,This is a wishing machine.
100,You tell it your wishes...
101,and it keeps them safe until they come true.
102,"Even if you forget them, they're always there."
103,Can I tell a wish?
104,Step right up. Go ahead.
105,I wish to marry Santa Claus.
106, That is a good wish.
107,I wish...
108,for ballet slippers.
109,"Hey, that's... that's a good wish, too."
110,"What's your wish, Mommy?"
111,I wish...
112,for happiness like this forever for you and you...

119, Huh?
120,This bank only wants to lend money to people with money.
121,"What are you looking at, flopdoodle?"
122,Mr. Barnum.
123,This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre.
124,"It's a good bet is what it is, sir."
125,People don't want to admit it...
126,but they're fascinated with the exotic and the macabre.
127,It's why we stare at it.
128,The bank is going to need substantial collateral.
129,"Of course. I, uh..."
130,I wouldn't suggest otherwise.
131,The deed and title to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.
132,"CHARITY: Why would a bank loan us $10,000?"
133,Because we put up collateral.
134,"But, dear, we don't have any collateral."
135,Sure we do. In the South China Seas.
136,CHARITY: In the South China Seas?
137,Deep in the South China Seas.  CHARITY: And what did we buy with this loan?
138,"""Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities."" What kind of museum is it?"
139,A place to be transported.
140,A place where people can see things they've never seen before.
141,Huh?
142, Wax figures?
143, Yeah. Yeah.
144,They're all the rage in Europe. Look.
145,Marie Antoinette with the sore throat. Napoleon.
146,Come here. See?
147,You've already met some of the most famous folks in history.
148,But they're not all wax.
149,This is the great... O'Malley.
150,Master of sleight of hand.
151,A king of deception.
152,You don't look like a magician.
153,I'm a thief.
154,A very good thief.
155,I caught him nicking my watch.
156,     See?
157, An elephant!
158,PHINEAS: Not just any elephant.
159,I can get you somethin' real nice.
160,Just say the word.
161,CHARITY: Oh. Thank you.
162,"Oh, yeah. This is a tenton bull straight from the plains of Africa."
163, And look at that.
164,  The tallest giraffe in the world.
165,CAROLINE: Can I climb up its leg?
166, Absolutely not. Okay.
167,  Now... I know how it looks.
168,"If you didn't, I'd be worried."
169,"I mean, it just needs a little work, but..."
170,The loan has to be paid back every month.
171,"Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it."
172,We just need customers.
173, Hundreds of them.
174, We're gonna get them.
175,Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
176,"It is one hour of your time, sir, but it will change your life."
177, We have shows on the hour every hour.

187, Three.
188, Three.
189,CAROLINE: Daddy.
190,Daddy.
191,Did you sell any more tickets today?
192,A few. Yeah.
193,"Most everyone was rushing home, it's Friday, but..."
194,we sold a few.
195,"I think you have too many dead things in your museum, Daddy."
196,Do you?
197,She's right. You need something alive.
198,"Go to sleep, both of you."
199,Something sensational.
200,That's a big word.
201,It's your word.
202,Something that isn't stuffed.
203, Like a mermaid.
204, Or a unicorn.
205,CAROLINE: Unicorns aren't real.
206,"HELEN: Well, mermaids aren't real either."
207,You must be Gertrude Stratton.
208,I'm looking for your son.

212,GERTRUDE: Charles!
213,Charles!
214,"P.T. Barnum, at your service."
215,I am putting together a show and I need a star.
216,You want people to laugh at me.
217,"Well, they're laughing anyway, kid, so might as well get paid."
218,"I see a soldier, no, a general riding across the stage with a sword and a gun, and... and..."
219,And the most beautiful uniform ever made.
220,"People will come from all over the world, and when they see him, they won't laugh."
221,They'll salute.
222,"âª âª How's it looking, girls?"
223,MAN: Hey! You looking for freaks?
224,I know where you can find one of them.

250, Is this over... your...
251, Entire body.
252,Terrific. I don't need to see it.
253, Now.  Yes!
254,  Can I just ask how heavy you are?
255,Do you have a number for that?
256," I prefer not to say, but..."
257, Just between you and me.

354,"You pay good money to watch people stand around and talk for two hours, and they call me a con man."
355,"Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that?"
356,Ew. Something does smell.
357,"Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts."
358,I can see it right now.
359,"""Youngest prima ballerina in the history of the City Ballet."" I'm quitting."
360,What? Why would you quit?
361,I started too late. I'll never catch up.
362,"Caroline, you were the best dancer on that stage."
363,What? You think I can't spot talent?
364,Ballet takes years of hard work.
365,It's not like the circus.
366,You can't just fake it.
367,She can't quit. No.
368,"No, I mean, she just..."
369,She just feels out of place with the other girls.
370,"Well, I should certainly hope so."
371,I've never seen so many little prima Donnas in my life.
372,"Yeah, but those prima Donnas are the most important thing in the world to her right now."
373,She'll learn to ignore them just like I did.
374,She shouldn't have to.
375,New York society will never accept us.
376,"If they did, they'd have to stop judging and actually do something with their lives."
377,This isn't about me.
378,Oh.
379,So it's different than everything else then?
380,"I just want her to be proud of who she is, of her family."
381,She is proud.
382,We don't have to be the Carlyles.
383,Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?
384,"Yes, I did indeed."
385,Refunds are available at the front box office.
386, P.T. Barnum.
387,From the circus?
388,Yes. You... you've been?
389," God, no."
390,But I have seen the crowds.
391,"People leave your shows a great deal happier than when they came in, which is much more than I can say for my play."
392,"And yet, you have no trouble selling tickets."
393,That's because I'm selling virtue.
394,Can I buy you a drink?
395,I wanna go after the carriage trade.
396,"Present legitimate acts, expand our appeal, go after the snobs."
397,If you only knew how suffocating they are.
398,So come join the circus.
399,You clearly have a flair for show business.
400,Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.
401, Are you serious?
402, Mmhmm.
403,"Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off and join the circus."
404,"Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?"
405,Let's just say that I find it much more comfortable admiring your show from afar.
406,"Comfort, the enemy of progress."
407,Do you understand that just associating with you could cost me my inheritance?
408,"Oh, it could cost you more than that."
409,You'd be risking everything.
410,"But, on the other hand, well, you just might find yourself a free man."
411,"âª âª âª Right here, right now, I put the offer out âª âª I don't wanna chase you down, I know you see it âª âª You run with me, and I can cut you free âª âª Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in âª âª So trade your typical for somethin' colorful âª âª And if it's crazy, live a little crazy âª âª You can play it sensible âª âª A king of conventional âª âª Or you can risk it all and see âª âª Don'tchu wanna get away âª âª From the same old part you gotta play? âª âª 'Cause I got what you need âª âª So come with me and take the ride âª âª It'll take you to the other side âª âª 'Cause you can do like you do or you can do like me âª âª Stay in the cage or you finally take the key âª âª Oh, damn âª âª Suddenly you're free to fly âª âª It'll take you to the other side âª âª Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in âª âª Well, I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen âª âª So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go âª âª 'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in âª âª Now, I admire you and that whole show you do âª âª You're on to somethin' âª âª Really, it's somethin' âª âª But I live among the swells âª âª And we don't pick up peanut shells âª âª I'll have to leave that up to you âª âª Don'tchu know that I'm okay âª âª With this uptown part I get to play? âª âª 'Cause I got what I need âª âª And I don't wanna take the ride âª âª I don't need to see the other side âª âª So go and do like you do, I'm good to do like me âª âª Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key âª âª Oh, damn âª âª Can'tchu see I'm doin' fine? âª âª I don't need to see the other side âª âª Now, is this really how you'd like to spend your days? âª âª Whisky, misery and parties and plays? âª âª If I were mixed up with you âª âª I'd be the talk of the town âª âª Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns âª âª But you would finally live a little âª âª Finally laugh a little âª âª Just let me give you the freedom to dream âª âª And it'll wake you up âª âª And cure your aching âª âª Take your walls and start 'em breaking âª âª Now that's a deal that seems worth taking âª âª But I guess I'll leave that up to you âª âª Well, it's intriguing âª âª But to go would cost me greatly âª âª So what percentage of the show âª âª Would I be taking? âª âª Well, fair enough âª âª You'd want a piece of all the action âª âª I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen âª âª I wasn't born this morning âª âª Eighteen would be just fine âª âª Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime? âª âª Fifteen âª  âª I'd do eight âª âª Twelve âª  âª Maybe nine âª âª Ten âª Umm..."
412,"Sir, it looks like you have yourself a junior partner."
413,What I have is an overcompensated apprentice.
414,"BOTH: âª Don'tchu wanna get away âª âª To a whole âª  âª New âª BOTH: âª Part you're gonna play âª  âª 'Cause I got âª  âª What you need âª BOTH: âª So come with me and take the ride âª âª To the other side âª âª So if you do like I do âª âª So if you do like me âª BOTH: âª Forget the cage âª âª 'Cause we know how to make the key âª âª Oh, damn âª âª Suddenly we're free to fly âª âª We're goin' to the other side âª  âª So if you do like I do âª  âª To the other side âª  âª So if you do like me âª  âª Goin' to the other side âª âª 'Cause if you do âª  âª We're goin' to the other side âª   âª We're goin' to the other side âª âª âª Who is that?"
415,"Hey, hey! No one's buying hats back here. Get out front, go!"
416,"W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce my newest hire, Mr. Phillip Carlyle."
417, It's a pleasure to meet you.
418," Yeah, pleasure."
419,"And what is your act, Mr. Carlyle?"
420,I don't have an act.
421,Everyone's got an act.
422,O'MALLEY: Mr. Barnum!
423,Yeah.
424,You better come see this.
425,"PHINEAS: Phillip, keep up!"
426,   A bit of a nasty element.
427,"There always is, isn't there?"
428,Nothing draws a crowd quite like a crowd.
429,We don't want you in our city!
430,"Go home, you freaks!"
431,Freaks!
432,"PHINEAS: ""Shame of the city."" ""The protests cement Mr. Barnum's reputation as a purveyor of the offensive and indecent"" ""Offensive and indecent."" Mr. Bennett, I am blushing."
433,"HELEN: No, I'm blushing.  WOMAN: What do you care what Bennett thinks?"
434, LETTIE: He's a prig.
435, And a snob.
436,"Yeah, and all the snobs in New York read him."
437,He does their thinking for them.
438,Whatever happened to thriving off controversy?
439,"Yeah, well... hey."
440, Do you have any thoughts on this?
441, HELEN: Phillip!
442,You know what?
443,"As a matter of fact, I do."
444," Helen, come on."
445,"  ""The Master of the Household ""has it in command of the Queen ""to invite Mr. Phineas T. Barnum ""and his theatrical troupe to a reception at Buckingham Palace."" The Queen Victoria? Is this real?"
446,I had to pull a few strings.
447,"If you want society to accept you, you may as well start..."
448," at the very, very top."
449,  Are we all invited?
450,I guess I'll just have to tell the Queen that either all of us go...
451,or none of us will.
452,The Queen of England!
453,Can't get much better than that.
454,PHILLIP: Why aren't we in tails?
455,PHINEAS: We're the entertainment.
456,LETTIE: Don't see you in a costume.
457,"Your Majesty, Mr. Phineas T. Barnum and his..."
458,Oddities from America!
459,WOMAN: Is that... is that real?
460,"(INDISTINCT WHISPERING, MURMURING) Your Majesty."
461,May I present Mr. Barnum.
462,"The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum."
463,And I've heard all about your little colonel from my friends in America.
464,"General, ma'am."
465,You're even smaller than I imagined.
466,"Well, you're not exactly reaching the top shelf yourself, sweetheart."
467,That went well.
468,STEWARD: Your Majesty.
469,PHINEAS: Phillip.
470,Miss Jenny Lind.
471,WOMAN: She is luminous.
472,Who's that?
473,PHILLIP: The opera singer?
474,"Singer, huh?"
475,She's the most famous performer in all of Europe.
476,She's sold out La Scala a dozen times.
477,Not to mention the French Opera.
478,Ah.
479, What are you doing?
480," Following you,  so you can introduce me to Miss Lind."
481, PHILLIP: Introduce you?
482, PHINEAS: Yeah.
483, PHILLIP: I don't know her.
484,Everybody knows her.
485,You just said so yourself.
486,"Yeah, exactly. You don't just march up to someone like this."
487,Why not? We're personable.
488,She's a person.
489,Miss Lind.
490,My name is Phillip Carlyle.
491,And this extraordinary gentleman next to me...
492,Phineas Taylor Barnum.
493,The pleasure's mine.
494,"Of course, you are the American."
495,I believe I might have heard of you.
496,"Oh, well, if you've heard of me all the way over here, I must be doing something right."
497,"That, or something very wrong."
498,"Well, in the world of publicity, there's hardly a difference."
499,"I believe those are the words of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum."
500,"A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman."
501,The best on my side of the Atlantic.
502,"Well, if you do say so yourself."
503,"I do, but I don't have to."
504," Oh, no. No."
505, Right?
506,"No, he is one of the best."
507,"Oh, that's very kind of you."
508,Miss Lind...
509,let me get to the point.
510,I'd like to bring you to New York.
511,"And if you agree, I'll make you the most famous singer not in Europe, but in the entire world."
512,Mmm.
513,And have you heard me sing?
514, Absolutely.
515," No. No, I haven't."
516,"But like mine, your reputation precedes you, and, well, I trust your reputation more than my own taste, so..."
517,I've never been to America.
518,You will sing in the grandest theater with the finest orchestra in the greatest city on Earth.
519,"""Jenny Lind."
520,"""One night only.""    Or maybe two."
521,"And at 20 percent of the gate, it'll be a queen's ransom for your efforts."
522,"I give most of my earnings to charity, Mr. Barnum."
523,To orphans and widows.
524,"""Voice of a Nightingale, Heart of an Angel."" That's brilliant. I mean, the press will go crazy for that story."
525,That's not a story.
526,"May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum?"
527,Anything Why me?
528,People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.
529,"Just once, I'd love to give them something real."
530,MAN: Miss Lind.
531,Everyone is here. Look at this.
532,Even the Winthrops.
533,Are you happy?
534,I will be if this works.
535,"Oh, God. I hope she can sing."
536,PHINEAS: What's taking her so long?
537,They're still taking their seats.
538, Speaking of which.
539, Yeah?
540,"Torn and Lettie, the others, they've just arrived."
541, What?
542,  Where should I put 'em? Your box?
543,"That box? No, no, no, that's a bit visible."
544, Visible?
545, The acoustics are actually better in the standing room.
546,That's where they should be.
547,Miss Lind's ready now.
548,"Okay. Thank you, thank God!"
549,This is so awesome.
550, Isn't it wonderful?
551, Yeah.
552, I love it.
553, Look at the curtain.
554,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience."
555,MAN: He's out of his element.
556,MAN 2: What is this about?
557,MAN 3: Is that Barnum?
558,WOMAN: This isn't the circus.
559,I recently had the privilege of hearing the most divine voice I've ever heard.
560,"Suddenly, he's a connoisseur."
561,"PHINEAS: Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug..."
562,but I have 100 bottles of good champagne on ice that says this isn't just another sideshow novelty.
563,May I present...
564,the Swedish Nightingale...
565,Miss Jenny Lind.
566,"âª âª âª I'm tryin' to hold my breath âª âª Let it stay this way âª âª Can't let this moment end âª âª You set off a dream in me âª âª Gettin' louder now âª âª Can you hear it echoing? âª âª Take my hand âª âª Will you share this with me? âª âª 'Cause, darlin', without you âª âª All the shine of a thousand spotlights âª âª All the stars we steal from the night sky âª âª Will never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª âª Towers of gold are still too little âª âª These hands could hold the world âª âª But it'll never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª âª For me âª âª Never, never âª âª Never, never âª âª Never, for me âª âª For me âª âª Never enough âª âª Never enough âª âª Never enough for me âª âª For me, for me âª âª All the shine of a thousand spotlights âª âª All the stars we steal from the night sky âª âª Will never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª âª Towers of gold are still too little âª âª These hands could hold the world âª âª But it'll never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª âª For me âª âª Never, never âª âª Never, never âª âª Never, for me âª âª For me âª âª Never enough âª âª Never, never âª âª Never enough âª âª Never, never âª âª Never enough âª âª For me, for me âª âª For me âª âª For me âª MAN: Brava!"

570,Bravissima!
571,More!
572,Excellent!
573,MAN 3: Brava!
574,Encore!
575,"Jenny, this is my wife, Charity, and our girls."
576,"Of course, and I've heard so much about you!"
577,And your father tells me you're a fan of the ballet.
578,"Yes, I'm studying ballet."
579,Are you?
580," Of course, lam."
581," And, of course, she is."
582,"And what about you, Helen?"
583,"You look like a princess, ma'am."
584,"I have to admit, Barnum..."
585,she is remarkable.
586,"Enough to bring joy to the most joyless critic, isn't she?"
587,"Mmm. And in the hands of a real purveyor of the arts,  she could be something in this country."
588,"  Shame, she's fallen in with you."
589,"You really are better on the page, Mr. Bennett, hard as that is to believe."
590,"WOMAN: Mr. Barnum, I'd love to meet Miss Lind."
591, PHINEAS: And you will meet Miss Lind.
592, WOMAN: Would you introduce us?
593, If you just give me a moment...
594, Phineas.
595,Yes.
596,You've... done well.
597,Thank you.
598,Allow me to introduce you.
599,"Uh, excuse me, Jenny."
600,I'd like you to meet Charity's parents.
601,Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.
602,"Ah, pleasure."
603, How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
604, Good to meet you.
605, Mother.
606," Hello, dear."
607,   MRS. HALLETT: Are these...
608,"Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters."
609," Phineas, not here."
610, Not here?
611,You afraid I'm gonna embarrass your parents in front of their fancy friends?
612,I... I really don't think I have that power.
613,An insignificant man like me who was clearly destined to lead an insignificant life.
614,"All that fortune, and still just the tailor's boy."
615,Get out.
616,"Well, Phineas..."
617,I believe I told you that free champagne is a recipe for disaster.
618, Charity.
619, Now would everyone please  raise their glasses?
620, PHINEAS: Charity.
621,"To Mr. Barnum, who has shown once and for all that a man's station is limited only by his imagination."
622, To Barnum! To Barnum!
623, Thank you.
624,To Mr. Barnum.
625,Thank you.
626,It's hard to understand wealth and privilege when you're born into it.
627,I sometimes don't feel like I belong here.
628,You?
629,I was born out of wedlock...
630,and that brought shame upon my family.
631,And life always manages to remind me that I don't deserve a place in this world.
632,And that... leaves a hole that no ovation can ever fill.
633, Mr. Phineas!
634, Guys...
635,"Lord, that lady can sing!"
636,I know.
637,Think she likes a man in uniform?
638,I'm sure she does.
639,"Okay, what are you doing here?"
640,"You got a show in an hour, okay?"
641,"That's enough time for us to have at least three drinks, right?"
642," Come on, let's go."
643," No, no, no. Lettie!"
644, What?
645," It's very crowded in here, okay?"
646,And I can't have you mingling... guys!
647,Who's gonna pay admission if you're out there for all the world to see?
648, Okay? Have a great show.
649, Wait.
650,"   PHINEAS: Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!"
651,"Jenny, America may not know it yet..."

657,Why do you need to tour the country?
658,Why did Napoleon march on Russia?
659,Napoleon was defeated.
660,Napoleon didn't have a 60piece orchestra.
661,A 60piece orchestra?
662,Just get the cheapest musicians you can and watch that.
663,We'll still have to board them.
664,"We'll get married ones, they can share a bunk."
665,"O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank."
666, PHILLIP: Custom sets?
667, PHINEAS: Yeah.
668, PHILLIP: Fireworks?
669, PHINEAS: Uhhuh.
670,Inside theaters?
671,That's genius.
672,"No. Hey, P.T."
673,These are the most famous theaters in the country.
674,They make you buy the seats in advance just to book them.
675,Yeah. I took out a loan.
676, And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
677, It was a large loan. Okay?
678,You're not gonna see a penny of profit until your 40th show...
679,You're risking everything you've built here.
680,How do you think I built it?
681,We'll have plenty of profits to go around after this.
682, P.T.?
683, What?
684,Your attention has been divided long enough.
685,"Our gate is down, we have more protesters every day."
686,You just need to get people to come back.
687,"""If you haven't been to the Barnum Museum lately, you haven't been at the Barnum Museum."" They come to see you."
688,Your crazy ideas...
689,"your new acts, the unusual."
690,"Well, then how about you show them a smile? That'd be unusual."
691,Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear I expect them to afford you all the deference you deserve and that they should be nice to you anyway.
692,LETTIE: Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?
693,"Couldn't even say ""hello."" Or ""goodbye."" He's going on tour."
694," Sorry, guys."
695," Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle."
696,Don't you have somewhere to be?
697,    Anne Wheeler.
698,Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.
699,I'm... I'm sorry.
700,I... I believe there's only supposed to be one.
701,"No, there's meant to be two."
702,I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.
703,MAN: Five minutes to curtain.
704,    I've always wanted to go to the theater.
705,"MR. CARLYLE: Phillip, is that you?"
706,Mother. Father.
707,This is Anne Wheeler.
708,Phillip...
709,have you no shame?
710,Associating yourself with that Barnum business is one thing...
711,but parading around with the help?
712,Anne.
713,Anne! Anne!
714,How dare you speak to her like that.
715,"You forget your place, Phillip."
716,My Place?
717,"Mother, if this is my place..."
718,then I don't want any part of it.
719,Anne.
720,They're smallminded people.
721,Why do you care what they think?
722,It's not just them.
723,You've never had somebody look at you the way your parents looked at me.
724,The way everyone would look at us.
725,"âª You know I want you âª âª It's not a secret I try to hide âª âª I know you want me âª âª So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied âª âª You claim it's not in the cards âª âª And fate is pulling you miles away âª âª And out of reach from me âª âª But you're here in my heart âª âª So who can stop me if I decide âª âª That you're my destiny? âª âª What if we rewrite the stars? âª âª Say you were made to be mine? âª âª Nothing could keep us apart âª âª You'd be the one I was meant to find âª âª It's up to you âª âª And it's up to me âª âª No one can say what we get to be âª âª So why don't we rewrite the stars? âª âª Maybe the world could be ours âª âª Tonight âª âª You think it's easy? âª âª You think I don't want to run to you? âª âª But there are mountains âª âª And there are doors that we can't walk through âª âª I know you're wonderin' why âª âª Because we're able to be âª âª Just you and me within these walls âª âª But when we go outside âª âª You're gonna wake up and see âª âª That it was hopeless after all âª âª No one can rewrite the stars âª âª How can you say you'll be mine? âª âª Ev'rything keeps us apart âª âª And I'm not the one you were meant to find âª âª It's not up to you âª âª It's not up to me âª âª When everyone tells us what we can be âª âª How can we rewrite the stars? âª âª Say that the world can be ours âª âª Tonight? âª BOTH: âª All I want is to fly with you âª âª All I want is to fall with you âª âª So just give me all of you âª  âª It feels impossible âª  âª It's not impossible âª âª Is it impossible? âª BOTH: âª Say that it's possible âª âª How do we rewrite the stars? âª âª Say you were made to be mine? âª âª Nothing can keep us apart âª âª 'Cause you are the one I was meant to find âª âª It's up to you and it's up to me âª âª No one can say what we get to be âª âª Why don't we rewrite the stars? âª âª Changin' the world to be ours âª âª You know I want you âª âª It's not a secret I try to hide âª âª But I can't have you âª âª We're bound to break and my hands are tied âª First, it was buying a house on the same street as my parents."
726,"Then, meeting the Queen."
727,"Then bringing Jenny Lind, then my father the other night."
728,When will it ever be enough for you?
729,I'm doing this for Caroline and Helen.
730,Look around you. They have everything.
731, You don't understand.
732, I do understand.
733,"No, you don't understand."
734,How could you?
735,My father was treated like dirt.
736,I was treated like dirt...
737,and my children will not be.
738,"You don't need everyone to love you, Phin."
739,Just a few good people.
740,I know that.
741,Sir.
742,"No, no! Daddy!"
743,Daddy!
744,"Daddy, no! Wait!"
745, Daddy!
746, PHINEAS: Go!
747,"Wait, Daddy!"

751, The world at our feet.
752," Well, Mr. Barnum."
753,     This...
754,is...
755,to making dreams come true.
756,"Thank you, Jenny."
757,It's two hours to curtain.
758,"I've given you the world, haven't I?"
759,"I... I, uh... I should go. I..."
760,I've become a distraction.
761,"I'm sorry, Jenny."
762, No.
763, You should finish the tour without me.
764,What? You're leaving?
765," Well, the itinerary's well in hand."
766," So, that's it."
767,What do you mean?
768,I'm just another one of your little acts.
769, Jenny.
770, I'm done.
771,"Jenny. Jenny, please."
772,You have to finish the tour.
773,Must I?
774,It... it will ruin me.
775," When you're careless with other people, Mr. Barnum, you bring ruin upon yourself."
776,I have risked everything.
777,"Well, so did I."
778,And it seems we both lost.
779,âª All the stars we steal from the night sky âª âª Will never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª âª Towers of gold are still too little âª âª These hands could hold the world âª âª But it'll never be enough âª âª Never be enough âª Thank you.
780,What was that?
781,That was goodbye.
782,"PHILLIP: Hey, thank you very much for coming."
783, Tell your friends and neighbors!
784, What a wonderful show!
785,Who enjoyed themselves? You? You?
786,Tell everyone how much fun you had at the circus!
787,New acts every night!
788,MAN: Hey! Ringmaster.
789,"Gentlemen, gonna have to ask you to leave."
790,"   This is our town, son."
791,We think you should leave.
792,You and your freaks.
793,And your spooks.
794,PHILLIP: Sir.
795,I will only ask once more.
796,"Then what, boy?"
797,Hey! Stop!
798,Get him!
799,Charge!
800,     WOMAN: Could that be her?
801, MAN: I think so.
802,GIRLS: Daddy!
803,   Daddy!
804," Girls, girls, girls!"
805, Daddy!
806,"Oh, you've grown so much. Stop it."
807,What made you decide to come back early?
808,I missed you. I missed you.
809, That sounds an awful lot like humbug.
810,   Fire!
811, Move aside! Move aside!
812, Come on!
813, Hurry! It's coming from the circus.
814,MAN: Run! Let's go! Fire!
815,"Girls, stay with me. Come. Quick, quick!"
816,"Everyone, stay close!"
817,Phillip! Is everyone out?
818, Is everyone okay?
819, Yeah.
820,The animals? The animals?
821,"Yeah, we set them free."
822,What else could we do?
823,"W.D., where's Anne?"
824,PHINEAS: Where's Anne? Where's Anne?
825,"No, Phillip! No!"
826," Hey, hey! Outside!"
827, You can't go in there!
828, Anne!

847,Up!
848,"âª What if we rewrite the stars? âª âª Say you were made to be mine? âª âª Nothing can keep us apart âª âª You are the one I was meant to find âª MAN: Here we go, guys!"

850,"Thomas, help me break this up."
851,"If you've come to gloat, I wouldn't."
852,Tm 21:22; 'P; 'are?
853,I thought you'd like to know.
854,I never liked your show.
855,But I always thought the people did.
856,They did. They do.
857,"Mind you, I wouldn't call it art."
858,Of course not.
859,But...
860,putting folks of all kinds on stage with you...
861,"all colors... shapes, sizes..."
862,presenting them as equals...
863,"Why, another critic might have even called it..."
864,"""a celebration of humanity."" I would've liked that."
865,Mmm.
866," Well, I hope you'll rebuild."
867, Hmm.
868,"I mean, thank God for Jenny's tour."
869,"We can borrow off the profits, we'll be fine."
870,You don't know?
871,Hmm?
872,I'm sorry.
873,Charity?
874,"On, God, Charity."
875, I am...
876, I don't wanna talk to you.
877,N... nothing happened. This is ridiculous.
878,"Oh, sure. Nothing happened."
879,It's on the cover of every paper in New York.
880,Because she orchestrated the photo.
881,I'm not in love with her!
882,Of course you're not.
883,"Not with her, not with me, not with anyone."
884,Just you and your show.
885, What are you doing?
886,I'm going home.
887,This is your home.
888,The bank...
889,they're evicting us.
890,Why didn't you ask me before...
891,I would've said yes.
892,"I never minded the risk, but we always did it together."
893,Figured you'd end up here.
894, Feeling sorry for yourself.
895,"  Folks, if you've come to get paid, the money is gone. All of it."
896, Nothing left to give you.
897," Shut up, Barnum."
898,You just don't get it.
899,Our own mothers were ashamed of us.
900,Hid us our whole lives.
901,Then you pull us out of the shadows.
902,"And now you're giving up on us, too."
903,Maybe you are a fraud.
904,Maybe it was just about making a buck.
905,But you gave us a real family.
906,And the circus... that was our home.
907,We want our home back.
