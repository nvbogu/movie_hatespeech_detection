0,"like everything about her, gave promise of something mighty and splendid."
1,They called her Titanic.
2,"She was the longest, the tallest, the most luxurious ship in all creation."
3,"Before her initial Atlantic crossing was to end, she would achieve another, and this time unexpected, distinction, as the first ocean liner ever to use the code signal sos."
4,"At noon, April 10th, 1912, she steamed out of southampton into the english channel."
5,"At night, she dropped anchor at cherbourg, France, and again the next morning at queenstown in Ireland to receive additional cargo and passengers, then took to the open sea."
6,"At 11:40 P.M., April 14th, some 400 miles off the coast of newfoundland, calamity struck."
7,"Within a matter of hours, the magnificent, unsinkable Titanic vanished forever in water more than two miles deep."
8,"Only the swift and courageous action of a small passenger liner, the carpathia, prevented a greater devastation."
9,"Even so, it was and remains to this day the worst maritime disaster in the history of the north Atlantic."
10,"Good night, ladies."
11,"Good night, ladies."
12,"Good night, ladies."
13,I'm going to leave you now.
14,"Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along, merrily we roll along, o'er the deep blue..."
15,Blimey.
16, Officer Dwight.
17, Who's that?
18," Cottam, sir."
19, What's the problem?
20, I've had an urgent message.
21, At this hour?
22,I thought you switched off at midnight.
23, It's the Titanic.
24, Titanic?
25,She's sinking.
26,"Sinking, that's impossible, she's unsinkable."
27,The message is to come at once.
28, Sir? Captain?
29, Hm?
30,"Captain, sir! Sir, wake up!"
31,"I'm awake, I'm awake, I was only just dropping off."
32, Who is this?
33," It's first officer Dean, sir."
34,"Bloody hell, Dean!"
35,Since when do you push your way in here without knocking?
36,"Sorry, sir, it's an emergency."
37,I don't care a blue damn what it is.
38,I want to see some discipline on this ship.
39,"Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir."
40, Who's that with you?
41," It's cottam, sir."
42, Cottam?
43," Wireless operator, sir."
44," Oh, yes."
45, He's had an urgent communication from the Titanic.
46,The Titanic?
47,"Well, what is it?"
48,"It's a cqd, sir."
49,Cq...
50, Are you sure?
51," Yes, sir."
52,They used the new distress signal as well.
53,Sos.
54,She's struck an iceberg.
55,She's 58 miles away.
56,Our course is north 52 west.
57,"Now get back to your man on the Titanic, tell him we're coming as fast as we can that we should be there in just four hours' time."
58,Four hours?
59, Did you get through all right?
60," Yes, sir, I told him within four hours just like you said."
61, And what was his reply?
62," He said, ""please hurry, young man, engine room flooded, we're sinking head down."" Then there was nothing."
63, We're here.
64," We've arrived, sir."
65,Call out all hands.
66,All boats to be readied and swung out.
67, Open all gangway doors.
68, A pilot ladder at each gangway and a chair sling for bringing up the sick or wounded.
69,The canvas bags for children.
70,We're going to receive survivors.
71, Swing the Derrick around.
72," Aye aye, sir."
73,Shall I go first?
74,"Come on, now."
75,Hold on!
76,"Keep clutching it, we've got you."
77,That's it.
78,Just a few more steps.
79,"Come on now, good girl."
80,What ship is this?
81,The carpathia.
82,Carpathia.
83,And the Titanic?
84,Gone.
85,What time is it?
86,Twenty minutes past two.
87,Approximately three hours after the collision.
88,Slightly less than three.
89,"With how many still aboard, would you estimate?"
90,"Hundreds, all the boats together assuming every one got away with a full load wouldn't have held half of those aboard."
91,Chances are more than a thousand went down.
92,"Another boat on the starboard bow, sir."
93,And another beyond that.
94,Ease away the winch.
95,"Just follow the steward, ma'am."
96,"Good morning, the steward will direct you to the dining saloon where there's food and drink and medicine if you need it."
97,Will you kindly give your name to my assistant.
98,Mr. ismay of the white star line.
99,I'm ismay.
100, And the Titanic was...
101, My ship.
102,"Mr. ismay, sir?"
103,"I'm Dr. McGee, ship's surgeon."
104,"Won't you come inside now, sir, where it's warm?"
105,And we can try to make you comfortable.
106,Comfortable?
107,"What's the good of standing out here in the cold this way, sir?"
108,"Look, look."
109,"There's something in the water, just there."
110," I don't see anything, sir."
111," Look, look, it's just there."
112,"Use your eyes, why don't you?"
113,"It's only a bit of flotsam, sir."
114,Are you sure?
115,A few deck chairs by the look of it.
116,That's all.
117,"All I can see, sir."
118,A few chairs.
119,All that beauty.
120,"All that strength, power, grace."
121,A few chairs.
122,So much gaiety.
123,So much for the smoking room and the palm court.
124,The electronic lifts are over there behind the staircase and then forward of that there are some 30odd cabins.
125,Now this will take us up to the boat deck.
126,Are we going back to the bridge and the wheelhouse?
127,"No, no, no, no, I don't think so, they won't want anyone underfoot just now."
128,Come on. Excuse me.
129,Thank you.
130,"Look there, it's almost sailing time!"
131," Oh, such a beautiful clock."
132," Thank you, darling."
133,I chose it myself.
134,It's meant to be honor and glory crowning time.
135,"They ought to be crowning you, ismay."
136,Hello.
137,"Never mind, every sort of honor and glory will be coming your way after today."
138,We all thought the olympic the last word.
139,This really is the summit.
140, Congratulations.
141, Too kind.
142, Who was that?
143," A countryman of yours, my dear."
144, John Jacob astor and his bride.
145, His child bride.
146,"Oh, I think half the millionaires in America have booked passage on this crossing."
147,"This way, one and all!"
148,All ashore that's going ashore!
149,All ashore that's going ashore!
150,All ashore that's going ashore!
151,"This is the way to second class, isn't it?"
152," Straight ahead, miss."
153, Thank you.
154,All ashore that's going ashore!
155,Excuse me.
156, I'm sailing.
157," Yes, well so am I, as it happens."
158,Aha!
159,The man of the hour himself!
160,"Hail to thee, chief designer!"
161,"How are you, Bruce? Julia?"
162,"Look here, I've been taking bows for your handiwork all morning."
163,"I don't seem to be able to convince anyone that you built it, and I just commissioned it, so I've stopped trying."
164,"What are you togged out for, Tom?"
165,"You're not still working, are you?"
166,Just tightening up the odd bolt here and there.
167,"Tommy, you've got an army of helpers for that."
168,"Yes, but if I do it myself, then I've no one but me to blame if it's not done properly."
169,"Any road, I enjoy it."
170,"Now come on, own up, you're a perfectionist, aren't you?"
171,A hard case.
172,"You know, I expect this will do me for exercise."
173,Probably stand me in good stead in case of an emergency too.
174,"Darling, don't even jest."
175,My darling Julia.
176,There is not one chance in a million that anything could possibly go wrong.
177,She passed her trials without the slightest incident.
178,"Well, she's perfect."
179,"Here, you two, come and be immortalized."
180,"Is it true that this is to be your last voyage, captain?"
181,"And that... you're going out in a Blaze of glory, as it were?"
182,"Not quite, not quite, though I do see retirement in my immediate future."
183,"I'm looking forward to a long, tranquil time in dry dock before they finally sell me for scrap, as it were."
184,"Now, how is this?"
185,Keep coming. Keep coming.
186,"Smile, darling."
187,Walk right on past me.
188,That's it.
189," Tugs are all fast, sir."
190, Good.
191,"Mr. bowyer, we're in your expert hands until we reach the nab."
192,May we have your orders?
193,We have a rendezvous this evening in France.
194,"Thank you, sir."
195,Let go your stern ropes.
196,Let go the stern ropes.
197,"Aft tug away, sir."
198,Slow ahead.
199,"Slow ahead it is, sir."
200,"Gentlemen, we're under way."
201,"Since there was no formal launching, I should just like to say."
202,God bless this ship and all who sail in her.
203,"I'm sorry, madam, I had no business."
204,"No, no, it suits you. Let's see."
205,It's a very good color for you.
206,You're bigger here than I am.
207,I will?
208,It's yours when we reach New York.
209,"Oh, no, madam, I couldn't possibly."
210,"You like it, don't you?"
211,It's the most beautiful dress I've ever seen.
212,Then it's settled.
213," Oh, no, but I... I can't."
214, Shh.
215,Did you find everything you need?
216,Yes.
217,"There's no bidet in the bathroom, of course, but then, it's not a French ship, it's a British ship."
218,One mustn't expect miracles.
219,"Mrs. astor likes her comfort, huh?"
220,"I'm awfully spoiled, aren't I, for the rather ordinary daughter of a man who runs a forwarding firm in Brooklyn."
221,You were never ordinary.
222,I don't care who your father is.
223,And you're not half as spoiled as you're going to be when I'm through with you.
224,Did you spoil Ava when you were first married?
225,"Nobody spoils Ava, she's the one that spoils things."
226,Everything.
227,"I got used to her insulting me, calling me stupid and clumsy."
228,I never got used to her cruelty to Vincent.
229,"From the time he was no bigger than that, shaming him in front of her guests."
230,He's about the same age as you are now.
231,I don't suppose he's ever heard a kind word from her.
232,"Everywhere he goes, people say, ""ah, your mother, the greatest beauty of the age."" He just looks at them."
233,I'm not beautiful.
234,"Yes, you are."
235,Not like her.
236,But I can be kind.
237,I can be infinitely kind.
238,"Dear sis, I have only just now come off watch, and I am dashing this off to you, old chum, as I know you will be anxious for word of the great occasion."
239,We had a near thing leaving southampton.
240,A ship docked nearby was nearly sucked into a collision by the force of our propellers.
241,"But never mind, no harm done."
242,"Although one bloke in first class insisted on being put ashore in cherbourg, saying it was a bad omen or some such rubbish."
243,"The loading in France went off without a hitch, and we're now underway again."
244,It's a typical first night out.
245,"Pretty quiet, as always in any ship."
246,"The passengers haven't got the feel of it yet, and in this case neither have the crew."
247,The sheer distance from one end to the other is such I expect it will be a fortnight at least before I find the shortest route.
248,What do you think of it?
249,I don't know what to think.
250,It gives me the shivers.
251,"Big is one thing, but that?"
252,"It'll seem small enough, no doubt, when we're a thousand miles from any land and nothing but the great ocean all around."
253,"You've been to sea before, then?"
254,I haven't.
255,Me neither.
256,"What are those, Kate?"
257,I don't know.
258,Bumboats.
259,Bumboats? What's a bumboat for?
260,Boats that carry things to sell aboard ships when they ride into dock.
261,"Now didn't my brother travel all around the orient, that time he was a merchant seaman."
262,And then he used to write home about things.
263,"What's your pleasure, ladies?"
264,Here's the finest Irish linen in all creation.
265,Here's linen as fine as anything you'll find.
266,"Will you look this way, Mrs. astor? Smile, please."
267,"Mr. astor, could you tell us, how do you and your bride  feel to be on board the Titanic?"
268, No more.
269,"LouiseKate, I didn't know you were on board."
270,May I... may I introduce my wife?
271, Friends of Ava's?
272, Yes.
273, Doesn't matter.
274, Of course it matters.
275,"Oh, Johnny, look at this!"
276,"Oh, isn't it lovely?"
277,"Ah, the lady shows great taste."
278,That's a prime example of the art of making caliber class lace.
279,Very nice.
280,See how full it is in the waist?
281,I'll need that in a few weeks when I've begun to show.
282,Think of the poor women who risk their precious eyesight to produce a stitch that fine.
283,How much is it?
284,"Well, uh, in round figures..."
285,What I'll have before long.
286, Â£160.
287, You're joking.
288,"Oh, not a bit of it."
289, Â£1607?
290, $800.
291,That's ridiculous!
292,"No, thank you."
293,I'll give you $400.
294,$800 by your own reckoning.
295,"Let's make it even, $600."
296,And $200 makes $800.
297,You're a hard man.
298,"Come to think of it, it's a hard life, you know, now."
299,Maggie!
300,Maggie?
301,Maggie!
302,I beg your pardon.
303,Are you addressing me?
304,How's it gonna look on the marquee when I make my legitimate stage debut?
305,Maggie brown?
306,"Oh, I'm sorry."
307,Molly. Molly!
308, I keep forgetting.
309, So do 1.
310,"Hello, Emma. Are you two dining with us tonight?"
311,Try and stop us.
312,"Look, darling."
313,What would you think of this done up as a kind of walking suit?
314,All this stuff just brings out the Irish in me with a vengeance.
315,"Of course, you gotta tell me if it's apt to make me look like Patty's pig."
316,"Single ladies, this way."
317,Come along please.
318,"Never mind, we'll get you sorted out."
319,"This alleyway's something, innit?"
320,The officers have nicknamed it park Lane after the poshest street in London.
321,That's irony.
322,"The crew calls it Scotland road, which if you've never been to liverpool, you know, it's thoroughly disreputable."
323,My ticket's for a cabin that's already full up.
324,"Oh, well, come on then, join the parade."
325,"You know, you've got to expect these little mishaps  on a brand new ship."
326, Single ladies this way.
327,"Oh, I'm sorry."
328,"Mary Agatha, is it?"
329,Bridget. Bridget Bradley.
330, I'm Mary Agatha.
331, I'll get it straight.
332,The pair of you's the problem.
333,"Just remember, she's Kate and I'm Katie."
334,"Shocking business, isn't it?"
335,Putting four of us in a space this small.
336,"Small, is it?"
337,Seems massive to me.
338, Go on!
339, She means it.
340,She's one of ten kids.
341,And two rooms in the house.
342,We was all times three and four to a bed.
343, English speaking.
344, Reluctantly.
345,"Good. Here, lads, you can stow your cases underneath the bunks there."
346,"And the lavatory's right 'round the bend, which is where I shall be before this trip's over, I can tell ya."
347,"Well, it looks like we're gonna be sharing."
348,This here is David charters.
349, David.
350, 'Tis very good.
351,"I'm Farrell, James, Jim."
352, We're from London.
353," Gallagher, Martin. Donegal."
354,You're a long ways from home.
355,"Buckley, Daniel. Daniel Buckley."
356,"Why not take the upper there, you're smaller than Martin."
357,There's trouble getting in and out.
358,Right.
359,"Not exactly the royal hibernian, is it?"
360,"The royal hibernian, what's that?"
361,That's the swankiest hotel in Dublin is what that is.
362,Oh.
363,"Been much to Dublin then, have ya?"
364,We passed through on our way down here.
365,And did you stay at the royal whatever you call it?
366,Are you daft or what?
367,We have sod all between us.
368,We stayed at the westland road station is where we stayed.
369,Long enough to change trains.
370,"And last night in cobh, which the bloody minded British insist on calling queenstown."
371,We slept rough in a little park.
372,The girls stayed in a guest house.
373, The girls?
374," Well, two girls from our town  traveled down with us."
375, Name of gilnagh and mullins.
376,The two Kates.
377," Mother mercy, what's that now?"
378, An explosion.
379,"Not to worry, they've just started the engines, that's all."
380,You happen to be quite near the casing.
381, Are we moving?
382, We will be in two shakes.
383,"Heaven help me, I'm going to be seasick, I know."
384,"Well, think that way and you will."
385,"Is it ""abandon ship"" or ""run for your life"" or what is it at all?"
386, It's lunch.
387, Dadada! Dadada!
388,"Do you make that racket every time it's lunch, then?"
389,And breakfast and dinner.
390,"Third class dining saloon, one deck down. Thank you."
391,Dinner? They call tea dinner?
392,What swank.
393,I never had dinner in my life.
394,"We're on our way to ruin, the bunch of us."
395,Good.
396," Daniel, my stomach's growling."
397, Almost finished.
398,"Daniel, be careful. Watch out."
399, Oh!
400," Oh, I'm sorry."
401,No harm done.
402," Oh, watch out."
403," It's all right, folks."
404,This reel is nearly used up.
405,"That's quite an expensive toy, isn't it?"
406,It was a wedding present.
407,"My dad's in the business, moving pictures."
408,"Well, tell him to save his money and invest it in something with a future, like vaudeville."
409,Henry's a theatrical producer.
410,Broadway.
411, Henry Harris. How are you?
412, Dan Marvin.
413," This is my wife, Mary."
414, How do you do?
415, Pleased to meet you. I'm Rene.
416, Do you really think the movies are a flash in the pan?
417,"Well, my father always used to say sinking cash into shortterm novelties was like waiting for ships that never come in."
418,Sinking ships?
419,Is that supposed to be funny?
420, Only by accident.
421, Enough about accidents.
422,Let's eat.
423,"Oh, I'm sorry."
424,"It's all right, miss Sloan."
425,It's only me.
426,Mr. Andrews?
427,"Yes, the astors have gone down to lunch."
428,I just nipped in to give a prod to that fan you reported out of order.
429,Were you taking a last look at Ireland?
430,"Yes, yes. Isn't it foolish?"
431,We're hardly away yet and I'm homesick already.
432,Where do you come from?
433,"Comber, county down, but I live in belfast now."
434, So do I.
435, Do you? Where?
436," Kersland road, strandtown."
437," Yes, yes, of course."
438,My wife and I used to go for a stroll in Victoria park when we were courting.
439, Do you have any children?
440," One. A little girl, Elizabeth."
441,She cried when we said goodbye.
442,"If you ever want to talk to anybody about home, just come along to the linen room."
443,"We have a little electric hearth in there, we could give you a cup of tea."
444,"Thank you, I'd like that."
445," Good evening, my lady."
446, Good evening.
447,She dines late.
448,"Well, she's a countess."
449,When you're a countess you dine when you dogwell feel like it.
450,"Oh, I'm sorry, darling."
451," Countess of what, Maggie?"
452, Of rothes.
453,"Thank you, cyril."
454,And don't call me Maggie.
455,I find her fascinating.
456,She looks just the way I've always wanted to.
457,Worldly and mysterious.
458,"Darling, I wouldn't trade you for all the countesses in Burke's peerage."
459,Talk about mysterious.
460,"Take a squint back there, down there in the corner."
461,"What, ya ask yourself, is that gay dog Ben guggenheim doing at a table all by himself for two?"
462,"Well, the story..."
463,"The story is he finally broke it off with her nibs, the marquise de cerruti, and now he's on his way home to see florette and the kids for the first time in seven or eight months."
464, What's wrong?
465," Oh, nothing."
466,He's such an attractivelooking man.
467,"Oh, I'll tell the world, he can leave his patent leathers outside my door any night."
468, Maggie!
469," Molly, darn it, Emma!"
470,"Scandalous. This conversation's a little spicy for me, ladies, if you'll excuse me."
471,"I'm going to the smoke room to have a very, very mild cigar."
472,"Well, now we can loosen our corsets and let our hair down."
473,"Walk me to the ladies room, I'll save my foot in there, cyril."
474,"Yes, Mrs. brown."
475,Did I really bother jj with my nonsense?
476,"Oh, of course not, you're good for him."
477,You make him laugh.
478,Lord knows he needs it.
479,"After all, he's suffered on my account."
480," Oh, boo."
481," No, it's true."
482,That's why I frowned when you mentioned Mr. guggenheim and his wife and children.
483,John still hasn't got over the insults and snubs that came after his divorce.
484,And worse after we were married.
485,"Well, because he loved me, he thought his friends would accept me automatically."
486,His friends do.
487,"As for the others, to hell with them."
488,"He can't say that, Molly."
489,It's desperately important to him.
490, It's his life.
491, Cheer up.
492,Everything's gonna look a whole lot better after the baby's born.
493,"You've got so much happiness in store for you, honey."
494, Come on then! Jimmy! Jimmy!
495, Thanks very much.
496," Your health, Jimmy."
497, Slainte.
498,Up the Irish.
499,"God, this is fierce."
500,No different to what it was back home.
501,I know what you mean.
502,"Girls on one side, boys on the other and never the twain shall meet."
503,"Now, the problem as I see it, is that we're all the time having dances and we don't know how to dance."
504,"I don't, for one, and I'm jiggered if I'll apologize for it."
505,Damn silly business in my view.
506,I can dance.
507," Can you, Martin?"
508," I can so, it's only I haven't seen the girl yet."
509,"What girl is that, Martin?"
510,The girl I'll be out there dancing with.
511,"Good luck, old son."
512,It looks a pretty narrow field from where I'm sitting.
513,"Sit down, you idiot."
514,"Hold that, will you?"
515,Don't be doing that.
516,"Stop it now, do you hear?"
517,Hello?
518,Hello?
519,"Turn off your light, Mr. moon man."
520,Go and hide your face behind a cloud.
521,"Can't you see that couples want to spoon, man?"
522,Two is company and three's a crowd I'll take my lady to a shady place where I can hug my lady.
523,And we'll say to you goodnight.
524,Ohoh.
525,"Oh, Emma, to be 17 again!"
526,Or even 39.
527,"I don't think there's a worse place to be on your own than a big romantic ship like this, unless it's Niagara Falls."
528,You just know there's so much love going on.
529,You lie there in the dark and watch the shadows moving past that little crack of light under your cabin door.
530,"Footsteps coming close, footsteps going away."
531,A soft knock on a door and a soft voice answers.
532,A door closes.
533,You wonder if you're the only one sleeping one to a bed tonight.
534, Maggie...
535, I'm gonna brain you if you don't stop calling me Maggie.
536, Sit up straight.
537, Was I slouching?
538,"I'm not concerned with your posture, honey, you're blocking my view."
539,View of what?
540,There's a bozo sitting over there behind...
541,"Don't look now, he's glancing this way."
542,Like he's getting up courage to ask me if my program's full up for the evening.
543,"Not exactly love's young dream, but he wouldn't turn your stomach."
544, Maggie.
545, Molly!
546,Molly... you surely wouldn't dance with a perfect stranger.
547,Certainly not.
548,"Emma bucknell, what in the world are you thinking of?"
549,OlÃ©!
550,"""Saw another ice field with two icebergs, latitude 45"" 20"", longitude 49'."" Jack? Jack, are you awake?"
551,This has got to go straight up to the bridge.
552,Sam out.
553,"You'd like to go on the Fritz, wouldn't you, you Randy little beast."
554,"Oh, it's the twinkle like the stars above for me..."
555,"You might have got off with a stewardess or two on the Mauritania, but the Titanic's a different keg of ale, I can tell ya."
556,Captain Smith's a right stickler for discipline.
557,"Yeah, but, bootsy, look at it this way."
558,"He has to sleep sometime, don't he?"
559,And what happens when the captain sleeps?
560,Answer me that.
561,And the little words that say you love me...
562,I'm here by invitation.
563,"A cup of tea, you said."
564,"And just in time you are, too."
565,"Miss jessop's about to pour, aren't you, Violet?"
566,All right.
567,"Shall I be mother, then?"
568,Fresh scones from the first class bakery.
569,Can I tempt you?
570,I'm tempted.
571,What do you find to read in that rather primitive library?
572,I beg your pardon?
573,"They don't seem to have anything except what the library steward calls ""light shipboard reading""."
574,"""Stover at Yale"", ""hopalong Cassidy""."
575,I was wondering how you found anything so engrossing.
576,"Well, this isn't one of theirs."
577,I'm just catching up with fischer's work on proteins.
578," Rather dull stuff, I'm afraid."
579, You're a scientist?
580,"No, nothing so colorful."
581,I teach.
582,I'm a science master at dulwich college.
583,Not college in the American sense.
584,It's a boys' school.
585,What a coincidence.
586,I'm a teacher too.
587,At a girls' school in the states.
588,That is a coincidence.
589,Yes.
590,I'm rather bored with this.
591,Would you care for a stroll?
592,That would be nice.
593, I'm on my way...
594, I'm on my way...
595, Please go on.
596, Please go on.
597, You first.
598, I was only going to say I'm on my way to the states for my first visit.
599,Leave of absence.
600,I made a tour of India with a group of teachers from all over the world.
601,Now I'm on my way home.
602,I'm on leave too.
603,Another coincidence.
604,"This is a funny place to be, isn't it?"
605, We're the middle.
606, The middle?
607,The middle class.
608,Haven't you noticed?
609,This ship is a microcosm of the British social system.
610,"A maze of barriers erected to keep them from getting where we are, and to keep us from getting where they are."
611,"Yes, but it's not social, is it?"
612,It's purely economic.
613,Any rich upstart can get his pick of accommodation up there and any nobleman short of funds might find himself traveling down there.
614,"S50, in a sense, the thing is constructed on the American principle of equal opportunity based on the ability to pay."
615,"Well, I don't see any Dukes or earls milling about. Do you?"
616,"Well, none wearing a coronet."
617,Look at that chap there.
618,I saw him yesterday and the day before as well.
619,Always keeps to himself.
620,Always immaculately dressed.
621,Never goes out without gloves.
622,I've evolved a theory about him.
623,Go on.
624,"Well, he's been a failure in one way or other at home and his family has packed him off with the proverbial shilling and a oneway ticket to America."
625,And he finds himself thrown among people who would normally be cooking his meals or cleaning his boots.
626,What about the pretty girls?
627,They only make him uneasy.
628,"Oh, he can appreciate their beauty well enough, but in his world, don't you see, they'd be house maids or serving girls."
629,He wouldn't know how to treat them as equals.
630,He has all the arrogance of his class.
631,"Yes, but one can't help feeling sorry for him."
632,He must be desperately lonely.
633, How romantic you are.
634," No, am I?"
635,I think so.
636,Making up stories about people.
637,All you'd have to do is ask a deck steward.
638,They know everybody's business.
639,"Oh, I couldn't do that."
640,"Anyway, it helps pass the time."
641,One has to do something.
642,I believe I'm parboiled.
643,"Ten minutes more, dear."
644,Be brave.
645,"Mrs. brown, your time is up, lovey."
646,"Maude, you got an aspirin out there?"
647,"We'll see. Now, come along."
648,"Agh! I'm gonna take another halfhour, hon."
649, Whatever for?
650, For my sins!
651,"Hey, I'm looking for the swimming pool."
652," Yeah, me too."
653," Oh, good."
654,Jack thayer.
655,"Come along, come along."
656,"Hey, get a load of this."
657,My word.
658,Scheherazade.
659,I'll give you scheherazade.
660,Aren't you ashamed?
661,Just what is it you're after?
662,Could you tell us the way to the swimming pool...
663,The swimming bath is just there.
664,"And take a nice, cool shower right away!"
665,"You know, every time we've been in here, day or night, those four have been sitting in exactly the same place."
666,"I believe this ship could tip over, blow up, or run aground and not one of them would raise his eyes from his hand."
667,Play cards.
668,"Cognac, please."
669,"Can I buy you a drink, guggenheim?"
670, Why not?
671, Two.
672,Here. Try one of these.
673,Something special from Havana.
674,What a relief.
675,I seldom know these days exactly who is still speaking to me and who isn't.
676,Why wouldn't I be sympathetic?
677,Our stories aren't so very different.
678,Just a couple of middleaged refugees.
679, Refugees?
680," Fleeing from bad marriages, falling for younger women."
681,Condemned to wonder for the rest of our lives.
682,To wonder what?
683,"Do they really want us for ourselves, these golden girls, or is it just the name, the position, the money?"
684,I hate... getting old.
685,I hate having a paunch.
686,What about mine?
687,I love that.
688,I love you.
689,Do you love me?
690,Is it... is it possible you love me?
691,"We will be closing in five minutes' time, ladies and gentlemen."
692,Thank you.
693, Good night.
694, Good night.
695,"If I had a chaperone and a luxury suite with a sitting room, I'd invite you in for a chat."
696,"As it is, I'm sharing a cabin about this big with a total stranger."
697,I.
698, We'll see each other tomorrow.
699," I expect we will, yes."
700,"Well, it's inevitable."
701,See you at breakfast?
702,"I say, I don't know your name."
703, It's Leigh.
704, Miss Leigh or...
705,Miss goodwin. Leigh goodwin.
706,I'm Lawrence beesley.
707, I know.
708, How?
709,I asked a steward.
710,I told you they know everybody's business.
711, Longer.
712," Yes, a bit higher."
713,Thank you very much.
714,Would you care for a go?
715,I'm not allowed.
716, Who was that?
717, The lift boy.
718, The lift boy?
719, It mean he runs the elevator.
720,"I think he'd much rather be out here playing games, but he can't."
721,Thank youl!
722, It isn't fair.
723, What?
724,For anyone to be that beautiful.
725,"If you were to stand down there, there's a barrier between second and steerage."
726,You could talk to her when she came round.
727,No. You couldn't do that.
728,I'm sorry.
729,"All the arrogance of class isn't at the very top, you see."
730,It's none of my business in any case.
731,I was talking out of turn.
732,I honestly am sorry.
733, How's the patient?
734, Expiring.
735,"Ah, and what time's the rosary?"
736, Blackguards.
737, We missed you at lunch.
738,We brought you some fruit from the table.
739,"Don't, David. Don't ever say food to me again as long as I live."
740," Kate, fetch the chamber."
741," Now that's foolish, listen, you have nothing whatever on your stomach."
742,"It's a great pity, surely, to be lying there the whole voyage and you the grandest dancer from ballymahon to drumlish."
743, Me dancing days are over.
744, More's the pity.
745,For haven't we the fine figure of a lad in with us to be looking everywhere so for the right partner.
746,"My merry, kind, and true."
747,But I'll not forget my darling.
748,In the land I'm going to.
749,"Oh, they say there's bread and work for all."
750,And the sun shines always there.
751,But I'll not forget old Ireland.
752,"Is it true what the song says, oli, that there's bread and work for all on the other side?"
753,"Oh, for all who is willing to work, to work hard."
754,"Ja, I say so."
755,What you find naturally depends what you're looking for.
756,A bit of money more than anything.
757,Amen to that.
758," What about you, Martin?"
759, What?
760,"Give over, will you?"
761,"In my view, there's not a sorrier sight in the world than a man that's gone spoons over a girl he's never even spoken to."
762," Leave it alone, Farrell."
763," No, no, hear me out, boyo."
764,"I'm your friend, aren't I?"
765,Even if I've only known you a few days.
766,"And what I say, it's clear to everyone but you, that the lady is never going to honor us with her sublime presence again, having stuck her pretty nose in the one time only, and you'd be far better off if you..."
767,"You were saying, James?"
768,"Go in peace, my son."
769,And in your hour of rapture let it not be forgotten tomorrow's the first Sunday after easter.
770,"This is he that came by the water and blood, Jesus Christ."
771,"Not by water only, but by water and blood."
772,"Let us sing ""eternal father, strong to save."" Eternal father, strong to save."
773,Whose arm doth bind the restless wave.
774,Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep.
775,Its own appointed limits keep hear us when we cry to thee.
776,For those in peril on the sea.
777, What's all this in aid of?
778," Slumming, do you suppose?"
779, Steward?
780," Yes, madam, the captain always inspects the ship top to bottom every Sunday."
781,It's a white star tradition.
782,Isn't it the custom to have some sort of lifeboat drill on Sunday?
783," Yes, that's right."
784, Will there be one today?
785,I haven't heard of it.
786,"Well, isn't it rather important?"
787,I mean that everyone should know just which boat is assigned to where it is and so on?
788,"Normally I'd say yes, very important, but when you're talking about the Titanic, well, she's one great huge lifeboat herself, ain't she?"
789,Put me in my place.
790,Why would you think of lifeboats on a beautiful day like this?
791,I suppose one can't help speculating on the hazards this one puts out to sea.
792,"From my hotel in southampton the day we sailed, I was amazed at the conversations I overheard about famous marine disasters."
793,Everybody speculating how safe the Titanic really is.
794,You'll make me nervous in a minute.
795,I'm sorry.
796, Good morning.
797, Good morning.
798,Another perfect day.
799,You could scarcely ask for a smoother sea.
800,We've had a good few of those from various sources.
801,I suppose...
802," Well, how far away is this?"
803, Not far.
804,Chances are we'll be well into it by midnight.
805,Do you have any plans to alter the speed or course?
806,I never have in the past.
807,"The position, as you know, is the same with every large ship sailing this route."
808,"So long as the weather's clear and visibility good, full speed ahead."
809,Put the danger behind you as rapidly as possible.
810,I've lived by that and never encountered the slightest difficulty.
811,Had you anything in mind different for the Titanic?
812,Certainly not.
813,The company have always had utmost confidence in your judgment.
814,"And of course, we should be sorry not to arrive in New York on schedule."
815,Please carry on as if I weren't even on board.
816,It's about time.
817,"Thank you, Alfie."
818,"Have you filled out a declaration form for the American customs yet, sir?"
819,"No, not yet."
820,New York still seems such a long way off.
821,"Well, might as well be early as late."
822,"The way they're pouring on the steam, the chances are that we will dock on Tuesday, late Tuesday rather than Wednesday morning."
823,"In that event, tonight seems likely to be our last night but one."
824,Good heavens.
825,Dinner!
826,No reaction.
827,They must have their meals sent in.
828, Are we dressing again?
829, Of course we're dressing.
830,Every night except the first and the last.
831, But why?
832, How do I know why?
833,"It's the unwritten law of the sea, that's why."
834,Moses gave it to Noah and he took it from there.
835,Wouldn't the schuberts love this staircase?
836,Only if they could get it for half price.
837,Lina abarbanell in madame Sherry.
838,Every little movement has a meaning of its own.
839,Every thought and feeling by some posture can be shown.
840,And every...
841,Rene!
842,Kettle is almost boiling.
843,"Oh, I could do with a cup."
844,The bell in my station hasn't stopped ringing since dawn.
845,Never mind it's Sunday.
846,Is that the frock Mrs. astor promised you?
847,"This, my girl, is the Paris gown."
848,Mrs. brown is wearing to the gala dinner tonight.
849,"She's decided it's a bit plain for her taste, and she wants me to tart it up with this."
850,There's a needle and thread over here.
851,Hang on a minute.
852,"Poor creature, is she in pain, doctor?"
853,She was. I gave her something.
854,Whether or not she took it is anybody's guess.
855,"She's an independent little thing, though."
856,Apparently.
857,"If everyone wants to cheer, why don't they?"
858,Because we're all so frightfully proper.
859,"Says who? Dag blame it, give her a hand!"
860,That's the biggest thing that's happened.
861,"Take a bow, kid, you're a celebrity."
862,What do you have to break to get a standing ovation?
863,Very nice indeed.
864,Oh my gosh.
865,Mesaba to Titanic.
866,Ice report in latitude...
867,"Heavy packed ice, large icebergs also."
868,Field ice. Weather good. Clear.
869,I'll be damned if I'm gonna break my neck running up to the bridge again.
870,It's only more of the same.
871,"Sorry, Jack, just polishing the old ivories."
872, What did you say?
873, Nothing.
874, It's a raw night.
875, Perishing cold.
876,Temperature's dropped four degrees in the past halfhour.
877, There's not much wind.
878," No, flat calm."
879,"Aye, seems clear enough."
880,Perfectly clear.
881,We're doing just over 22 knots at present.
882,Not bad for a 21knot ship.
883,He said if it becomes the least bit hazy we'll be obliged to slow down.
884,I understand.
885,His order is that he's to be woken up at once if there's any noticeable change.
886, Right you are.
887," I'll leave you to it, then."
888, Good night.
889, Good night.
890,"All right, you lot, out you come."
891,What's the word?
892,Keep a sharp lookout for small ice.
893, Have you seen any?
894, Nah.
895,But it's out there.
896,I can smell it.
897,"Have fun, chaps."
898,You want to hear something funny?
899,Everyone on the dancefloor is on his honeymoon.
900,"And like us, they can't believe it's over."
901,We still have tomorrow.
902,I don't want it ever to end.
903,I want to go on sailing and dancing and loving forever and ever.
904,I am too old to be cavorting around the dancefloor with a girl half my age.
905,Especially when the girl is a bit pregnant.
906,Especially that.
907,I really shouldn't ask you.
908,"No, you shouldn't, but I'd never forgive you if you didn't."
909,Anything wrong?
910,Why don't you find something else?
911,"There's always ""hopalong Cassidy""."
912,I can't concentrate.
913,I keep thinking how near the end we are.
914,Oughtn't we be doing something special tonight?
915, Like what?
916, It don't know.
917,"There's some sort of concert in the lounge, I believe."
918,"Yes, I saw the announcement."
919,"""The flight of the Bumblebee"" and other favorites on piano and violin."
920, Would you care to go?
921, Would you?
922, Not really.
923, Neither would I.
924,It's probably over by now anyway.
925,Very likely.
926,What else is there?
927,A turn on the deck?
928,Why not?
929,There I am 30 or 40 years on.
930,A friend of mine once said that I'd take my nose out of a book one day and find that life had passed me by.
931,Is this too cold for you?
932," No, I like it."
933, You sure?
934,"Let's keep moving though, it is bracing."
935,To say the least.
936,Go on about your friend.
937, Diana.
938, Was that her name?
939,Yes.
940,She was very critical of my nature.
941,She said I was the carefullest man she ever met.
942,"According to her, by the time I ever get around to doing a thing, having weighed every possible consequence, it's usually too late."
943,I ought to have invited you to that concert after dinner.
944,"Why, when neither of us cared anything about it?"
945,It would have made a change.
946,Something at least a little bit festive.
947,If we were first class we might have gone dancing.
948,"Yes. On the boat coming over, some of the more daring young folk in second sneaked up and had quite a gay time of it apparently."
949,You didn't go?
950,"No, I was afraid of the embarrassment if I were caught."
951,I should be too.
952, We're both cautious.
953, Yes.
954,"A turn on the deck won't be much to look back on, will it?"
955,Not very memorable.
956,Why not? It's a beautiful night.
957,I don't think I've ever seen so many stars all at one time.
958,"Amazing, isn't it?"
959,"So bright up there, so dark below."
960,"The sea doesn't reflect the stars, have you noticed?"
961,"Like a big black void, bottomless."
962,"I think this is much nicer than dancing or listening to ""the flight of the Bumblebee."" You're wrong to say that tonight won't be anything to look back on."
963,I'm sure I'll remember it for a very long time.
964,Will you?
965,Yes.
966,It was awfully lucky for me that we met.
967, That I was so forward you mean?
968," Yes, well, there you are, you see, if you hadn't been, I'd never have spoken for fear you might think me a masher or something."
969,I could never do that.
970,It's obvious to everyone what sort of a man you are.
971,"You know, when you left the boat deck this afternoon, the woman that was sitting next to me leaned over and said, ""your husband is a perfect gentleman.""  ""Your husband""?"
972, Isn't it silly?
973,It appears our spending so much time together has aroused quite a lot of interest.
974,"My cabin steward, for one."
975,Did he say something?
976,Yes.
977,He's a very friendly sort of chap.
978,I expect he meant well.
979,"""It must be hard with so many people milling around to find a place to be alone.â And?"
980,That was all.
981,Doesn't sound as if it were.
982,It had the ring of an unfinished thought.
983,And then he said something stupid  I couldn't possibly repeat.
984," Well, you'll have to now or I'll think it's something awful if you don't."
985, It is awful.
986, Go on.
987,"He said... we were talking just outside my door, he said..."
988,"""There's an empty cabin at the far end of the corridor."" I see."
989,Did he give you a key?
990,"There is no key, it's unlocked."
991,Do you want me to go there with you?
992,"I expect I do, yes."
993,"Oh, you expect but you're not certain."
994,You haven't weighed every possible consequence.
995,I scarcely dared think about it.
996,Then how can you be sure it's what you really want?
997,"Not just what you think I might expect from you, the friendly thing to do."
998,"Because we are friends, I believe, or at least good companions."
999,Of course.
1000,"But we're not in love, are we?"
1001,Well?
1002,Are we?
1003,"No, I don't expect we are."
1004,Of course not.
1005,"Either way, I'm told the same rule applies."
1006,"Shipboard friendships, like shipboard romances end with the voyage."
1007,It's considered bad form to pursue it any further.
1008,You sound as if you're already saying goodbye.
1009,No.
1010,Just practicing.
1011,"I will say good night, though, if you don't mind."
1012,I really am feeling the cold finally.
1013,I'm sorry.
1014,I'll see you to your door.
1015,"No, don't. Stay. Have your walk."
1016,I'm all right.
1017,Please. Please.
1018,Forget what I said.
1019,It was clumsy and foolish.
1020, I don't know what possessed me.
1021, I think I do.
1022,"I think it was just a desire, a desire to be kind."
1023,"I'm not offended, honestly."
1024,"A little shocked, perhaps, but not offended."
1025,"I suppose I actually ought to be grateful, and I am in a way, it's just that..."
1026,"Forgive me, but I'm waiting for a better offer."
1027,So you should.
1028,"Thank you all the same, you're a very special man."
1029,I'll never forget you.
1030, Good night.
1031, You're sure I can't...
1032,Good night.
1033,"Look at the flowers, all bloody withered."
1034,"Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloodywell dead?"
1035,"Let's not have a sniffle, let's have a bloodygood cry."
1036,And always remember the longer you live.
1037,The sooner you'll bloodywell die.
1038,"Look at the preacher, a bloodynice fellow."
1039,"Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloodywell dead?"
1040,"Let's not have a sniffle, let's have a bloodygood cry."
1041,And always remember the longer you live.
1042,The sooner you'll bloodywell die.
1043,"Come on, boys, no more cold mutton."
1044,There's fresh meat for tomorrow's feast.
1045,Tally ho!
1046,"Come on, paddy, start collecting the groceries."
1047,I don't fancy that.
1048,"All right, now..."
1049,Christ.
1050,What did you see?
1051, Iceberg right ahead.
1052, Thank you.
1053,Iceberg right ahead.
1054,Hard to starboard.
1055,We've had it.
1056,Hello.
1057,"How did you ever get down there, Seamus?"
1058,"You tell me, ya jibber."
1059,Did you feel something?
1060," I did, a slight bump."
1061, A bump in midocean?
1062,Steward.
1063, Why have we stopped?
1064," I don't know, sir."
1065,But I don't suppose it's anything much.
1066,"Mr. Barrett, where's the man got to?"
1067,"Barrett, get some men down there to help draw the fires."
1068," Aye aye, sir."
1069, Go!
1070,Just how serious is it?
1071,We're listing five points to starboard.
1072,"Oh, my god."
1073,What are you doing about it?
1074,"At the moment, I'm waiting for a report from Mr. Andrews and the chief engineer as to the exact extent of the damage."
1075,"Fire down below, fire down below!"
1076,You want to get blown to kingdom come?
1077,I don't want to see your faces you back here until these boilers are out!
1078,"Is it hopeless, then?"
1079,It appears that the unthinkable has happened.
1080,"As you know, the ship is designed to stay afloat with any three of its first five compartments flooded."
1081,"She would even float if all five were gone, torn away completely, but under no circumstances can she be expected remain afloat with those five compartments flooded."
1082,The sheer weight of the flooding must inevitably bring her down at the head.
1083,Every sort of potential damage was considered in the planning.
1084,But who could have anticipated a collision that would leave a gash close to 300 feet long in her side?
1085,"The pumps will help, of course."
1086,Temporarily.
1087,How much time do you give us?
1088,"At a rough guess, one hour, possibly two."
1089,Gentlemen.
1090,"I must say something to you now, which you can well appreciate is the nightmare of every master and which, in 32 years of service to this company, I never expected to have to say."
1091,We must prepare to abandon ship.
1092,"Mr. wilde and Mr. lightoller, cover the boats."
1093,"Mr. Murdoch, muster the passengers."
1094, What is that?
1095, Steam coming off the boilers.
1096, Can't you stop it?
1097," We've got to let off steam, sir, the engine will explode otherwise."
1098,"Mr. boxhall, tell the wireless operator to send out the distress signal, he must be given our position."
1099,Cap.
1100,There must not be any panic.
1101,"Well, get on with it."
1102,"Lad, here, help me over here."
1103,Get started on number three.
1104,"Sir, a ship has been sighted half a point on the port bow."
1105,"At least a light, there might be a ship."
1106,Request permission to break out the rockets.
1107,By all means use your morse lamp as well.
1108,The carpathia is on her way to us but she's more than 50 miles away.
1109,"Tell her, if you make contact, to come quickly."
1110,"Aye aye, sir."
1111,"Stop it now, Jimmy!"
1112,Say what you want.
1113,"I'll make a snowman of ya, see if I don't."
1114, Take that.
1115, Come here.
1116,"Stop it, stop it, stop it, no, stop it, stop it!"
1117, Stop it!
1118, Jimmy.
1119,"Listen, listen, if you have anything in the cabin you value, you better come quickly."
1120,"There's water on the floor and so help me, it's rising."
1121,All passengers on deck with their lifebelts on.
1122, What happened?
1123," Oh, no cause for alarm, madam."
1124,There's been some mishap and we've been asked to take certain precautions.
1125,"It's all right, go back to bed."
1126,"Oh, do go back to bed, won't you."
1127,"That's right, there's nothing whatever to worry about."
1128,"Nothing, nothing at all, just go back to bed."
1129,"Dear, what are you telling them, the order is for everyone  to get into their lifebelts."
1130, First I've heard of it.
1131," Yeah, well, now you know."
1132," Then what,  take them up on the boat deck?"
1133," No, of course not you know it's all first and second class up there."
1134,They won't stay in the cabins once they put the belts on.
1135,"Then there's something, some concern."
1136,"I know, but we'll just have to herd them into the general room, I suppose, and in the foyers."
1137,"Listen, we don't want any unpleasantness."
1138, Just keep them calm.
1139, Understand.
1140,"Ah, look at that, will you?"
1141,Mother's picture.
1142,"What's that steward on about, there's no lifebelts under here."
1143,None up here either.
1144,We've been fiddled.
1145,"You see, darling."
1146,That is what makes it float.
1147,"Do you think you ought to be doing that, Johnny?"
1148, Why not?
1149, Perhaps you'll need it.
1150,I'm sure they have more than enough.
1151,There were half a dozen in our suite.
1152,It's nonsense for us to be in these things anyway.
1153,This ship is unsinkable.
1154,It's just not a publicity slogan.
1155,It's a scientific fact.
1156,"All I say is, tell us what's expected of us and we'll do it."
1157,It's this not knowing that makes everybody so edgy.
1158,Look who's here.
1159,"Good business, Wally."
1160,Miss goodwin.
1161,Mr. hesketh.
1162,Are all the fires out in number six?
1163, Aye.
1164, What about number five?
1165,"Flooded, completely covered with water."
1166,"Well let's get going, then."
1167,"No lifebelt, miss Sloan?"
1168,It seemed a bit mean to wear one.
1169,Apparently they're in short supply.
1170,"Now, don't be a fool, there are plenty."
1171,Find one and put it on straight away.
1172,"Yes, sir."
1173,"Oh, and what about you?"
1174,"The boats are ready, don't you think it's time we got  the women and children away?"
1175," Without any delay, the assignment list is no good to us now, it's too late to organize it in properly."
1176,Just do the best you can as quickly as possible.
1177,Sir.
1178,"Ladies, ladies, please, we're trying to fill this boat."
1179,We can't do that without your...
1180,Cooperation.
1181, What means that?
1182, It means the fires are all out.
1183,It means the boilers are cold.
1184,"It means the Titanic isn't going anywhere under its own steam, you'll be just as well off in this boat."
1185,"No, it's not safe, nol, I want to go back to my cabin."
1186, My jewels!
1187," Don't be a damn fool, honey."
1188,They won't be any use to you if this thing sinks.
1189,"Now go ahead, do as the man says."
1190,"Come on, love, we won't drop you."
1191, You too.
1192," Oh, hold on a minute, no."
1193,I just thought I'd stick around for a while and watch the fun.
1194,My friend!
1195,"Down here, Emma, jump in."
1196,It's all right.
1197,"I'll get the next one, Maggie."
1198,"Molly, it's Molly, can't you ever get it right?"
1199,"If, by any chance, I am not on the list of survivors, tell my wife that the last time you saw me I was wearing my english dinner jacket, I was prepared to die like a gentleman."
1200,It'll make a nice story for her to tell her friends.
1201,"Now, lower away."
1202,"Women and children only, women and children only."
1203,"I can't force the women in, can I?"
1204,I can't hit them in the head if they don't want to go.
1205,"Ladies, this way, please, this way."
1206,What's going on?
1207,I'll put a stop to that.
1208,"Right, lower away."
1209,"Lower away, lower away!"
1210,"Lower away, lower away."
1211,"Well, don't take all night, come on, boys, lower away!"
1212,"Put some life into it, faster."
1213,"Listen, mister, you get the hell out and it will go fine."
1214, I only wanted to help.
1215," Oh, you want it faster, do you?"
1216,You'll have me drown the lot of them.
1217,"Who the bloody hell are you, anyway to be giving orders?"
1218,"Now, look here, I'm..."
1219,Do you know who I am?
1220,"I... I'm... I'm a passenger, I'm a passenger."
1221,"Well, then get back with the passengers and leave the crew to do their job."
1222,I'm sorry.
1223," Oh no, let's take the elevator."
1224, It's only one flight.
1225, Something's funny.
1226, What do you mean?
1227," The steps, don't you feel it?"
1228, Yeah they make you  lean forward.
1229," They're tilted, they're tilted toward the front of the ship, now what would cause that?"
1230,Search me.
1231,I didn't know it was a party.
1232,Don't look so worried.
1233,"They'll keep you out there until they got everything shipshape again, then they'll bring you back on board."
1234,"Look here, look here, my wife is expecting."
1235, May I get in just long...
1236," I wouldn't advise it, sir."
1237,The chief officer is getting rather touchy at this point.
1238,He's even given us all pistols just in case.
1239,"Well, I wouldn't want to get shot, thank you."
1240,Please be extra careful with this lady.
1241,Johnny.
1242,"Soon, darling."
1243,Soon.
1244,Lower away.
1245,"We'll be together soon, darling."
1246,"Now, listen, everybody!"
1247,"Listen now, pay attention, please."
1248,Now listen.
1249,"Look, I've been authorized to lead you all out in small groups to where the lifeboats are."
1250,"Now, the rule is women and children first, of course."
1251,"That'll take from Jericho till June, I'm thinking."
1252,"Come on, we'll have our own small group."
1253,Come on.
1254,"Don't push forward, ladies, come this way."
1255,Nobody come down.
1256,"Men, stay back."
1257,Women and children only.
1258,"I say, Mary Agatha, may I have this dance?"
1259,"No two ways about it, this is the best shipwreck I've ever been to in my whole life."
1260,"Funny, is it, you'll be waltzing with sharks if we can't get up to where the music is."
1261,"Now, come on."
1262,"What's your answer to that, oli, you with them powerful great mitts of yours?"
1263,Well said.
1264,Katie.
1265," Oh, Kate."
1266," Will you look at that, now!"
1267,Did you ever.
1268,Real silver.
1269,Real linen.
1270,"If what they say about the states is true, it's the way we'll all living before long."
1271,Picking up gold and silver from Tom tiddler's ground.
1272,"Come on, will you?"
1273,"What's this, what's this, how did you lot get here?"
1274,"I see, that's your game, is it?"
1275,"Let me tell you, it'll go on with the lot of you if anything is missing from this room tomorrow."
1276,"Furthermore, every firstclass state room has been carefully locked in case you get any ideas."
1277,We'll have no looting aboard this ship while I'm master arms.
1278,"Looting, is it?"
1279,We don't know anything about any looting.
1280,T'was only looking we were.
1281,Looking for a way to the lifeboats.
1282,Do you go through here?
1283,Where I go doesn't come into it.
1284,You go back the way you came and be quick about it.
1285,You're not meant to be in here and well you know it.
1286,"For god's sake, mister, let the women through at least."
1287,"Well, it's against the rules."
1288,"All right, women only, though."
1289," Danny, please."
1290, It's all right.
1291,I love you.
1292," You go ahead, Ellen."
1293, But Mr. straus said...
1294,"Don't worry, I'll explain to him."
1295,He won't like it.
1296,He's put up with me for 40 years.
1297,What can he do to me now?
1298,Don't be angry.
1299,"And please don't argue, my mind's made up."
1300,I'm going to stay with you for a little.
1301,How long is a little?
1302,We'll see.
1303,We'll see.
1304,"Right, lower away."
1305, Murdoch.
1306, Sir.
1307,"How many boats left over here, Mr. Murdoch?"
1308," Two, sir."
1309, Two?
1310,Make sure that they're filled to absolute capacity.
1311,"Yes, sir."
1312,Let the children through.
1313,Kindly let them through.
1314,"Hurry along, that's right."
1315,We don't want to send another boat away halfempty.
1316,Any more women?
1317,"Any more women, please."
1318,"Come on, ladies, this is the last boat but one on this side."
1319,You can't afford to pick and choose.
1320,"See you soon, kid."
1321,You better!
1322, I don't suppose...
1323," Just hand them over, sir."
1324,"Their mother is not here, you see."
1325, They have only me.
1326, They'll be well looked after.
1327,"Right, that's it, lower away."
1328, Papa!
1329, Papa!
1330,"Papa, papa!"
1331,Papa! Papa!
1332,"Hey, hey, any women behind you?"
1333, No.
1334," Come on, there's a space here."
1335,Jump.
1336, Jump.
1337, Come on.
1338,Jump!
1339,Now!
1340," Come on, give me your hand."
1341, Thank you.
1342,Steady.
1343,Lift!
1344,"Okay, we've got you."
1345,Lift.
1346, You all right?
1347," Yes, thanks, thanks very much."
1348, What you got there?
1349, A dressing gown.
1350,"A dressing gown, what do you want to bring that for?"
1351,I don't know.
1352, I don't know.
1353," You've got a screw loose somewhere, haven't ya, mate?"
1354,Let go of that!
1355, It's jammed!
1356," God almighty,  that comes down on top of us."
1357, Cut this right underneath.
1358,"Cut that bloody rope, man, we're trapped."
1359,Stop lowering 15.
1360,Stop lowering 15!
1361,"Bloody rope, we're trapped."
1362,Stop lowering!
1363,"All right, love, come along."
1364,"Steady it, steady, someone pull that boat in."
1365,Step over there.
1366,Watch your skirt.
1367,Well done.
1368,"You'll be fine, dear."
1369,"All right, next."
1370,Next.
1371,Give me your hand.
1372,That's it.
1373,"Come along, dear, come along."
1374,"Steady, steady as you go."
1375,For heaven's sake.
1376,Shh!
1377,Daniel.
1378,"Here, cover yourself with this."
1379,"Now, keep back."
1380,"Come on, come on with the others."
1381,Good.
1382,"Come on, boys, follow me."
1383,This is the way to the lifeboats.
1384,Come on.
1385,Which way do we go?
1386, Mr. Murdoch.
1387, Keep it moving.
1388, Mr. Murdoch!
1389, Get 'em back!
1390,"There's none of that, now stay back, stay well back."
1391,"Any man who tries to push his way in he don't get arrested, he gets this for his bother."
1392,Any more women there?
1393,Are there no more women about?
1394,Come on if you're there.
1395,This may be your last chance.
1396,Lower away.
1397,Are there any ladies or children?
1398,Mr. Andrews.
1399,All the boats are away now except for one or two of the collapsible kind.
1400,"Better hurry then, you don't want to be left behind."
1401,"No use, sir."
1402,"Get going, miss Sloan."
1403,"Yes, sir."
1404,"There's nothing for it, I'm afraid."
1405,Better hurry.
1406,"You must save yourself, you know."
1407,There'll be questions no one else will ever be able to answer.
1408,"Possibly, possibly, it's something to consider."
1409,Don't be too long.
1410,"No, no, not too long."
1411,Off you go.
1412,"Mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen."
1413,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1414,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen."
1415,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1416,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death amen."
1417,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1418,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death amen."
1419,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1420,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death amen."
1421,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1422,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death amen."
1423,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee..."
1424,"They ain't just forgotten about us, have they, bootsy?"
1425,"You're not off there mate, us and a right few others."
1426,God knows how many trapped below deck.
1427, What we going to do then?
1428, You a catholic?
1429, No.
1430," Me neither, what's it matter now, come on."
1431,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death amen."
1432,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1433, I'm for jumping.
1434, I'm for sliding down.
1435,You might land on a deck chair or something and hurt yourself.
1436,"Yeah, you might get pulled under by the suction."
1437,"Well, we'll see who's right."
1438,"See you in New York, maybe."
1439,Nice meeting you.
1440,"It's locked, it's locked."
1441,"There's no way out here, go back."
1442,"Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day..."
1443,"Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."
1444,And lead us not to temptation...
1445,"Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."
1446,"Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen."
1447,"Hail Mary, full of grace..."
1448,"Get moving, come on!"
1449,"Move it, come on, move!"
1450,Now over the side!
1451,We may be able to load it in the water!
1452,"But deliver us from evil, amen."
1453,Martin!
1454,Don't look.
1455,"Over herel get over herel Move, move!"
1456,Help me!
1457,Help!
1458,Help!
1459,Help!
1460,Mind that oar there.
1461,Sorry.
1462,Come on.
1463,Help!
1464,Come onl Grab the rope.
1465,Help!
1466,Help me!
1467,Help!
1468,Help!
1469,Help me!
1470,She's gone.
1471,God almighty.
1472,We got to go back.
1473, We got to go back and help!
1474, Like hell we will.
1475,They'd only tip us over.
1476,They'd pull us down.
1477,Give me the tiller.
1478,You take over an oar for a change.
1479,"Look, I'm in charge here."
1480,"Now sit down and row, sit down, damn you!"
1481, You're talking to a lady.
1482, I know who I'm talking to.
1483,Coward.
1484,Coward.
1485,There's nothing more we can do for them!
1486,We took all we could out of the water.
1487,We'll get swamped if we go back.
1488,What's the use in any more dying?
1489,That's no help to anyone.
1490,"Come on, Emma, come on."
1491,"Come on, Emma."
1492,What I notice more than anything else is the silence.
1493,I suppose I expected sobbing or screaming or I don't know.
1494,Everyone's so quiet.
1495,Perhaps it hasn't hit them yet.
1496,I know it hasn't hit me.
1497,Perhaps they're still hearing that sound.
1498,I know I'll never stop hearing it.
1499,And I keep looking for certain faces.
1500, The sad librarian.
1501, Ti know.
1502,I did so hope little Alfie might have come through.
1503,The lift boy.
1504,"It was his first voyage, he loved the sea."
1505,Rumor has it that Mr. ismay is in shock and they've got him under sedation.
1506,"He supposed to have said to somebody, ""I have no right to be alive."
1507,"Women and children are dead."" You can't feel guilty to be alive."
1508,You didn't plow that ship full speed through an icefield you knew was there in the dead of night.
1509,Or let it sail with thousands of people on board and only enough lifeboats for a few hundred.
1510,Who lays down the law about a thing like that anyway?
1511,British board of trade.
1512,"Well, then let the British board of trade feel guilty."
1513,"Of course they'll have some routine lull inquiry and give themselves a nice, soothing coat of whitewash."
1514,Nothing will have changed.
1515,Everything will go on just exactly as it was.
1516,Not everything.
1517,What about us?
1518,Shall we ever be the same again?
1519,I wonder.
1520,Shall we ever be able to look at the world in quite the same way?
1521,"I'll never see it as safe and snug, if that's what you mean."
1522,None of us will.
1523,"They never did, of course."
1524,For them it's always been perilous and unjust.
1525,"In a way, one might almost envy them the fact they have no illusions to be disabused of."
1526,But they...
1527,"I should think they, especially, have had a shocking glimpse of the underside of things."
1528,The Titanic was a way of life designed especially for them.
1529,"Safe, snug, and teeming with creature comforts."
1530,And it's crumbled under them.
1531,"Good afternoon, ladies, I'm Mrs. ogden from New York."
1532,"I'm just one of the passengers on the carpathia trying to do my bit, I've got hot coffee here and sandwiches, huh?"
1533,"Oh, now, come on."
1534,You've got to have some nourishment after all.
1535,"Come on, dear, you set them an example."
1536,Please don't do that.
1537,"Just give it to somebody else, won't you please."
1538,Every one of these ladies has just lost her husband.
1539,"I know that, son."
1540,I know how I'd feel in their place.
1541,"And believe me, my heart goes out to you, all of you."
1542,But you've got to go on living.
1543,You just have to say to yourself it was god's will.
1544,"Whatever you do, you must never lose faith in the infinite wisdom and mercy of the lord."
1545," Coffee, hm?"
1546, No coffee.
1547,No god either.
1548,God went down with the Titanic.
