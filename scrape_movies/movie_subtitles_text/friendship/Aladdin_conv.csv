339," Vizir, it's because of Aladinde that you are there?"
340," That's where I'll end my life,  as  other guys finished it."
341, I have a lot of admiration for you.
342, How nice.
343, It is true. The number of people that you made suffer ...
344, I did not count.
345,We know each other ?

396, It's unbearable.
397," Wait. As you know, I was sentenced to 1400 years in prison."
398,So I appealed and I took over 500 years.

473, I left a little fast from the palace.
474,I forgot my papers.
475, You're not serious ?
476, Do you still have your ID?
477," Permanently, brother!"

872,here this magnificent lamp.
873,This is an opportunity like there is not one.
874,It is still under warranty.
875, She is small.
876, Little but strong !
877,"As it is the last, I make a friend price."

886, I can not accept.
887, It is necessary !
888,With the heart.
889, It is true ?
890,It's not because you're scared that I kill you?
891," No, I'm not scared!"
892,I am not afraid at all!
893," Then, I accept!"
894,Tell me...
895,How it works ?
896, It must be polished gently with the thumb.
897, I polish him ...
898,I polish it ...
899,"Magic music  Wow, there are only guys here!"
900," prostrate in front of the great Shah Zaman, your new master."
901," I bow down to you, big Shah Zaman."
902, It's not me.
903," I bow down to you, big Shah Zaman."
904, No it is not me.
905, Who is it?
906, It's him.
907,"  That,  he's a genius?"
908, Yes Boss.
909," It made me feel good, this reboot."
910,âª should have done it sooner.
911, Yeah ...
912,So here we are in Baghdad?
913,They changed the decor.
914, Yes. And the temperature.
915, What are you doing at home?
916, We did not know it was your home.
917,You are ?
918, Snow Queen.
919, Sorry.
920,"Snow Queen, we know it."
921,She is called the queen of ...
922, Shut up !
923," Oh, stop!"
924,"Madam, do not do that."
925, Who allowed you to enter in my forbidden palace?
926, We did not know it was forbidden.
927,"We go to Baghdad to free, finally, deliver ..."
928," Wait, what did you say?"
929," We're going to Baghdad to free, finally, deliver ..."
930," To release, to deliver ..."

945,She continues to sing.
946, No no no !
947, Its good.
948,What happened to you ?
949, Can I submit you amber musks?
950, I love the amber muse!
951, Ah! There you are !
952," Master, if you knew how it's done good to find my legs."
953,Thank you.
954, I want my wishes.
955,"I want that when Aladinde returns to Baghdad, you kill him."
956," Oh yeah, no."
957,Sorry I can not do that.
958,I can not kill a human as a genius.
959,I am only love.
960,I am only kisses.
961,I want...
962,that Princess Shallia love me illico pesto.
963," That too, I can not do it."
964,A genius can not make lovers.
965," If you do not arrive to fulfill my wishes, it's because you have no powers."
966,That's all.
967, I have no powers?
968,"Me, I have no powers?"
969,"Master, you are wrong."
970, Akinator?
971," You, you are wrong."

990, No I do not want to.
991, That's it ?
992, I do not want to go back.
993,"I can not force a woman to fall in love, but I can help you seduce her."
994, That is to say ?
995, You know that I am an expert in seduction.

1030,"""Yes, I said no."
1031," You said no, I had dinner ..."
1032, We'll move.
1033," Put your legs, they look at us chelous."
1034, See you.

1041, Who is this?
1042, A friend who comes from the Yvelines to see me.
1043,"Princess, I summoned you to inform you that I'm organizing a charity ball."
1044,"As my company dislikes you, I will go with my friend."
1045, Ok good. That's all ?
1046, That's all.
1047,Oh!
1048,What did she say?
1049, No nothing. Nonsense.
1050,You're funny.
1051," Otherwise, I said to myself, about the ball ..."
1052,It might be better to go with a princess rather than with a girl say ... ordinary.
1053,"Let's say I did not think about it, that's right."
1054,After all why not ?
1055, Wait.
1056,I did not understand.
1057,Who is ordinary?
1058, Sorry.
1059,I meant rather vulgar.
1060, What did you say ? I'm going to fuck you.
1061, No !

1063," Girls, girls, girls ..."
1064," Did you hear it, Pocahontas?"
1065,She says I'm vulgar.
1066, But you're not vulgar.
1067,"You are beautiful, you are distinguished, you are divine."
1068, Do you take his defense?
1069, Noâ¦  You have found yourself well.

1079,What did we say?
1080, I saw you with the other!
1081,You looked at me even more!
1082,What am I to you ? A kleenex we use and throw?
1083,You're wrong girl!
1084,I'm not that one.
1085,You know who I am ? A gogetter!
1086,I am a girl who advances in life.
1087,A girl who does not control her emotions.
1088,I am a fighter.

1113,You have discovered America.
1114," It's you, though technically, we were there before."
