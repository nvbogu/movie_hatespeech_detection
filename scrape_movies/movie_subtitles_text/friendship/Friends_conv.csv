50,Oh... it's a work in progress.
51," You've been tinkering,  haven't you?"
52, It helps me to think.
53,  Right.

144,Go put it back in the car.
145,But what if somebody breaks into the car and steals it?
146,Then all my stuff is gone.
147,"Noah, please, go put it back in the car."
148, We don't have time for this.
149, You never have time  and you work at Time Labs.
150, Guys!
151,It's just a backpack.
152,Can I see what's inside of it?
153,Â¶Â¶ You're all good.
154,"You just have a good night, all right?"
155,"Thank you, Larry."
156,The key is to stick to the right side of the cave under the rock overhang.
157,Otherwise the fire will get you every time.
158,"Hey, thanks, kid."
159,Hey! How'd you know that's where I was getting tripped up at?
160,Everyone suffers in that cave.
161,You're barely here and you're already helping people.

179," I knew if anybody could  figure this data out,  it'd be you."
180,"No problem, Mr. Zaurin."
181,"Um, honestly, it's been a while since I've been in the building after 6:00 p.m."
182," Quiet, isn't it?"
183, It is that.
184," Zaurin chuckles  So let's go over these specs,  try to figure this thing out."
185,Sure thing.
186,Ready when you are.

192, Loud and clear.
193,"Â¶Â¶ If anybody's in here, you better come out right now!"
194,That's right.
195,"If there's anybody playing around in here, we're not the guys to be messing with."

197,Let's go get some waffles.
198,My treat.
199, Sounds great.
200, footsteps echo relieved sigh You really ought to buy.
201,I got you off the hook with my brotherinlaw.
202,"Yeah, your brotherinlaw didn't pay me enough to buy you waffles."
203,Â¶Â¶ You're heavier than you look.
204,I can't believe they were gonna throw you away.
205,"Once this compiles, the server should come back online immediately."
206,"Zaurin I knew we could  count on you, Peter."
207, I owe you lunch next week.
208,Great.
209,I was glad to help and I will look forward to that lunch.
210," Thank you, sir."
211,  Goodbye.
212,Hey.
213,"We're still on for doughnuts, right?"
214,Yeah.
215,I'm sorry about the detour.
216,You wanna finish watching our movie together?
217,"Um, it's getting a little late."
218,I should probably get started on some homework.
219,sighs  Raincheck?
220, Yeah.
221,microwave beeps and starts Â¶Â¶ buzzing crackling Â¶Â¶ So you got yourself a really expensivelooking toy robot?
222, Aren't you a little old  for that?
223, Cute.
224,  I know.
225,"Look, Bethany, whatever it is, it's not a toy."
226,Why do you say that?
227,'Cause it's heavy!
228, Maybe you just need  to work out more.
229,The app on my phone says I move at least two miles a day.
230,Where'd you get it?
231,"Uh, somebody was going to throw it out."
232, Somebody was  throwing that out?
233,"  Crazy, right?"
234, Yeah.
235,"So, like, you just dragged this thing back to your house?"
236,"No, I I put it in my backpack."
237," Oh, man!"
238,  What does it do?
239,Huh?
240, Does it do anything?
241,  I don't know.
242,That's what I'm trying to find out.
243,I can't even figure out how to turn it on.
244,Maybe that's why it was rejected.
245,"I mean, nobody wants a toy that doesn't work."
246,"I'm telling you, it's it's not a toy and it's not a reject."
247,sighs Not anymore.
248,Okay.
249,How about I come over tomorrow and take a look at it with you?
250,If you want to.
251,I could really use your expertise.
252,"Yeah. Yeah, of course I want to."
253,Just promise me one thing.
254,What?
255,"Don't tell anyone else about this, okay?"
256,Why?
257,I just think it would be better if it was a secret.
258,What aren't you telling me?
259,"I just think if only you and I You stole it, didn't you?"
260,"nervous laugh ""Stole""?"
261,That's a strong word.
262,"I'm telling you, they were going to throw it away."
263,Who?
264,"Where'd you get it, Noah?"
265,"Uh, it was in the crush pile."
266,Uhhuh...
267,In a vault.
268,Yeah...
269,At Time Labs.
270, What?!
271,  Shh!
272, Keep your voice down!
273, You stole a robot from Time Labs?
274,"I'm telling you , they were going to throw it away."
275,I didn't know you had it in you!
276,What are you doing?
277,sighs I can't find  my socket wrench.
278,Mark probably took it to fix his stupid skateboard.
279,"knocking Peter Hey, Noah?"
280,"It's getting late, buddy."
281,Time to go to bed.
282,"Okay, Dad."
283,Do you still wanna come over tomorrow?
284,Are you kidding me?
285,I have to see this thing in person!
286,But don't turn it on without me.
287,I'll see you then.
288,"Okay, good night."
289,sighs clatter Just put it back when you're done.
290,Is that too much to ask?
291,"boy Hey, come on!"
292,Let's go.
293, We gotta get out of here.
294,Come on!
295, boy 2 Let's go!
296," Come on, let's go!"
297, Yeah!
298,"thunder rolling Â¶Â¶ thudding footsteps screams screams, grunts gasps It it's alive."
299,It's alive!
300,It's okay.
301,I'm not going to hurt you.
302,"Hey, my name's Noah."
303,Noah Haley.
304,Do you have a name?
305,I am Artificial Robotic Intelligence unit 9.
306,"My Dad calls me ""ARI 9."" Uh, your dad?"
307,My creator gibberish Odd. My memory circuits seem to be scrambled.
308,Running diagnostics.
309,gasps Whoa!
310,It looks like I was recently exposed to a specific electromagnetic energy signature that matches my reboot protocols.
311,That explains it!
312,Nothing else would have woken me up.
313,Th this is amazing.
314,This is amazing.
315, Esto es increÃ­ble.
316,repeats in several foreign languages X marks the spot.
317,This is going to take a while.
318,I'll just let that run in the background.
319,Let's check the other systems.
320,"Uhoh, that isn't good."
321,I must have been asleep for at least five years.
322,Five years?!
323,How could you be asleep for gasps We have to be quiet.
324, Everyone else is  knocking What's going on in there?
325,Are you okay?
326,"Uh, stammers Everything's fine, Dad."
327,"Um, just getting ready for an early morning workout routine."
328,All right.
329,"You know, early bird gets the worm and all that."
330,Just keep it down this early in the morning. Okay?
331,Will do.
332, I don't understand.
333, Shh!
334,"Oh, right."
335,sotto I don't understand.
336,That was my dad.
337,He wants us to be quiet.
338,"No, I understand that."
339,What is a workout routine?
340,chuckles Come here and I'll show you.
341,hienergy music playing  Let's go!
342,thudding on ceiling music continues chuckles That was awesome.
343,What a great way to wake up.
344,So you've been asleep for five years?
345,That's the last thing I remember.
346,My dad put me into deep sleep.
347,I can't remember why.
348,He said it was dangerous.
349,He wanted to keep me safe.
350,"He was supposed to wake me up, but I'm here."
351,So something else must have triggered my reboot protocol.
352,And you said you're ARI 9.
353,Does that mean there were...
354,eight more of you?
355,The others must not have survived.
356,"Once I have repaired my memory, I should have more answers."
357,How long will that take?
358,The damage is fairly severe.
359,It may take days.
360,How much battery power do you have left?
361,It depends on how much power I use.
362,"My thorium plasma battery cells have been severely depleted, but if I keep my activity low, I should have a week and a half before I'm completely out of power."
363,"Once my memory is repaired, I'll know where to find my Dad."
364,He'll know how to recharge my batteries.
365,We'll find him.
366,"But in the meantime, I have to get ready for school."
367,I always wanted to go to school.
368,Can I go with you?
369,"Love the enthusiasm, but it might not be the best idea."
370,Please?
371,Oh!
372,Rita ...go every single day.
373,I will believe it once I see it.
374,Hey!
375, Come here.
376, Hey!
377," Missed you, honey."
378, How was work?
379," It was really, really good. Yeah."
380, Good.
381,"Oh, h how was your night?"
382,"I never well Uh, pretty quiet."
383,I slept all night.
384, Oh.
385," Nnot only that, he woke up early to get a workout in this morning."
386,ARI Early worms are for the birds.
387,Shh! Sure is a great day...
388, ARI giggling  ...for learning.
389,"I'll meet you in the car, Dad."
390,This early?
391,"Oh, that was energetic."
392,I guess he must've had a blast last night.
393, Yeah.
394, Yeah.
395,Sr. Executive Why would you scrap a perfectly good robot?
396,All the time and money?
397,For what?
398,"The A.R.I. 9 was proving to be quite the liability, sir."
399,We could never successfully wake it from sleep mode.
400,"But it's not an entire loss, sir."
401,We're working with the X1.
402,The only thing that we need to build from scratch   is the internal processor.
403," The brain, if you will."
404,Do you hear yourselves?
405,A brainless robot is just about as useful to me as a washing machine.
406,"Why don't you pull the code you need from the brain of the nonfunctional A.R.I. 9,  stick it in the brain  for the X1?"
407,That just might work.
408,"Yeah, of course it will work."
409,There's a reason they pay me the big bucks.
410,"chuckles So the, uh, project X1 is a go then, sir?"
411,You have one week to deliver real results.
412," Otherwise, the board's gonna  pull your funding out  in the end."
413,"Braddock No, sir,  we won't let you down."
414," It's a new design,  one that is superior  to the A.R.I. 9 in every way."
415,"Uh, I'm, uh, afraid that it  It it appea  appears we have a Spit it out, Simon."
416,The A.R.I. 9 is gone.
417," What do you mean, ""gone""?"
418,"   After the last attempt, the A.R.I. 9 was placed on a cart  and stored right here  in the vault for dismantling."
419, And?
420, The cart the A.R.I. 9 was on is empty.
421,"Well, he didn't just get up and walk out."
422,Or did we do it?
423, Did it work?
424,  It's highly unlikely.
425,The A.R.I. 9 was unresponsive when we disconnected it from the flux array.
426,"Without some kind of external catalyst,  I don't see  how it's possible Why can't we just check the security footage and see what happened?"
427,"There's been a minor setback in the security department, sir."
428,"The power surge from the last attempt to wake the A.R.I. 9 resulted in a shock wave that terminated any electronic devices operating within Yes, all the video cameras went offline and did not record for several hours after the last attempt."
429, All of them?
430," Well, our wing, sir, and uh, the the entire facility, and three other buildings on the block."
431,The news has reported that it was an EMP and now we have a bunch of conspiracy bloggers on the Internet that think we are hiding aliens.
432,"sighs laughs If the A.R.I. 9 is causing this much chaos in sleep mode, perhaps we should take a hint and move on to something else."
433,"I've often thought the same thing myself Sir, I know how frustrating this is for you."
434,"A.R.I. 9 is very special, sir."
435,"And if it is out there fully operational in the real world, well, this could be a PR nightmare, sir."
436,The A.R.I. 9 is the only thing we have to show for all the millions they've poured into this program.
437,And a really healthy quarter would help us save face.
438,"All right, listen."
439,"You have two days to find that thing, get it back here."
440," If it's functional, great."
441," If not, pluck out the brain  and stick it in the X1."
442,"Oh, sir, that is a very smart strategy."
443,Would you like me to assemble a team and track this robot down?
444,Local police?
445,Former soldiers.
446,They would be more discreet.
447,Mercenaries?
448,"No, they prefer to be called ""security contractors,"" sir."
449,Â¶Â¶ You turned it on without me!
450,I woke up this morning and he was just walking around my room.
451,"At first, he was scared, and to be honest, so was I."
452," You keep saying ""he.""  He's alive, Bethany."
453,"scoffs ARI, this is Bethany."
454,She's my friend.
455,"Well, some would even say best friend."
456,"It's nice to meet you, ARI."
457,"It's very nice to meet you, Bethany."
458,ARI just said my name.
459,That is so cool!
460,What did your dad say?
461,"Um, he doesn't know about it yet."
462,I'm a secret!
463,"You're trying to keep him a secret, but you brought him here?"
464,I've always wanted to go to school.
465,He really wanted to come with me.
466,"I mean, what was I supposed to say?"
467,"Oh, good luck keeping this under wraps."
468,"Noah, why am I a secret?"
469,"Yeah, Noah."
470,Why is ARI a secret?
471,"Um, because..."
472,I sort of stole you.
473,"What? Noah, I thought we were friends."
474,We are.
475,I took you out of a bad place.
476,They were going to crush you and dismantle you.
477,So... you saved me.
478,"Yeah, um, guess I did. chuckles Thank you, Noah."
479,"Hey, you would do the same for me."
480,You bet I would.
481,But I don't understand.
482,Why would my Dad send me to be crushed and dismantled?
483,"Did you say ""Dad""?"
484,"How can, like  Who's who's your dad?"
485, Not sure yet.
486,It's a long story.
487,His memory is coming back to him a little bit at a time.
488,And we have to find it before next week or my batteries are gibberish snickering We have to be quiet.
489,Â¶Â¶ bell rings ARI beeping Shh! Don't make so much noise!
490,Mr. Stanny Good morning.
491,I hope everyone had a good night's sleep.

498,Um... Noah.
499,"Do you mind coming up and sharing your essay with the class, please?"
500," imitates fart  students laugh Zack, we don't need any of that today."

505,"""Friendship by Noah Haley."
506,"Sometimes in life there are these cosmic intersections of fates, people in time that channel pathways to friendships that will change your life."
507,"As people, as beings with intelligence, we understand that friendship can be something that makes us laugh, something that makes you cry, makes you wonder out loud."
508,"And if you're lucky, it can lead to a long and lasting friendship that goes on for decades."
509,Perhaps even forever.
510,Having a friend is a gift...
511,like a flower.
512,"You you have to give it attention, good nutrients."
513,And let your friend know how much you love them.
514,"With nearly 8 billion people on the planet, your friend chose to share their time with you."
515,Friendship is a gift.
516,It's not something to squander or waste.
517,Friendship is...
518,"something to protect, to hold close, and, uh, appreciate."" indistinct chatter Pass interference!"
519,Noah! Hey.
520,"Wherever that came from in there, you're on the right track, kid."
521,Thanks.
522,No problem.
523,"Keep it up, man."
524, Hey.
525, How did I do?
526,It was really touching.
527,It actually felt like you put some effort in the writing.
528,It was from the heart.
529,"Now put that in your Social Studies project, okay?"
530,Â¶Â¶ From downtown!
531,"Nothing but net, Noah!"
532,chuckles Coast is clear.
533,Where are we?
534,Just taking a little break.
535,I'm tired.
536,Tired?
537,"Yeah, like I'm recharging my batteries."
538,How do you recharge?
539, Like this.
540, That's it?
541,"Well, eventually, I have to eat food and drink water, stuff like that."
542, I can't do those things.
543," Good thing, 'cause if you're already heavy, I don't think I could carry you around."
544,"Hey, what are you trying to say?"
545,"Nothing, it's just..."
546,you're solid.
547,It's muscle mass.
548,Or II guess metal mass.
549,"All it means is, I really do need to work out more."
550,playing aerobics routine music Where's that stupid music coming from?
551,"Oh, no! It's those mean kids from class."
552, You can turn invisible?
553, Apparently.
554," chuckles  Oh, wow, this is so cool!"
555,"Look, it's Dorkus McBrainy playing all by himself."
556,"Look, guys, can we do this tomorrow?"
557,I gotta get home.
558,"Nice try, snot rag, but we got plans for you."
559,"That's sweet, but really you shshouldn't have."
560,"laughing He's a real comedian, isn't he?"
561, A real smart mouth.
562," grunts I don't like smart mouths, especially Hey, I'm talking to you!"
563,Didn't your mother ever teach you any manners?
564,We're just trying to have a friendly conversation.
565,And after you gave such a great speech on friendship I found it very moving.
566,What did I tell you?
567,Â¶Â¶  How are you doing that?
568, Zack Is he so smart that he has brain powers?
569,"grunts, groans You guys should probably go."
570,Zack I hate vegetables!
571,sighs chuckles That's incredible.
572,Glad I could help.
573,Are you all right?
574,I am now.
575,Let's get out of here.
576,"computer beeping Sir? Uh, Director Raddock?"
577,You may wanna see this.
578,This data set is coming in from a currently active A.R.I.
579,It says here that it's recompiling its memory and running various system repairs.
580,One of those repairs must have activated the mainframe uplink.
581,So this is coming in from the A.R.I. 9 now?
582," Yes, sir."
583," Well, can you talk to it?"
584,Can you tell it to come back?
585,"Unfortunately not, sir."
586,The A.R.I. 9 was designed as a completely independent processor.
587,It's supposed to think for itself.
588,What about this?
589,That would simply reboot it into combat mode.
590,It's an altered emergency state of consciousness that interprets everything as an incoming threat.
591,"It would still be autonomous, just much more aggressive."
592,"Wait, so, uh how can we use this to our advantage?"
593,I suppose I could reverse engineer a backdoor protocol and siphon data to pinpoint its location.
594,"Yes, yes, so you you can track it?"
595,"It may take some time, but yes, II think I can."
596,"chuckling Dr. Simon, you gifted little weasel, you!"
597,That's exactly what we needed!
598,"laughs Titan, assemble your team."
599,We have a job to do.
600,phone keys clacking Which one is your Social Studies project?
601,"Uh, they are all more like science projects."
602,"When it comes to Social Studies, I just get overwhelmed."
603,Overwhelmed?
604,Overloaded circuitry is a common problem.
605,"You should combine tasks, play to your strengths."
606,Make a scientific Social Studies project.
607,That's a really good idea.
608,What can I say?
609,"I'm pretty much a geniu Hi, my name is ARI."
610,Who are you?
611,"I get it, the silent type."
612,"You're shy, I respect that."
613,You didn't tell me you had this beautiful woman living here.
614,"Look, I'm new in town and I don't really know anybody."
615,Any chance we can go partsshopping sometime?
616," Hey, buddy, we need to have a talk."
617, Now?
618,I'll be right back.
619,My associate needs to have a quick word with me.
620,I didn't mean to break things up back there.
621, 'Cause you're my friend.
622, Yes.
623,"Because I'm your friend, I'm going to tell you something."
624,"I know you wanna find your special someone and Right, like you have Bethany."
625,"What? No, uh, Bethany and I are just friends."
626,Only friends.
627,Nothing else.
628,But she is special?
629,"Yes, she is special."
630,"But we're friends, only friends, and that's okay."
631,"Look, you're talking to a You're afraid I'm gonna get hurt."
632,I appreciate that.
633,"No, that's not what I was gonna say."
634,"Look, buddy, you're talking to a vacuum cleaner."
635,"Don't be like that, Noah!"
636,I don't care what her job is.
637,"Okay, I'm sorry."
638,I'll leave you alone and wish you joy and happiness.
639,"Sorry, my friend there had to tell me something about something."
640,So tell me a little bit about yourself.
641,Is this the emergency?
642,Really? You too?
643,"It's an appliance, it's not alive like..."
644,like you are.
645,"Noah We'll talk about this later, ARI."
646,"Right now, we need to figure out how to get your batteries recharged."
647,Today ARI activated his advanced cloaking protocol technology.
648,"Cloaking, like invisibility?"
649,I wanna see!
650,"No, he can't do it right now."
651,It took up too much battery power.
652,"Well, what happened?"
653,Why'd he cloak?
654,"We showed a couple of bullies what's what, see?"
655,"But it ended up draining a lot of battery power, so I only have four days left."
656,We need to find ARI's dad much faster than we thought and we could really use your help.
657,"All right, sh show me what you got."
658,Whoa! This is next level.
659,"laughing  That's it, my boy."
660, You are learning so fast.
661,"laughing That's my Dad, Professor Eggy."
662,"Hey, I remember my Dad's name."
663,That's great.
664,You're not gonna believe this.
665,Today is my birthday!
666, chuckles Happy birthday!
667, And many happy returns.
668,Do you guys hear that?
669,car approaching engine rumbling Â¶Â¶ This should be the location.
670,"In position, follow my lead."
671,"Oh, you can run, but you can't hide."
672,"Â¶Â¶ Guys, we have to get out of here now."
673,"Â¶Â¶ Come on, ARI, we have to go!"
674,"I can't, I'm scared."
675,"Hey, ARI, I made it down and I'm fine."
676,I can't do it.
677, Just do what I did.
678," Look, I'm right here."
679,Okay.
680,I'm climbing down.
681,"stammers screams Oh! laughing  You can fly, too?"
682, I guess so.
683,Get ready to move in on my mark.
684,scoffs Do you hear that?
685,screeching  Bethany Whoa!
686," tires squeal Oh, my God!"
687,Look out!
688,What do we do now?
689,"Um, I may have an idea."
690,Are they rolling their windows down?
691,Brace yourselves.
692,"Â¶Â¶ screaming We're gonna crash, we're gonna crash!"
693,"Bethany screaming Look out! Oh, no!"
694,Â¶Â¶ Ha!
695,Oh!
696,No!
697,You didn't tell me they were kids.
698,That's news to me as well.
699,Do we have a problem?
700,I hate kids.
701,"Â¶Â¶ ARI Nice flying, Noah."
702,Whoa!
703,I spoke too soon!
704,all screaming  Pull up! Pull up!
705, I'm trying!
706,"Oh, my God, we're gonna die."
707,"screaming I'm telling you, man."
708,They're hiding something.
709,"screaming See? I told you, man!"
710,Aliens!
711,Â¶Â¶ breathing hard exhales sharply I think that went rather well.
712,Dr. Simon Sir.
713,I still have a lock on their location.
714, Ah.
715," I mean they may be airborne now, but they'll have to touch down at some point."
716,"Titan You hear that, boys?"
717, We're moving out.
718, Braddock laughs phone vibrating phone chimes Who were those guys?
719,And how'd they find us?
720,I think they're tracking me through my mainframe uplink.
721,So you're live updating to a mainframe with a unique ID?
722,Something like that.
723,I have an idea.
724,Any chance you got a USB port?
725,Right here on the left.
726,"Um, what's the plan?"
727,"Hey, FP nation!"
728,Coming to you live from the sky.
729,And have I got a surprise for you!
730,I'm dropping my game early and I need all of you to play.
731,So log in and give it a spin.
732,This is really important.
733,So thanks in advance for all of your help.
734,"Until then, peace, love, and flower power!"
735,Your game?
736,"Yeah, Flower Power Up."
737,It's a 8bit racing game.
738,"But if I can modify the game map to match the city, and if I can spoof ARI's uplink signal for every player Then they won't be able to tell which one is us!"
739,Very clever!
740,"Nice work, Bethany!"
741,I do what I can.
742,beeping Turn left here.
743,beeping rapidly And a right.
744,"beeping Wait, no, left."
745,"tires screeching Uh, um, a right."
746,"tires screeching beeping rapidly No, sorry, it's another left."
747,"beeping continues Well, which is it?"
748,"I don't know, sir."
749," grunts  beeping continues Huh, what?"
750,What is this?
751,"III I don't know, sir."
752,scoffs That should keep 'em busy for a while.
753,Maybe we should touch down over here.
754,"Â¶Â¶ Don't get me wrong, that was incredible."
755,"But boy, am I glad it's over!"
756,You're telling me!
757,I feel so What's that word?
758,Tired.
759,I feel really tired.
760,How much did that take out of you?
761,Let's see.
762,Looks like I'm down to two days of battery life.
763,Two days to live.
764,What's the last thing you remember?
765, Hmm.
766, beeping Why so many bird videos?
767,My Dad used to take me here sometimes.
768,He's an incredible builder.
769,Your dad built those?
770,"Yup, he wanted to help create a gathering place where people could feel safe."
771,A park for everyone.
772," I'm so sorry, my boy."
773, I had no idea  what they'd planned for you.
774, I built your beautiful mind  and your kind heart.
775," But, ARI, you have exceeded  my every expectation."
776, Now I find Director Raddock  has been keeping  secrets from me.
777," He and his robotics team  want to turn you  into a combat assistant  or worse,  an insurgent soldier,  a killing machine."
778, We can't let that happen.
779,  Do you understand?
780, ARI I think so.
781," When I refuse to help them,  they'll fire me."
782, You may never see me again.
783, And I won't be able  to protect you anymore.
784,ARI I don't want  that to happen.
785," I know, my boy, I know."
786, Neither do I...
787, but I'm gonna  need you to be brave.
788, All right?
789," You will have to enter  a deep sleep,  so deep they won't be able  to wake you."
790," Now ARI,  if I can make this right,  I will come for you."
791, But if I can't...
792,ARI We can't let them turn me  into something I'm not.
793,laughs  That's right.
794, You're such a smart boy.
795,Huh. That's why you were in sleep mode.
796,He didn't come for me.
797,"Well, we don't know why, but there's still one video left."
798,"Raddock  You can't keep it  from me, Eggy. Now step aside."
799, Just take a moment  to consider what you're doing.
800," Please, this isn't  who you are,  this isn't who he is."
801," You're too attached, Eggy."
802, It's a machine.
803, And stop talking  like it's your child.
804, This is happening with  or without you.
805," Now, ARI, now!"
806, You have to sleep.
807," crackling  static Look, this is absolutely ridiculous."
808,Are you telling me they outsmarted us with an online game?
809,"I'm sorry, there's just no way to tell the false signals from the real A.R.I. 9 unit, sir."
810,"Well, would the signal look the same if it were in combat mode?"
811,beeping That blast was a concentrated source of electromagnetic particles.
812,It must be what scrambled my memory.
813,"It must've scrambled his memory, too."
814,Those videos at the park with those metal birds?
815,They're all from the same day in different years.
816,Then that's not just any day.
817,That's my birthday.
818,That's today!
819,powering up ARI?
820,Buddy?
821,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down."
822,"deeper, mechanical voice Target in range."
823,"Hey there there's no need for violence here, pal."
824,"Hey, over here!"
825,Â¶Â¶ beeping wheezy laughter Bingo!
826,laughing continues Go ahead.
827,What happened?
828,This isn't him.
829,"They must've done this, hacked him with some sort of remote override."
830,What do we do?
831,I don't know.
832,I'm scared.
833,So is he.
834,"ARI 9, stand down."
835,"Listen, I don't know how much energy that plasma gun takes, but you don't have a lot of battery power to spare, so maybe take it easy?"
836,I know this is confusing.
837,mechanical voice Do not approach.
838,But you're in there somewhere.
839,This is your final warning.
840,You don't want to fight me.
841,"grunts, groans ARI, we're we're friends."
842,grunts We care about each other.
843,"I know you're scared, I am too."
844,But... this isn't you.
845,grunts You have to fight it.
846,groans I I love you!
847,"powering down I love you, too."
848,normal voice Are you all right?
849,"Yeah, I'm fine."
850,"I'm so sorry, I don't know what happened."
851,It's okay.
852,It's all right.
853,You overcame your programming for us.
854,Yeah. You showed those bullies what's what.
855,Speaking of.
856,Anybody got a plan?
857,Stay close.
858,powering up  Whoa!
859, Keep your voices down!
860,"They can't see us, but they can still hear us."
861,I don't get it!
862,"It was just here, as a little red dot."
863,And now it just vanishes?
864,stammers Perhaps it flew away again.
865,This thing is useless!
866,"Let's go, they're clearly not here. Now!"
867,Â¶Â¶ That was a close one.
868, groans  Noah ARI?
869, groaning continues  The cloaking!
870,How much battery did it take?
871,I only have a few hours left.
872,We have to get to Professor Eggy.
873, Bethany But how?
874," It's his birthday, right?"
875, Yeah.
876," It might be a long shot, but I have an idea."
877,Raddock Is that them?
878,What are you waiting for?
879,After them!
880,What are you doing?
881,"With all due respect, sir, you hired me to do a very, very specific job."
882,And I think it's time you let me do that job.
883,"Not impulsively, and not with all your fancy gadgets."
884,But my way.
885,"And I promise you before the day's out, you will have your robot back."
886,"So, uh, what do we do?"
887,We wait.
888,distant children playing This place is bigger than I thought.
889,Bethany Where do we go from here?
890,ARI Just past the pirate ship.
891,There's a bench where we used to sit.
892,Right there.
893,"ARI Oh, I remember."
894,"Almost there, just a little further."
895,"Over there, to the right."
896,sighs I don't see him anywhere.
897,What do we do?
898,Prof. Eggy Is this seat taken?
899,"Uh, no, go ahead."
900,"Uh, excuse me, are you Professor Eggy?"
901,"Uh, Professor Ezekiel Eggy?"
902,Professor.
903,chuckles Haven't been called that in quite some time.
904,I I have to talk to you about something.
905, Hmm.
906, It's kind of an emergency.
907,Aabout ARI.
908,"ARI. You knew my boy, ARI?"
909,Oh. He's gone now.
910,I used to come here with him on his birthday.
911,"We came together, now I come alone."
912,He loved the sunset.
913,"He's not gone, sir."
914,He he ARI's right here with me.
915,And we need your help.
916,"It's getting late, I I I know how to fix it now."
917,But it's too late.
918,They took him from me.
919,"Professor Eggy, I'm trying to tell you."
920,ARI is right here.
921,"Wait, fix what?"
922,Can you tell us how to charge his batteries?
923,He's long gone now.
924,It's too late.
925,"Professor Eggy, ARI is here. It  How can it be?"
926," It's okay, Dad."
927,"Those charged particles really did a number on my brain, too."
928,Ah! Oh.
929,ARI. My boy!
930,"laughing Oh, what's wrong?"
931,Your thorium plasma cells?
932,They are almost depleted.
933,How long has it been?
934,"Um, five years."
935,Who are you?
936,"These are my friends, Dad."
937,Meet Noah and Bethany.
938,They helped me find you.
939,Thank you. Thank you for bringing my ARI back to me.
940,You said something about knowing how to fix ARI before?
941,"Oh, that's right!"
942,We can supercharge your batteries.
943,I figured it out.
944,You may never need another recharge again.
945,How do we do it?
946,"I don't have access to the equipment I need, but, uh, theoretically  Here."
947," Ooh, thank you."
948,"Um, if I can focus the right spectrum of electromagnetic energy, this process would supercharge ARI's batteries into a state of constant energy."
949,Hmm?
950,Thatthat's great!
951,Where could we do this?
952,"Well, like I said, I don't have access to the equipment I need, but with the right amount of time and resources..."
953,I have less than an hour left.
954,There has to be a way.
955, Electromagnetic energy?
956, Yes.
957,Would a microwave work?
958,"Well, yes, I suppose, if if we had two microwaves with enough power and we were able to focus the energy into his thorium plasma cells, that would work!"
959,"You can drive, right?"
960,"Â¶Â¶ Take a right, take a right."
961, Here!
962, A little advance notice wouldn't hurt.
963,Look out!
964,"Oh, my God!"
965,"Oh, my God!"
966,tires squealing Sorry!
967, Take a left.
968," Bethany screaming screeching Right here, right here, right here."
969,van screeching  Mark!
970, Hi.
971,Welcome to Tally's Good Food CafÃ©.
972,How can I help you guys today?
973,"I need to find my brother, Mark."
974,Why do you think your brother's here?
975,"He's your new night manager, Mark Haley."
976,"Oh, okay."
977,"Hold on, one one second."
978,How are you holding up?
979,Hanging in there.
980, How's he doing?
981, We don't have much time.
982,"What's the deal, Noah?"
983,This is my first day as night manager.
984, Are you trying to get me fired?
985, I need your help!
986,"I can help you later, go home."
987, He can't wait!
988, What is so important that you come in here screaming my name like...
989,"groaning He's going to die, Mark."
990,"If you don't help us, he'll die!"
991,"I'm sure this is very important to you, okay?"
992,"But I'm at work right now, I don't have time."
993,"We'll  we'll talk about it when I get home, okay?"
994,"If you don't help us, I'll tell Dad that you sneak out past curfew."
995,Â¶Â¶ Thank you so much for dining with Tally's Good Food CafÃ©.
996,"Thank you very much, all right."
997,Thank you.
998,You have a great night.
999,Have a good one.
1000,Thank you.

1002," I repeat, target is  still in the building."
1003, operative Copy that.
1004, Holding position.
1005, laughing What are you two still doing here?
1006,We heard their story.
1007,We wanted to see if there's anything we can do to help.
1008,"Forgive me, but what is your prescription?"
1009,Mine is 2.5.
1010,Eggy Close enough.
1011,May I?
1012,"Young man, I'm gonna need all your pots, pans, and strainers."
