11,"Music And if it doesn't look proper for a person who is yellow or Chinese to be walking around the Murphy or Jones or Johnson or Bunch or Powell, I think it would be just as improper for a black person or the socalled Negro in this country as we're thought by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad to walk around with these names and therefore he teaches us that during slavery the same slave master who owned us put his last name on us to denote that we were his property. So when you see a Negro today who's named Johnson, if you go back in his history you'll find that he was once his grandfather or one of his forefathers was owned by a White man who was named Johnson. If his name was Bunch, his grandfather was owned..."
12,.. I get the point ...by a white man that was named Bunch.
13,Would you mind telling me what your father's last name was?
14,My father didn't know his last name.

441,We decided to keep you.
442,This feels good to you?
443,This...?
444,"Hospitality, kindness, compassion..."
445,There's no compassion behind any of this.
446,Taking in the morally corrupt and absolving them of their transgressions?
447,Transgressions...?
448,Oh c'mon I'm a beacon of compassion!
449,Wouldn't you say so young Theodore?
450,"You should be more like your brother, Theodore."
451,"Speaking of transgressions, Jamaal?"
452,"You know all to well about transgressions, don't you?"

473,Only at dinner.
474,A sharpshooter!
475,"I'm not easily impressed, especially by your kind."
476,You care for a proposition?
477,My kind?
478,You care for a proposition?
479,No!
480,"Here, I'll tell you anyway."
481,You ask one more question and I'll kill you.
482,Or you ask no more questions and you allow us to enjoy this nice meal and i'll think about maybe keeping alive until the next round.
483,How does that sound?
