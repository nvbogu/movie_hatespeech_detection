228,"Melinda's not so well, Paul."
229,Not so well at all.
230,More headaches?
231,Got laid up with another one yesterday.
232,Worst one yet.
233,I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg next day or so for some tests.
234,Head xrays and who knows what else.
235,She is scared to death.
236,"Truth to tell, so am I."
237,If it's something they can see on the xray...
238,maybe it's something they can fix.
239,Maybe.
240,This just came in.
241,DOE on Bitterbuck.
242,You didn't come all the way down here to hand me a DOE.
243,I had an angry call from the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.
244,Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block?
245,It is.
246,"Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul..."
247,"but like it or not, the wife of the governor has only one nephew..."
248,and his name is Percy Wetmore.
249,Little Percy calls his aunt...
250,and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.
251,He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance?
252,Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.
253,I didn't hear that part.
254,I'm sure she didn't either.
255,The man is mean and careless and stupid...
256,and that's a bad combination in a place like this.
257,"Sooner or later, he'll get somebody hurt or worse."
258,"Stick with it, Paul."
259,It may not be much longer.
260,I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge.
261,Briar Ridge?
262,The mental hospital.
263,Administration job.
264,Better pay.
265,Hmm.
266,Then why is he still here?
267,He could get that application pushed through.
268,"Hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants."
269,You know what I think?
270,I think he just wants to see one cook up close.
271,"Well, he'll get his chance, then."
272,Wort he?
273,Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime...
274, you'll keep the peace?
275, Of course.
276,Of course.
277,"Thank you, Paul."
278,Hal...
279,"you give Melinda my love, okay?"

1425," Yeah. So, Paul..."
1426,you really think you can help her?
1427,It's not a bladder infection or even a busted mouse...
1428, but there might be a chance.
1429, Hold on now.
1430,You're talking about our jobs.
1431,Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?
1432,"Oh, no. No, no."
1433,Hal would never stand for that.
1434,You know him. He wouldn't believe anything if it fell on him.
1435,So you're talking about...
1436,taking John Coffey to her.
1437,"That's more than just our jobs, Paul."
1438," That's prison time, we get caught."
1439, Dang right it is.

1443,Why do I have to stay behind?
1444,"Well, our boy's grown up..."
1445,gone off to school.
1446,"Harry's girls, they're all married now."
1447,Brutal's a single man.
1448,"You're the only one here with two children, another one on the way."
1449,Let's not discuss this as if we're thinking of doing it.
1450,"Brutal, help me out here."
1451, I'm sure she's a fine woman.
1452, The finest.
1453,"What is happening to her is an offense, Brutal..."
1454,to the eye and the ear and to the heart.
1455,I have no doubt.
1456,But we don't know her like you and Jan do.
1457,"And let's not forget, John Coffey is a murderer."
1458,"Now, what if he escapes?"
1459,I'd hate to lose my job or go to prison...
1460,but I'd hate worse to have a dead child on my conscience.
1461,I don't think that's gonna happen.
1462,In fact...
1463,I don't think he did it at all.
1464,I do not see God putting a gift like that...
1465,in the hands of a man who'd kill a child.
1466,"That's a very tender notion, but the man is on death row for the crime."
1467,And plus...
1468,he's huge.
1469,"If he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him."
1470,"We'd all have shotguns, in addition to side arms."
1471,I'd insist on that.
1472,"If he tried anything, anything at all..."
1473,we'd have to take him down.

1866,"If it can't help, don't tell him."
1867,Ever.
1868,I won't.
1869,"There's no way out of this for you, is there?"
1870,No.
1871,"And I've been thinking about it, believe me."
1872,I've been running it through my head any number of ways. No.
1873,"I'll tell you the truth, honey."
1874,I've done some things in my life that I am not proud of...
1875,but this is the first time I've ever felt real danger of hell.
1876,Hell?
1877,"Oh, Paul."
1878,Talk to him.
1879,Talk to John.
1880,Find out what he wants.
1881,"<font color""808080"">(CELL DOOR OPENS)</font> Hello, boss."
1882,"Hello, John."
1883,I guess you know we're coming down to it now.
1884,Another couple of days.
1885,Is there anything special you wanna eat that night?
1886,We can rustle you up most anything.
1887,Meat loaf be nice.
1888,"Mashed taters, gravy."
1889,Okra.
1890,Maybe some of that fine corn bread your missus make...
1891,if she don't mind.
1892,Now...
1893,what about a preacher?
1894,Someone to say a little prayer with.
1895,Don't want no preacher.
1896,"You can say a prayer, if you like."
1897,Me?
1898,"Suppose I could, if it came to that."
1899,John...
1900,I have to ask you something very important now.
1901,I know what you gonna say.
1902,You don't have to say it.
1903,"No, I do. I do. I have to say it."
1904,John...
1905,tell me what you want me to do.
1906,You want me to take you out of here?
1907,Just let you run away?
1908,See how far you could get?
1909,Why would you do such a foolish thing?
1910,On the day of my judgment...
1911,when I stand before God...
1912,and he asks me why did I...
1913,Did I kill one of his true...
1914,miracles...
1915,what am I going to say?
1916,That it was my job?
1917,It's my job.
1918,You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done.
1919,I know you're hurting and worrying.
1920,I can feel it on you.
1921,But you ought to quit on it now.
1922,I want it to be over and done with.
1923,I do.
1924,"I'm tired, boss."
1925,"Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain."
1926,I'm tired of never having me a buddy to be with...
1927,"to tell me where we's going to, coming from, or why."
1928,"Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."
1929,I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world...
1930,every day.
1931,There's too much of it.
1932,It's like pieces of glass in my head...
1933,all the time.
1934,Can you understand?
1935,"Yes, John, I think I can."
1936,"Well, there must be something we can do for you, John."
1937,There must be something that you want.
1938,I ain't never seen me a flicker show.
1939,"<font color""804040"">JERRY</font>: Heaven I'm in heaven."
1940,And my heart beats so That I can hardly speak.
1941,And I seem to find The happiness I seek.
1942,"When we're out together Dancing cheek to cheek <font color""808080"">(MUSIC SWELLS)</font> Why, they's angels."
1943,"Angels, just like up in heaven."
1944,"I'll be all right, fellas."
1945,This here's the hard part.
1946,I'll be all right in a while.
1947,"John, I should have this just for now."
1948,I'll give it back after.
1949,"You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream."
1950,I dreamed about Del's mouse.
1951,"Did you, John?"
1952,I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to that place Boss Howell talked about.
1953,That Mouseville place.
1954,I dreamed there's kids.
1955,And how they laughed at his tricks. My!
1956,I dreamed that those two little blondheaded girls was there.
1957,They's laughing too.
1958,I put my arms around them and set them on my knees.
1959,"And they was no blood coming out of they hair, and they's just fine."
1960,We all watched Mr. Jingles roll that spool.
1961,How we did laugh.
1962,"Fit to bust, we was!"
1963,John.
1964,They's lots of folks here that hate me. Lots!
1965,I can feel it.
1966,It's like bees stinging me.
1967,"Well, feel how we feel, then."
1968,We don't hate you.
1969,Can you feel that?
1970,"<font color""804040"">KLAUS</font>: Kill him twice, you boys!"
1971,You go on and kill that raping baby killer twice!
1972,That'd be fine!
1973,"Wipe your face before you stand up, Dean."
1974,"Yes, sir."
1975,Roll on one.
1976,"<font color""804040"">MARJORIE</font>: Does it hurt yet? I hope it does."
1977,I hope it hurts like hell.
1978,"John Coffey, you've been condemned to die in the chair by a jury of your peers."
1979,Sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state.
1980,Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
1981,I'm sorry for what I am.
1982,"Please, boss..."
1983,don't put that thing over my face.
1984,Don't put me in the dark.
1985,I's afraid of the dark.
1986,"All right, John."
1987,"<font color""808080"">(SOFTLY)</font> Heaven, I'm in heaven."
1988,"Heaven, heaven I'm in heaven."
1989,"Heaven, heaven I'm in heaven John Coffey..."
1990,electricity shall pass through your body until you are dead...
1991,in accordance with state law.
1992,May God have mercy on your soul.
1993,Paul.
1994,You have to say it.
1995,You have to give the order.
1996,"<font color""804040"">COFFEY'S VOICE</font>: He killed them with they love."
1997,That's how it is every day all over the world.
1998,Roll on two.
1999,"<font color""808080"">(ELECTRICITY HUMMING)</font> <font color""804040"">PAUL</font>: It was the last execution I ever took part in."
2000,I just couldn't do it anymore after that. Brutal either.
2001,"We both transferred out, took jobs with Boys' Correctional."
2002,It was all right.
2003,"""Catch them young"" became my motto."
2004,You don't believe me.
2005,"I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul."
2006, It's just that...
2007, It's quite a story.
2008,It's quite a story.
2009,One thing I don't understand.
2010,You said you and Jan...
2011,had a grown son in 1935.
2012,Is that right?
2013,"The math doesn't work, does it?"
2014,Do you feel up to taking a walk?
2015,"<font color""804040"">PAUL</font>: Watch your step."
2016,Now let your eyes adjust.
2017,There.
2018,"Hey. Wake up, old fella."
2019,Wake up.
2020,"Paul, it isn't. It can't be."
2021,"Come over here, boy."
2022,Come on over here and see this lady.
2023,That can't be Mr. Jingles.
2024,"<font color""808080"">(SPEAKS FRENCH)</font> Go on, you can do it."
2025,"This isn't exactly the Mouseville we had in mind, is it?"
2026,"But we make do. Don't we, old fella?"
2027,I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident.
2028,"I think when we electrocuted Del, and it all went so badly..."
2029,"well, John could feel that, you know."
2030,And I think a part of...
2031,whatever magic was inside of him...
2032,just leapt into my tiny friend here.
2033,As for me...
2034,John had to give me a part of himself...
2035,"a gift, the way he saw it..."
2036,so that I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done.
2037,When John did that...
2038,when he took my hand...
2039,a part of the power that worked through him...
2040,spilled into me.
2041,He what?
2042,He infected you with life?
2043,It's as good a word as any.
2044,"He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles?"
2045,With life.
2046,"I'm 108 years old, Elaine."
2047,I was 44 the year that John Coffey walked the Green Mile.
2048,You mustrt blame John.
2049,He couldn't help what happened.
2050,He was just a force of nature.
2051,"Oh, I've lived to see some amazing things, Ellie."
2052,Another century come to pass.
2053,But I've...
2054,I've had to see my friends and loved ones die off through the years.
2055,Hal and Melinda...
2056,Brutus Howell...
2057,"my wife, my boy."
2058,"And you, Elaine."
2059,You'll die too.
2060,And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it.
2061,"It's my atonement, you see."
2062,It's my punishment...
2063,for letting John Coffey ride the lightning.
2064,For killing a miracle of God.
2065,"<font color""804040"">PRIEST</font>: Almighty, everlasting God..."
2066,the source of all being and life...
2067,"<font color""804040"">PAUL</font>: You'll be gone like all the others."
2068,I'll have to stay.
2069,"Oh, I'll die eventually."
2070,Of that I'm sure.
2071,I have no illusions of immortality.
2072,But I will have wished for death...
2073,long before death finds me.
2074,"In truth, I wish for it already."
2075,"<font color""808080"">(WOMAN SINGING ON RADIO)</font> Mr. Jingles?"
2076,Where you been?
2077,"Been worried about you, boy."
2078,You hungry?
2079,Let's go see if we can't find you something to eat.
2080,A few crumbs anyway.
2081,I know you'd like that.
2082,Look at you.
2083,I lie in bed most nights thinking about it.
2084,And I wait.
2085,I think about all the people I've loved...
2086,now long gone.
2087,I think about my beautiful Jan...
2088,how I lost her so many years ago.
2089,And I think about all of us walking our own Green Mile...
2090,each in our own time.
2091,But one thought more than any other...
2092,keeps me awake most nights: If he could make a mouse live so long...
2093,how much longer do I have?
2094,We each owe a death.
2095,There are no exceptions.
2096,"But, oh, God..."
2097,sometimes...
2098,the Green Mile seems so long.
