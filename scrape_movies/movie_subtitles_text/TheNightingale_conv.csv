204,Do you think I'm an idiot?
205,No.
206,The lieutenant governor finds moral indiscretion in his officers abhorrent.
207,I agree.
208,I don't tolerate any indiscretions.
209,I've spent enough time here now.
210,Noted your conduct and that of your soldiers.
211,I'm afraid I can't recommend you for the captaincy up north.
212,But I was told by the lieutenant colonel himself that he would put me forward to Major Bexley.
213,Pending my recommendation.
214,And I'm afraid I can't recommend you.
215,"Sir, I took on this post with the promise it would be one year."
216,"Three years later, I'm still here."
217,I've been handed the sorriest band of soldiers that ever sullied the British Army and still I've had consistent results.
218,"I've civilized the land got rid of the blacks, made it safe..."
219,"No one owes you anything, lieutenant!"
220,"There is no officer in this colony who's put in more work than me, no one who knows it better."
221,If an officer can't even control the convict detritus that surrounds him how on earth could he command a bigger post up north?
222,I've a long trip back.
223,"I'll travel north to Launceston, see Major Bexley meself and apply for the position in person."
224,If you insist.
225,"The post will be filled in four to five days, I'd say."

227,"Well, no other officer knows the colony better than you."
228,Why don't you take your nag and ride up?
229,It's nigh on impossible to get a horse up that way from here.

239,"We don't have any supplies, no black tracker."
240,"Then get us ready, Ruse."
241,Do something useful for once.
242,Drink up. We're paying a visit.
243,I don't have a good feeling about this.
244,What else?
245,"I lose my ticket, go back to the pen, and you're left alone with him?"
246,"I'd rather us face the wild, take our chances."
247,It's freezing for her out there.
248,You remember how to pack this?
