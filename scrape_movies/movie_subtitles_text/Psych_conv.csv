0,Can you spare four cents? Three cents?
1,Two cents?
2,Hi... did you just arrive?
3,Well... everything alright? Is It?
4,"Well, you got a place to crash?"
5,Some place to stay?
6,â Yes.
7,Hey! Get out of the way.
8,"Trying to get killed, you stupid kid?"
9,What's a matter with you?
10,â Shut up!
11,Dope addicts! You think you can do anything you damn please.
12,â I'm deaf.
13,Oh... poor little thing. She can't hear.
14,Hey man... it's not money... it's life.
15,It's human life. You don't invest it.
16,You spend it. You know what I mean?
17,You don't have to take acid to see that.
18,All you got to do is know where your head is at.
19,That's very nice. Very intellectual.
20,Very bright. Very nice.
21,But it's crap... it's crap.
22,Yeah... it is...
23,â Right Elwood?
24,"Why ask me, man? I'm just an animal, here trying to make it."
25,"Yeah, well you sure do got rhythm."
26,"Hi Harry, how you doing? What's going on?"
27,"â A poem, man. Read it."
28,â Oh yeah?
29,"Hey, want some coffee?"
30,â Crazy. Good.
31,â What you say.
32,Stoney... dig...
33,â Huh?
34,Dig.
35,"Well, that must be wonderful. It offends me."
36,What is it?
37,â A poster.
38,"You got the poem, and the poster."
39,"Hey Baby, are you a Gemini? Are you a Gemini? I'm looking for a Gemini."
40,"No. Hey, you don't understand."
41,"I'm a Leo. I'm a Leo, Baby."
42,"And we are in phase. I mean that is, if you really are a Gemini."
43,"Hey... hey. Hey, I've found one."
44,Hey this one has just got to be a Gemini man. I just got the vibration.
45,"Sit right down over there, Honey. I've just got the vibes. You sit down there."
46,Beautiful.
47,What is it? Gold?
48,"â No, man. This is where it's at."
49,Ice bag.
50,"Ice bag, huh?"
51,â I'll get you some.
52,Out of sight.
53,The Man. Could be narks.
54,"You are totally uncool, man."
55,You know that?
56,I heard you was a Gemini.
57,That's a good sign. There's a lot of pure energy in that sign.
58,"Are these men bothering you, Miss?"
59,"Hey, I ain't bothering her, man... she's a Gemini."
60,You know they're all public. Operators and waitresses are Geminis... right?
61,I had a Gemini girlfriend once. Beard got so crowded I couldn't sleep.
62,What's your name?
63,"Mine is ""Stoney."" Pardon?"
64,I said... would you pass me the cream?
65,My name is Stoney. That's Ben.
66,And Elwood.
67,What's your name?
68,â Jenny.
69,I think she's deaf.
70,Oh man...
71,"Come on, this lovely thing is happening, and you've got to make badtaste jokes."
72,"I'm not kidding you. She can read lips, but I'll bet you anything she's deaf."
73,"What do you say, Elwood?"
74,"â Bad taste, man."
75,Let's kill her and eat her.
76,What are you laughing at?
77,"Wait, wait, wait!"
78,â Oh damn! Leave me alone!
79,"Wait, just wait a minute. Just relax."
80,Oh wow.
81,"â Leave her alone, Stoney."
82,"Oh now, wait a minute man, I didn't mean to hurt anybody."
83,I just want to ask her a question.
84,I'm deaf.
85,Hey... that's cool.
86,"Yeah alright. See, you're really deaf, right?"
87,"You can't see what I'm saying now, can you?"
88,"That's it Stoney. Hey man, nothing sacred, right?"
89,Now wait a...
90,Making fun of someone's infirmity. That's where you're at.
91,"Wait a minute now, wait a minute. She knows I dig her, don't you? Don't you?"
92,And I mean maybe she's just tired of all the sympathy stuff.
93,And maybe she'd like to be treated like an equal.
94,"And she's really hot for me, aren't you?"
95,Aren't you? What were you going to say? What were you going to say?
96,What were you going to say?
97,I'd like another cup of coffee.
98,I'll get it. Serving is part of my racial memory.
99,I'll get it... I'll get it.
100,"Why don't you stay here and do some more tricks for the lady, huh?"
101,I will be the one who goes and gets the coffee.
102,You will sit here and I will get the coffee.
103,"If you see this girl around, call in will you?"
104,Where have I got time to look at faces?
105,Take time... this one is deaf... and a runaway.
106,It's bad enough for a kid without problems that's caught up in this mess.
107,"So, this is kind of a vacation."
108,â Where you from?
109,She's a runaway. The Cops are flashing her picture around.
110,I'll be glad when this costumeparty is over.
111,And these creeps grow up and start to make a living like everybody else.
112,"Morning, brothers."
113,â Brothers...
114,"Newcomers, aren't you? Everything okay?"
115,"Yeah, okay... now shove off. Huh!"
116,"Hey man, that was kind of stupid, wasn't it?"
117,"I'm sorry, man."
118,"Peace and love. Nonviolence, remember?"
119,"You ain't being very hip at all, man."
120,Gone.
121,Peace and love to you too.
122,You got a place to go?
123,â My brother lives here.
124,Alright.
125,"â No, really."
126,â Okay.
127,See you.
128,â Thanks for the coffee.
129,So long.
130,"You know, man is related to man... things."
131,What I mean is everything is part everything else.
132,It really blows my mind.
133,â It trips me out.
134,It grooves.
135,"â Beautiful, huh?"
136,Where is our posters?
137,â Over here.
138,"You going to put them up today, Stoney?"
139,"Yeah, we need the business or we lose the gig."
140,Dave been in?
141,â Not for a while.
142,The bastard's never here when you need him. Hasn't showed up to play in a week.
143,"Hey, Stoney man. Where you from?"
144,"Everybody's got to do his thing, right?"
145,"Now, Dave's got his bag, and you got yours."
146,"Hey Warren, did you get my drums fixed?"
147,"â Yeah, man."
148,They don't sound so good without acid.
149,"There you are, man."
150,I thought we played real bad last night.
151,"Well Itchy thought it was real psychedelic, man."
152,He means crude.
153,â We really dug the violence.
154,"Next time, why don't we just break up our instruments."
155, â And fight.
156,And loot.
157,â For love.
158,Pretty good grass.
159,You... are in no shape to drive us.
160,I'll drive.
161,Beautiful.
162,Amazing. Really beautiful.
163,Okay. Byebye Elwood.
164,Here's for Elwood.
165,Shite.
166,"Say man, houses are shite."
167,"You okay, Elwood?"
168,Have you ever seen The Universe explode over your head?
169,Hey Jenny!
170,"Hey, it's not going to do you any good to yell, you know."
171,Oh yeah. That's right.
172,All I know is that he disappeared without paying his rent.
173,And I knew that I never should have had someone like him here in the first place.
174,She can't understand you unless she can see your lips.
175,Oh.
176,â Do you need any help?
177,She says he's not here anymore.
178,"â Who, who?"
179,My brother.
180,He split over a month ago.
181,I don't know where he is.
182,He didn't leave me his address.
183,Are you sure even he's in San Francisco?
184,"Yeah, I'm sure... look he sent me this card a week ago."
185,He just says... he's not a very good speller.
186,Jess Saes: God is alive and well in a sugar cube.
187,"Now, what do you suppose he meant by that?"
188,Okay... let's get in the truck.
189,Hey.
190,I don't know if we can find him.
191,"But we'll sure try, okay?"
192,Okay.
193,Thanks a lot.
194,"â Oh, that's alright."
195,You'll get picked up in 5 minutes if you don't get out of those square clothes.
196,What? I don't have very much money.
197,You don't need too much around here.
198,It's free. It's all free. You can have anything you want.
199,"You mean, I can take the whole store?"
200,â That's right.
201,That's fantastic.
202,"What do you think, man?"
203,You think I'm red or what?
204,Oh Jesus...
205,Hey up there.
206,Hey.
207,Do you like it? Shoot. Try it on.
208,What are you running away from?
209,People.
210,â Oh yeah? Who?
211,I told you. I was looking for my brother.
212,That's not what I asked you.
213,I thought you said the clothes were free.
214,"â Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute."
215,I didn't mean anything.
216,I'm just curious.
217,You don't have to answer to anybody in this scene. That's what it's all about.
218,You know... everybody does his own thing... okay?
219,Here's some more.
220,Try these.
221,The message is... peace.
222,â Peace?
223,The message is... music.
224,The message is... staring at a crystal.
225,"You mean, like searching for the truth, wherever we might find it?"
226,"No, man."
227,Hey Pandora... why are you dancing by yourself?
228,I'm not.
229,I'm dancing with everybody.
230,If you know what I mean.
231,You want to talk?
232,â Okay.
233,What about?
234,â I don't know.
235,Pick the first word that comes to your mind.
236,Sanctuary.
237,Do you like our pad?
238,"Jenny needs a place to stay, and everybody seems to like her."
239,I think... I think she ought to stay here.
240,Where? It's crowded enough right now.
241,Old Stoney's got a pad all to himself.
242,Yeah.
243,It will scare him half to death. You know how Stoney is about chicks.
244,He's a onenighter.
245,"No involvements, no commitments."
246,Come on. Get in bed with me.
247,Man... what would he say?
248,Who?... He's okay.
249,You're an exception.
250,Hey Wesley.
251,â What?
252,Your wife. She wants me.
253,"Man, I've got my own problems."
254,He told me he'd pummel and pound me into motorcycle grease if I even look at you.
255,"Well, uh... there's a bathroom down the hall if you want to use it."
256,I can't see your lips too well in the dark.
257,I said...
258,You can stay here tonight if you want to.
259,Thank you.
260,Hey.
261,Ouch...
262,Everything cool?
263,Hmm.
264,What do you see?
265,Well...
266,Through a stainedglass window.
267,There's something running on your sleeve.
268,I think it's a louse.
269,Yeah... that's Manny.
270,"Stoney, Stoney! Warren is freaking out at the gallery."
271,Okay Warren.
272,"It's okay, everything is cool. No sweat."
273,"I'm okay... I'm really okay, man."
274,"A few things have been happening, but..."
275,"No, Stoney don't."
276,"Easy, easy Warren. Easy."
277,"â Hey, easy boy. Easy..."
278,"Easy, don't fight it, man. Whatever it is, just relax and go right with it."
279,"You know, I'm okay. Yeah... I'm fine."
280,I've been seeing a couple of things but...
281,I can come out of it any time I want to.
282,"You know, all I have to do is..."
283,Snap my fingers and I come out of it.
284,AlI ever have to do is snap my fingers.
285,â Hey Warren.
286,Snap your fingers.
287,Well you see...
288,It's not working this time.
289,It's just not...
290,Guys... now you stay away.
291,Stay away from me please.
292,"Warren... Warren, let us help you."
293,"Warren, whatever it is, it's in your mind. It isn't real."
294,We're your friends.
295,Stay away!
296,No... please...
297,Stay away!
298,"Now, you stay away... please."
299,You just stay away.
300,Stay away.
301,Stay... oh my God...
302,Oh my God! I can't stand it!
303,I got to cut it off.
304,I've got to cut it off! I've got to cut it off!
305,â It's okay... it's okay.
306,I can't stand it!
307,"It's okay baby, it's okay."
308,"It's Elwood, it's Elwood."
309,Why does he take that stuff?
310,"Don't judge people, Jenny."
311,I'm not judging. I just don't understand why anyone would do that.
312,"Jenny... Jenny, listen to me and try to understand."
313,There happens to be a risk in everything. Even crossing the street.
314,A man. He's got to search out for himself to get any rewards from life.
315,It's as simple as that.
316,â Like that?
317,"You don't understand. Listen, Nietzsche says that it's a very simple thing."
318,This is Steve's. My brother Steve... he made this.
319,Your brother made this?
320,â Yes.
321,"Well, I know him. They call him ""The Seeker."" Do you know where we can find him?"
322,Dave knows.
323,We've been looking all over for you.
324,â Oh yeah? Why?
325,Because you're my friend.
326,And because we uh... need you to play with us.
327,"You still playing games, Stoney?"
328,Since when is music a game?
329,Playing it makes me feel good.
330,So does a paycheck.
331,"Yeah, the old bad thing."
332,"The root of all evil, right?"
333,"No, not bad or good."
334,There is only the truth.
335,"Oh, the truth. Old blackandwhitey."
336,Hello.
337,â Hi.
338,We brought you some donuts.
339,â Too nice. Thank you.
340,This is Jenny... she's deaf.
341,"She's lovely, man."
342,"You know, I like sound, but sometimes I prefer silence."
343,Is she your chick?
344,Not really.
345,No big thing?
346,I like her.
347,"Then you don't mind if she stays here with me, then?"
348,"You know, that would be up to her, wouldn't it."
349,"Still, games..."
350,You're beautiful.
351,"Is... love lesson number one over, man?"
352,"All the games have to go, man."
353,"Because it's all one big, plastic hassle."
354,So live in a jelly jar.
355,â You see this little beam of light.
356,"Well, that's all there is."
357,The rest is in your head.
358,Yeah... except we're in a box on a roof.
359,"In San Francisco, in America."
360,So it seems.
361,So it seems?
362,Okay... listen...
363,We're looking for Jenny's brother.
364,Steve Davis. Do you know him?
365,"Oh ""The Seeker."" Yeah, I know him."
366,Where... where is he?
367,You seek The Seeker and The Seeker seeks God.
368,Wouldn't you rather ask God?
369,We used to have long talks.
370,When he was lecturing in the park.
371,He had quite a big following.
372,Do you have any idea where he lives?
373,"Well, I've seen him a couple of times around 9th and 4th."
374,But you don't have an address?
375,â There is no such thing as an address.
376,It's the city dump.
377,The Minister seemed like such a nice man.
378,How can he stand these people and the way they dress?
379,I've never seen so many... things.
380,Things and more things that people spent their lives to buy.
381,"An output of a productive society, man."
382,Junk.
383,It's getting late. We'll not find him wandering around in this garbage heap.
384,Let's get out of here.
385,"Stoney, right there!"
386,"""JESUS SAVES."" â It's got two letters missing."
387,"He left out the ""U"" and the ""V."" ""JESS SAES"" So that's what it was."
388,"Stoney... Stoney, look It looks like the right address."
389,"All burned out, Stoney."
390,It's been abandoned.
391,A dead end.
392,"Hey, look at the flower children."
393,The funny folk.
394,"My, what a pretty little car."
395,"Yeah, it looks just like a garden."
396,What's it run on? Fertilizer?
397,Flower power!
398,"â No, it flies, like a fairy."
399,You want to drive it?
400,"â Hey, water it and let's watch it grow."
401,"Hey, ain't you kind of far from home? What are you doing here?"
402,We're just looking for somebody.
403,"Yeah, who's that?"
404,â Just a guy.
405,What's his name?
406,"He's called ""The Seeker."" What do you want him for?"
407,I'm his sister.
408,Oh yeah?
409,"Well, you'd better find him before we do, as there won't be anything left."
410,What's he done?
411,That's none of your business.
412,Well... look what I've found. A real love child.
413,"Nice long hair. Oh, look at this pretty necklace of his."
414,Why... why do you want to hurt my brother?
415,Because he's got a big mouth.
416,Because he says a lot of things we don't like.
417,What... what kind of things?
418,Like... speeches in a park. You know...
419,Making... love... instead of war.
420,"Hey, she's a flower child."
421,Maybe she believes all that stuff her brother says about love.
422,"Hey, well let's find out, baby."
423,â No!
424,You bastards! Stop it!
425,No... no... no.
426,No!
427,Don't touch me.
428,No... no.
429,"Peace, man. Peace..."
430,I guess he was a little high Stoney.
431,"â You okay, Elwood?"
432,Whoo!
433,"Man, beautiful... really beautiful."
434,You should have seen it.
435,I was... I was this frog...
436,And a Princess kissed me.
437,And all hell... broke loose.
438,Want to dance?
439,â What?
440,Want to dance?
441,â I can't.
442,â What?
443,I... can't... dance.
444,Why? It's easy.
445,â I can't hear the music.
446,I forgot.
447,"Well, wait a minute. I saw you tapping to the beat."
448,I was watching Stoney.
449,"Say, do you guys have representation?"
450,â No we don't.
451,That's why we keep trying to write to Washington.
452,"Cool it, Ben."
453,â I'm an agent.
454,How would you guys like a chance at The Ballroom?
455,Great.
456,â Give me a call.
457,I liked having you there tonight.
458,Too bad you couldn't hear the music.
459,What did that agent want?
460,To make us famous... like The Airplane.
461,â Hmm.
462,Better not let Dave hear that.
463,We didn't go looking for him.
464,I mean he came after us.
465,"I mean, all I know about the guy, is that he's legitimate."
466,And that he said that he would get us in The Ballroom.
467,"Two dollars and fifty cents will get you into The Ballroom, no problem."
468,David... the acid has curdled and turned you sour.
469,No. I see my friend who'll soon be up to his eyes in dollars and selfimportance.
470,Maybe I should cultivate him.
471,"It's real good to see you in the daylight, though."
472,I know you just crawled out of your hole to save my soul.
473,"Games again, Stoney."
474,Could be you're starting to need things and starting to want things.
475,"And what you don't want too much, they can't take away from you."
476,I don't need anything.
477,"Well, pretty soon that little girl you're pretending not to notice."
478,That one standing right there with her eyes full of love.
479,Pretty soon you'll start worrying about whether you can afford her.
480,"And then it's ""buy now, pay later."" Pretty soon, the bogeyman will get me."
481,"You're looking lovely this morning, Jenny."
482,Tell him I'm right. You're not one to play games. Tell him how it is.
483,I'm just catching a bus.
484,Good morning.
485,"â Hi, how are you?"
486,â Fine.
487,"Come on, we'll be late."
488,"â Okay, come on, let's go."
489,Death.
490,Death is... merely the instant passage to eternal being.
491,A final escape...
492,From the travail that man has heaped upon himself.
493,It is a loss.
494,Only for the living.
495,"We, who in our loneliness cherish his... sweet... memory."
496,And now... while we celebrate his needless death.
497,We celebrate the end of death.
498,This glorious day when man has finally denied and revoked...
499,His right to assassinate.
500,Denied and revoked his right to assassinate his fellow man.
501,War... capital punishment.
502,Murder... highway slaughter... are but memories of an inhuman age.
503,An age before man discovered his primal urge.
504,"And used it in the more creative act of ""love."" Hold it, hold it. Hold it, hold it."
505,"Ben, those are dotted quarters right there... right here."
506,"You come in... it's 3, 4. 1, 2. Then you come in with an open fifth... okay?"
507,Got you.
508,"Alright, let's do it."
509,"Ready? 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2."
510,Doesn't anybody care about anything? Or do anything?
511,"Okay, alright... let's do Kaleidoscope next."
512,"Stoney, I'm going out to take a walk."
513,Or maybe... maybe Red River Dream is better pacing. I don't know.
514,Stoney.
515,"Jenny, what do you want?"
516,Can't you see that we're working?
517,I want to tell you I'm going for a walk.
518,â Take it! I don't have a leash on you.
519,Alright... fine!
520,"Alright, come on. Red River Dream."
521,Ready?
522,"Alright, okay. That's alright. I've got to take a break now. I'm tired."
523,I don't know why you're so uptight man.
524,The Ballroom is just another gig.
525,"It was just another gig, man."
526,I'd like to get out of this world for about a week.
527,Hmm. How about a trip on STP?
528,"â Yeah, 72 hours, right?"
529,I'm not getting near that stuff.
530,They don't even know what's in it.
531,"They say it's LSD, cocaine and methedrine."
532,It's like driving a Ferrari with the gas pedal strapped to the floor.
533,I'll tell you what's in it.
534,It's J.B. 314.
535,It's a derivative of a nerve gas that the Army developed.
536,"That's what I heard, anyway."
537,"The worse thing about it is, once you're up, you can't get down, you know."
538,And chlorpromazine just makes it worse.
539,"You know. So, I'm telling you it's nothing to play around with."
540,I'm going for a walk.
541,â You going to look for Jenny?
542,This is mine... and it belongs to me.
543,I'm only taking what belongs to me.
544,Don't touch it... it's mine.
545,It's Holy. God gave it to me.
546,It's a present from God to me.
547,He guided my hands when I made it.
548,"You're Steve Davis, aren't you?"
549,You've got to make that promise.
550,"â ""The Seeker,"" right?"
551,You have to promise me... that you won't touch this... and you'll let me go.
552,"Yeah, heh... don't worry, man."
553,I'm not going to touch you.
554,I'm not going to stop you from anything. Everything is cool.
555,I'm going to take this with me... it's a shrine.
556,I need it for meditation... the truth.
557,The truth is in the fire.
558,"Listen Steve, your sister is here."
559,â You know what I just said?
560,That's really true.
561,â You're a little high so...
562,Absolute concentration.
563,You can see the flame.
564,Your sister is here. We've been looking all over for you.
565,Your sister is here.
566,"My little sister, Jenny?"
567,"â She's been trying to find you, man."
568,"You mean, that my little sister Jenny really made it?"
569,"Listen, you want to come with me right now, man? I'll take you to her."
570,Oh no... no. I tell you what.
571,You give me a day to get my head straight... and I will come.
572,Okay.
573,Don't tell her you've seen me here.
574,â Okay.
575,She was the...
576,She was the sweetest little kid.
577,"Now, it's been a long time since I left her there."
578,Where?
579,Oh at the house where we were little.
580,I ran from the misery of that house as... soon as I was old enough to.
581,I left there the day that...
582,The day that they took her things away.
583,â What things?
584,"Kidsâ things, you know."
585,Things that a little kid collects.
586,It was just a box of nonsense but they were important things to her.
587,They belonged to her.
588,A treasurechest of inviolable personal belongings of incontestable ownership.
589,I mean that those things were hers. They belong to her.
590,"You see, I had a mother, that was a very ugly woman. She had a fake awful voice."
591,A patient voice.
592,It was as stifling as the clothes that she wore.
593,And she had a hatred for everything that grew or walked.
594,"Anything that had a chance in life, she hated."
595,She had one of those knowing...
596,"Understanding, forgiving smiles..."
597,Her touch was just like a... sting.
598,She was clever too.
599,She was clever at thinking up new punishments.
600,And then... and then Jenny became like a...
601,"A wounded animal, a stricken animal."
602,That was in a great deal of pain.
603,She was snatching at air.
604,"When she grabbed hold of my mother's leg, she was grabbing on to save her life."
605,She was grabbing on as if the limb was disembodied from her bitch enemy above.
606,Then it happened to her.
607,Something terrible happened to her.
608,She just didn't seem like a little girl any more.
609,She seemed like a dying animal that was trying to run away from its pain.
610,It was as if the most terrible thing that could ever happen to you...
611,Had finally made itself clear to her.
612,And I... I don't really remember what I saw.
613,Except...
614,Something...
615,"Black, started sliding out of her mouth."
616,It was... like she trying to spew forth all of her hatred.
617,Talk about a lack of communication.
618,People not being able to understand each other.
619,"Now, Jenny's got it made."
620,Because... since that day...
621,That pitiful little thing has never heard a single sound.
622,Why so happy? Is it the fame or the fortune?
623,"Oh man... Dave, you are relentless."
624,"Tell me your philosophy, Stoney."
625,Let's talk about something important.
626,What color Continental will you buy?
627,"Cantaloupe, man."
628,â That's interesting.
629,Let me ask you this. How do you stand on monogrammed shirts?
630,"Love them Mac, love them. Wear them for underwear all the time you know."
631,Anything with my initials on it.
632,"Individual against the ""collective, conforming society"" and all that."
633,"Well, I don't care what your bag is, man."
634,As long as you're honest about what you want.
635,"Well, I'm honest Steve, very honest."
636,"Listen Stoney, what you really want is that little broad that just groped you."
637,The one you made the date upstairs with.
638,What you really want to do is... do that.
639,But here comes Jenny.
640,What are you going to do?
641,Shall we be honest and tell her the truth?
642,Or why not tell her you have a meeting with your agent and have to slip away.
643,Or you tell her you love her? She'll never know.
644,It's done all the time in straight circles.
645,"Hi... I've been looking all over for you, to congratulate you."
646,Go on... tell her. I'll back you up.
647,Hi.
648,â Hi...
649,Hey... why don't you come over and sit with me. I've got a supply of food.
650,You're all guts Tony... go and have your dinner.
651,Well uh...
652,"I'm not real hungry right now, so maybe a little later, okay?"
653,"Besides, I've got something else that I have to do."
654,I think we've all got to do our own thing. Right?
655,"Man, what a free spirit."
656,"Well Jenny, I guess it's you and me."
657,You going to take that?
658,"â Yeah, I'll take it. You kidding?"
659,Wow...
660,You couldn't have been getting too much from Stoney anyway.
661,â No. Right.
662,And now Stoney's off... having himself a ball.
663,â He sure is.
664,You're going to sit here and be a martyr.
665,"Now, why do people play games like that?"
666,Whether they made it with me is not the important thing.
667,It's facing your appetites and your curiosity.
668,I might be better than Stoney.
669,Close your eyes.
670,"Hey, I can't close my eyes. Then I won't be able to see your lips."
671,That's alright. Close your eyes.
672,The Phantom strikes again.
673,"See, now you're angry."
674,You're angry at Stoney and want revenge.
675,Well I think anger is an honest emotion.
676,I'll help you get revenge.
677,Just beautiful.
678,"Damn it Jenny, what the hell is the matter with you?"
679,"Hey, we've all got to do our own thing, remember?"
680,â Shut up Dave.
681,"Listen Stoney, nothing happened."
682,"Nothing happened? What do you call ""nothing""? Did I get here a little too soon?"
683,"Hey, get this middleclass morality."
684,Listen to the great freethinker.
685,Stick around Dave. I'll be finished in a minute. Stick around and have a ball.
686,"Damn it, stop it Stoney, stop it!"
687,"The moment of truth and you go square, Stoney."
688,"Not at all man, not at all."
689,Use the pad. Have a ball.
690,"I don't care and I'm sure the bitch doesn't mind, do you Jenny?"
691,Don't turn me off!
692,I want to tell you don't dirty the sheets until I get another chick to clean them.
693,"You're righteous Stoney, but you're not very hip."
694,Maybe I'm not.
695,"In any case, don't forget to crawl back in your hole when you're finished."
696,Reality is a rotten place to be.
697,"So, you want a shot of this? There's enough in there for two trips."
698,"Dave... Dave, I'm scared."
699,Don't be scared. It's cool.
700,You know...
701,You know the only reason I came here... was to find my brother.
702,How about this?
703,God is in the flame. What does it mean?
704,"I don't know, a little esoteric for me."
705,But there's an address on the back.
706,"Man, I'm stoned already."
707,Thanks!
708,â Reality is a deadly bore.
709,Dave... where'd she go?
710,She's far away.
711,Come on... tell me.
712,â She's on a trip.
713,A long trip.
714,What are you saying?
715,She's gone to the end of the Universe... on STP.
716,And she's out on the street alone?
717,She's gone to seek The Seeker.
718,She hides and you seek her.
719,"You sick, crazy bastard."
720,Do you understand that she does not know that drug?
721,And that something could happen to her? She could be hurt. Come on!
722,"Hey, what is it man?"
723,I don't know. He set fire to the house and he won't come out.
724,I don't know. Why doesn't someone jump out of the window?
725,Steve... don't!
726,"Steve... Steve, please..."
727,Somebody help him... help him!
728,Steve.
729,"Steve, don't... Steve! Steve!"
730,No... no! Don't touch me!
731,Don't touch me!
732,No!
733,"Jenny, don't move!"
734,"Jenny, stay there!"
735,Dave... don't!
736,Reality is a deadly place.
737,I hope this trip was a good one.
