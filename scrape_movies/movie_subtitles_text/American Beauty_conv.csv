981,That's when my dad put me in the hospital.
982,They drugged me up and left me in there for two years.
983,Wow.
984, You must really hate him.
985, Lighter Clicking Whispers No.
986,He's not a bad man.
987,"Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my dad if he did something like that to me."
988,Wait.
989,I already do hate my dad.
990,Why?
991,"He's a total asshole; he's got this crush on my friend Angela, and it's disgusting."
992, You'd rather he had the crush on you.
993, Chuckles  Gross. No.
994, Chuckling But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.
995,"I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong."
996,He's doing massive psychological damage to me.
997,How?
998,"Well, now I, too, need structure, a little fucking discipline."
999,"I'm serious, though."
1000,How could he not be damaging me?
1001,"I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek boy who's going to spray his shorts..."
1002,whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.
1003,What a lameo.
1004,Someone really should just...
1005,put him out of his misery.
1006,Want me to kill him for you?
1007,Yeah. Would you?
1008,It'll cost you.
1009,I've been babysitting since I was about ten.
