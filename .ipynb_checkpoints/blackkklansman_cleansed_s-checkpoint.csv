272,"""Kill the savages.",
273,"""Kill them.",
274,"""Kill them! Kill them!",
275,"Kill them!"" But what I was saying was, ""Kill me."" That's right.",

309,"Hell no, we won't go!",
310,"Hell no, we won't go!",
311,We ain't going!,
312,I'd rather see a brother kill a white racist cop than kill a Vietnamese.,
313,"Me, too.",
314,"Because at least, if he kills a racist cop he is doing it for a reason, because they are shooting black people.",
315, That's right.,
316," .in the backs, in these streets, right here in this very country.",
317, They're killing us like dogs!,

1555,I gotta think about this.,
1556,"My father, he's sick, and he lives in El Paso.",
1557,I don't know if I can handle both.,
1558,Sorry to hear that.,
1559,Think about it.,
1560,"You're a smart and diligent man, and I've got no doubt that you could handle it.",
1561,I think it's time we get some new blood in here.,
1562, Yeah?,
1563, New ideas.,
1564,"For that reason, I'm planning to step down as your president.",
1565,But I would like to make a nomination.,
1566,Mr. Ron Stallworth for chapter president.,
1567,We just met this guy.,
1568,He just walked in off the street.,
1569,Let me ask a question.,
1570,Is there anybody here who's willing to put their neck on the line for Ron?,
1571,I'll vouch for Ron.,
1572,You know who else vouches for Ron?,
1573,Mr. Duke.,
1574,"Look, it's a big honor, but I. I can't accept.",
1575,"The trouble is, what you good men need is a president who will be constant.",
1576,"On call day in, day out.",
1577,My old man is sick.,
1578,I just found out.,
1579,So I'm going to be back and forth between here and Dallas.,
1580,"El Paso, Flip, El Paso!",
1581,Thought it was El Paso.,
1582,It is. What did I say?,
1583, Dallas.,
1584," Which one is it, Ron?",
1585,Make up your mind.,
1586,Dallas is where the layover is.,
1587,El Paso is where my father is.,
1588,"Dallas, that's where they killed that nigger lover, Kennedy.",
1589,Where you learned that?,
1590,I can read. I can.,
1591,"Well, we'll pray for your pop's health.",
1592,It's him.,
1593,"Hey, Ron, I don't share this  with a lot of people, but.",
1594, Yeah.,
1595,"Well, I'm anxious to meet you.",
1596,"Excited to meet you, too, Ron.",
1597,"Aren't you ever concerned of some smart-aleck nigger calling you, pretending to be white?",
1598,No. I can always tell when I'm talking to a Negro.,
1599,How so?,
1600,"Take you, for example, Ron.",
1601,Me?,
1602,Yeah.,
1603,"I mean, I can tell that you're a pure Aryan white man from the way you pronounce certain words.",
1604,Can you give me any examples?,
1605,"Yeah, take the word ""are."" Pure Aryan like you or I would pronounce it correctly. ""Are."" Negro pronounces it ""are-uh."" Did you ever notice that?",
1606,"It's like, ""Are-uh ""you gonna fry up that ""crispy fried chicken, soul brother?"" You know?",
1607,Sorry.,
1608,Wow.,
1609,You are so white.,
1610,Thank you for teaching me this lesson.,
1611,"If you had not brought it to my attention, I wouldn't have noticed the difference between how we talk and how Negroes talk.",
1612,"Good, good.",
1613,Yeah.,
1614,I'd love to continue this conversation in Colorado Springs.,
1615,"It's beautiful here, sir. God's country.",
1616,"Well, that's what I hear, Ron.",
1617,"I look forward to meeting you, and, uh, we'll be talking real soon.",
1618,God bless White America.,
1619,Come back.,
1620," Oh, my God.",
1621, Who are you giving the finger?,
1622,Hello?,
1623,It's Felix.,
1624,Catch you at a bad time?,
1625,"No, not at all.",
1626,I'm just finishing a meal.,
1627,"Meeting, my house. Now.",
1628,"Ron, get your ass in gear.",
1629,And don't tell mealymouth Walter.,
1630,Welcome to the promised land.,
1631,"In about a week's time, we'll be welcoming Mr. David Duke to our city.",
1632," Oh, yeah.",
1633, Who's packing tonight?,
1634,I'm packing.,
1635,Amen.,
1636,"Where's your piece, Ron?",
1637,"Well, you know, I don't carry it on me all the time.",
1638,"""Don't carry."" No, that.",
1639,I got you covered.,
1640,Won't happen again.,
1641,We're gonna need your good shot come next Sunday.,
1642,Why? What's next Sunday?,
1643,The war is gonna come to us.,
1644,"Well, fuck yeah.",
1645,Looks like we got ourselves another soldier.,
1646,"Just make sure that when you're at the steakhouse, you got your new friend with you.",
1647,"And, Ron, you're gonna want to name your piece.",
1648,This is Betsey.,
1649, Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.,
1650, I'm sorry.,
1651,Don't fucking point the gun at anybody ever.,
1652,I know what I'm doing.,
1653,I know how to use this thing.,
1654, Honey. Do you ever have second thoughts?,
1655, Mmm-hmm.,
1656,About what?,
1657,Killing them.,
1658,Never think twice about killing niggers.,
1659,"You won't be able to take it back, though.",
1660,"They're the first of many niggers  that must die, honey bun.",
1661, I know. It's just becoming so real.,
1662,I always thought it would be like a dream.,
1663,I know.,
1664,It's just so beautiful.,
1665,We're cleansing this country of a backwards race of chimpanzees.,
1666,First the spooks.,
1667,Then the kikes.,
1668,"Free at last, free at last.",
1669,"Thank God Almighty, free of them niggers at last.",
1670,"I love it when you do that, honey.",
1671,Mmm.,
1672,"We've talked about killing niggers for so many years, and now it's really happening.",
1673,Hmm.,
1674,My old man always told me good things come to those who wait.,
1675,Mmm.,
1676,Thank you for bringing me into your life.,
1677,For loving me like you do.,
1678,"For giving me a purpose, direction.",
1679,This could be the new Boston Tea Party.,
1680,Mmm.,
1681,Mr. Stallworth.,
1682,Pleased to meet you.,
1683,Names of chapter members?,
1684,What is this about?,
1685,Two names on your list work at NORAD.,
1686,"The two mystery men, Steve and Jerry?",
1687,Real names are Harry Dricks and Kevin Nelson.,
1688,Two clowns with top security clearances.,
1689,These Klansmen are in charge of monitoring our safety.,
1690,You've done a service to your country.,
1691,We've been following your investigation.,
1692,Impressive.,
1693,"Last night, Fort Carson reported several C-4 explosives missing from their armory.",
1694, No suspects.,
1695, Klan?,
1696,"Wait, the KKK and the United States Army?",
1697,"You won't see this on the news for obvious reasons, but thought it might be of interest to you.",
1698,"If you know about a possible attack, I need to know when.",
1699,You're the one with the impressive investigation.,
1700,But can't you or the FBI chip in?,
1701,Sir?,
1702,FBI?,
1703,Federal Bureau of Investigation?,
1704,We never had this conversation.,
1705,"You can hate me all you want, all right?",
1706,Just promise me you won't go to that protest.,
1707,I'm going. We're going.,
1708,What are you talking about?,
1709,"I can't get into specifics, but today the Klan is planning an attack.",
1710, Then we have to tell the people.,
1711, It's not an option.,
1712,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1713,What's wrong with you?,
1714,No one else can know while it's an active investigation.,
1715,Active investigation?,
1716,"And pray tell, how do you know that?",
1717,Are you a pig?,
1718, No.,
1719," What are you, then?",
1720,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1721,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1722,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1723,Want to sit?,
1724,No. I'll stand.,
1725,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1726,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1727,I'm an undercover detective.,
1728,I'm investigating the Klan.,
1729,Fucking KKK?,
1730,"Ron Stallworth, you lied to me.",
1731,Is that even your real name?,
1732,Ron Stallworth is my first and last name.,
1733,"Look, today is not the day, Patrice.",
1734,I take my duties as the president of the Black Student Union seriously.,
1735,"Well, how much good did it do?",
1736,"You could sit in the middle of Nevada Avenue, light yourself on fire, the KKK will still be here.",
1737,"Well, at least I would be doing something, unlike you.",
1738, Unlike me?,
1739, Yeah.,
1740,"Don't think, just because I don't wear a black beret or a black leather jacket, black Ray-Bans, screaming, ""Kill Whitey,"" that I don't care about my people.",
1741,"The night we saw Brother Kwame speak, were you undercover then, too?",
1742,That's not fair.,
1743, You have to understand.,
1744, Answer the question.,
1745,Were you undercover the night we met? Yes or no?,
1746,"Ron Stallworth, are you for the revolution and the liberation of black people?",
1747,I'm an undercover detective for the Colorado Springs Police.,
1748,It's my J-O-B.,
1749,That's the truth.,
1750,"House niggers said they had a J-O-B, too.",
1751,You disgust me.,
1752,"My brother, you need to wake up.",
1753,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1754,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1755,Are you fucking kidding me?,
1756,You don't cross those lines.,
1757,"This is about an investigation, not a relationship.",
1758,Hate to break that blue wall of silence.,
1759,Nice one.,
1760, Is Patrice really in danger?,
1761, Maybe.,
1762,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1763,"Ungawa, Black Power!",
1764,It's off.,
1765,Yep.,
1766,You'll know soon enough.,
1767,What?,
1768,Felix just said the march has been canceled.,
1769, Why?,
1770, Could be all the death threats.,
1771,"No, they're used to that.",
1772,And there's been nothing more about the explosives?,
1773,No.,
1774,Fuck it.,
1775,We get them on weapons charges and stop them from doing anything that way.,
1776,"Then what? You know, misdemeanor at best.",
1777, Then they walk.,
1778, I have a special assignment for Ron.,
1779,Ron already has an assignment.,
1780,"Yeah, what could be more important than preventing an attack, sir?",
1781,We have very credible threats against David Duke's life.,
1782,"So, Ron, I am assigning you security detail  for David Duke.",
1783, What?,
1784,"With all due respect, sir, I don't think this is a wise decision, given the situation.",
1785,Who cares what you think?,
1786,Duke needs protection.,
1787,There's no one else available.,
1788,Nut-cracking time.,
1789,Put aside your personal politics.,
1790,"Chief, it's not about that, and you know it.",
1791,David Duke and Ron have been talking on the phone several times.,
1792,If he recognizes his voice.,
1793,"If any of the Klansmen do, it'll compromise our entire investigation.",
1794, It's too dangerous.,
1795," Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you boast to me that you were fluent in both English and jive?",
1796, Do you remember that?,
1797, Answer the Chief.,
1798,"Oh, shut the fuck up, Landers.",
1799,"You know, you've been trying to sabotage me since day one.",
1800,"Why are you getting so worked up, boy?",
1801," Hey, Ron!",
1802," Hey, Ron, come on.",
1803," Ron, Ron, no! Ron!",
1804, It's not worth it.,
1805," Okay, okay, all right.",
1806, Just.,
1807," Go, go, go.",
1808, Stay put.,
1809," Ron. Whoa, whoa!",
1810, What the fuck is that?,
1811,"Gotta bring something to get something, Landers.",
1812,Eat a white dick!,
1813,You let him get to you that easy?,
1814,You don't have a shot with David Duke.,
1815,"First, the primary target.",
1816,Felix says you're doing it.,
1817,"So all you have to do is set the pocketbook on the front porch, the back porch, a sidewalk.",
1818,Doesn't matter.,
1819,"As long as it's against the building, you can plant it anywhere.",
1820,I got enough C-4 here to take out the whole thing.,
1821,Be careful.,
1822, You understand?,
1823, I understand.,
1824,All you have to do when you placed it.,
1825,"Hey, sweetie. You listening?",
1826,All you have to do when you placed it is flip the switch.,
1827,Flip the switch.,
1828,That's it.,
1829,You got it?,
1830,Miss Black Student Union Bitch is bringing in some old coon to speak.,
1831,Place should be packed.,
1832,"So, Brother Walker, nothing but rubble.",
1833,And barbecued niggers.,
1834, And what happens if that don't work?,
1835, Plan B.,
1836,"Can you handle it, honey?",
1837,You can count on me.,
1838,I've been waiting to do my part.,
1839,Sweet as candy.,
1840,"Ah, look at the lovebirds.",
1841,Can I feel the C-4?,
1842,No C-4 for you.,
1843,You'll blow us all the fuck up to kingdom come.,
1844, What is this black.,
1845, Out here with  the great David Duke.,
1846, Look at this fucking guy.,
1847,How's he getting away with that?,
1848,Mr. Duke's security detail.,
1849, What?,
1850, Fuck this guy.,
1851,Mr. Duke.,
1852,I'm a detective from the Colorado Springs Police Department.,
1853,I'm here to keep you safe today.,
1854," I'm sorry, have we met before?",
1855, Mmm-mmm.,
1856,You may know that there's several credible threats against your life.,
1857,How's it going out here?,
1858,"There have been threats on my life, and this is the detective they've assigned as my bodyguard.",
1859,"Mr. Duke, I don't agree with your philosophies.",
1860,"However, I'm a professional, so I will do everything within my means and beyond  to make sure you're safe.",
1861," Okay, I appreciate your professionalism.",
1862,"Allow me, sir.",
1863,Thank you.,
1864," Right this way, sir.",
1865, Walt.,
1866, Bro. How are you?,
1867, Sir.,
1868,Sorry for all the extra security today.,
1869,Can't be too careful.,
1870,"Yeah, I know.",
1871,"We have a strong, strong.",
1872,"Hey, fellas.",
1873,"Yeah, like you were saying, last week on the phone.",
1874,"Well, Mr. Duke.",
1875,"I would like you to meet our newest recruit, Ron Stallworth.",
1876,"Ron Stallworth, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person.",
1877,Same. Same.,
1878,You as well.,
1879,"This is our brother, Jesse.",
1880, I'm Jesse.,
1881," Hey, Jesse.",
1882, Ron.,
1883," Ron, yeah.",
1884, I've heard so much about you.,
1885," Oh, okay.",
1886,I didn't realize how nervous I was gonna be.,
1887,That's all right.,
1888,What's that doing here?,
1889,That's the fucking cop they got to guard Mr. Duke.,
1890,Isn't that the living shit?,
1891,"Gentlemen, it's time.",
1892," Ron, why don't you follow me?",
1893, Okay.,
1894,Let's go. Let's go.,
1895,You stay right here.,
1896,You hear?,
1897,"God, America's going to hell in a handbasket.",
1898,"That started out as a nice spring day back there in Waco, Texas.",
1899,"May 15, 1916.",
1900,Jesse Washington.,
1901,Was a friend of mine.,
1902,He was 17.,
1903,I was 18.,
1904,We kind of looked at Jesse and called him slow.,
1905,"Today, you'd call him mentally retarded.",
1906,They claimed Jesse raped and murdered a white woman by the name of Lucy Fryer.,
1907,"They put Jesse on trial, and he was convicted by an all-white jury after they deliberated for only four minutes.",
1908,"My brothers in Christ, Nobel Prize recipient, co-creator of the transistor and a dear, dear friend of mine, Dr. William Shockley, whose groundbreaking scientific work ushered in the computer age, has proven, through his research with eugenics, that each of us here has flowing through our veins the genes of a superior race.",
1909,It's a fact.,
1910,It's a fact.,
1911,It can't be disputed.,
1912,"Today, we celebrate that truth.",
1913,"Masks off, hoods on.",
1914,I was working across the street at the shoeshine parlor.,
1915,"And after the verdict, a mob grabbed Jesse, put a chain around his neck and dragged him out of the courthouse.",
1916,"Oh, my God.",
1917,I knew I had to hide.,
1918,That way.,
1919,"Be careful, brother.",
1920,"Well, all right.",
1921,"Where I was, the shoe parlor had a window up in the attic.",
1922,And I could see the crowd.,
1923,They marched Jesse through the streets.,
1924,They stabbed him and beat him.,
1925,Oh!,
1926,"And finally, in a bloody heap, they held him down in the street and cut off his testicles.",
1927,"God, give us true white men.",
1928,"The Invisible Empire demands strong minds, great hearts, true faith, clean and ready hands.",
1929,Men who have honor.,
1930,Men who will not lie.,
1931,Men who can stand before a demagogue and damn his treacherous flatteries without blinking.,
1932,"God, give us real men.",
1933,Courageous men who flinch not at duty.,
1934,"Men of dependable character, men of sterling worth.",
1935,"Then wrongs will be redressed, and right shall rule the Earth.",
1936,"God, give us true white men.",
1937,Ron Stallworth.,
1938,Rise.,
1939,Step forward.,
1940,The police and the city officials were out there watching him.,
1941, They cut off his fingers.,
1942, Oh!,
1943,And threw coal oil all over his body.,
1944,They lit a bonfire and raised him and lowered him over these flames over and over and over again.,
1945,"Ron Stallworth, are you a white, non-Jewish American citizen?",
1946,Yes.,
1947,Yes what?,
1948,"Yes, I am a white, non-Jewish American citizen.",
1949,Are you in favor of a white man's government  in this country?,
1950, Yes.,
1951,"Ron Stallworth, are you willing to dedicate your life to the protection, the preservation and the advancement of the white race in mind, in body  and in spirit?",
1952, Yes.,
1953,Be seated.,
1954,The mayor had a photographer by the name of Gildersleeve.,
1955,He came and took pictures of the whole thing.,
1956,Those pictures were later sold as postcards.,
1957,Remove your hood.,
1958,They put Jesse's charred body into a bag.,
1959,Remove your hood.,
1960,Dragged him through town.,
1961,Remove your hood.,
1962,They sold the remains.,
1963,Remove your hood.,
1964,As souvenirs.,
1965,Remove your hood.,
1966,Lot of good white folks just stood there like it was a Fourth of July parade.,
1967,They even let the children out of school on lunch hour.,
1968,Remove your hood.,
1969,And all I could do was to watch and hope they wouldn't find me.,
1970,Come.,
1971,Welcome your brethren who have been baptized by the light.,
1972, Please.,
1973," Oh, my God!",
1974,Let's give them some applause!,
1975,One of the reasons they had done that to Jesse was a movie called Birth of a Nation.,
1976,"It had come out the year before, and it was so powerful that it gave the Ku Klux Klan a rebirth.",
1977,"Oh, God. Oh, my God.",
1978,"Oh, my God. No!",
1979,No!,
1980,"Oh, look at that one!",
1981,"Oh, he's disgusting.",
1982,Oh!,
1983,"Oh, those poor women.",
1984,Don't you do it!,
1985, Why?,
1986, No.,
1987,No.,
1988,The ingenuity of white women!,
1989,"Today, they would call that kind of movie a blockbuster.",
1990,Everybody saw it.,
1991,That's disgusting.,
1992,"Even the president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, showed it at the White House.",
1993,"And he said that it was ""history written with lightning."" What. What is really.",
1994,"Oh, look at that little pickaninny.",
1995,"Watch, watch. They're gonna scare the pickaninnies.",
1996,Get out of there!,
1997, Move. Move.,
1998, Get out of there!,
1999,The inspiration!,
2000,Get 'em out of there!,
2001, Go get 'em!,
2002, Go!,
2003,Go get 'em!,
2004,Hey!,
2005, Send him to hell!,
2006, String him up!,
2007,String him up!,
2008,Guilty!,
2009,Get him on that horse.,
2010,Get him up!,
2011,String him up!,
2012,Yeah!,
2013,White power!,
2014,White power! White power!,
2015,That's why we're here today.,
2016,In the name of Black Power.,
2017, Yes.,
2018, Black Power. Black Power.,
2019,Black Power! Black Power!,
2020,Black Power! Black Power!,
2021,Black Power!,
2022,I'd like you to do me a favor and just look around.,
2023,That's right.,
2024,Everyone just look around.,
2025,"Today, we are privileged to be among white men.",
2026,And white women.,
2027,Such as yourselves.,
2028,Real warriors.,
2029,For the real America.,
2030,The America that our ancestors fought and died for.,
2031,The true white American race.,
2032,The backbone from whence came our great Southern heritage.,
2033,And I want to thank you.,
2034,Jesus Christ.,
2035,I want to thank you so much for never putting your country second.,
2036, That's right.,
2037, Hmm.,
2038, America first.,
2039, America first.,
2040,America first.,
2041,America first!,
2042,America first!,
2043,Ain't this a bitch.,
2044,"If I would have known this was a Klan meeting, I wouldn't have taken this motherfucking gig.",
2045,Goddamn.,
2046,"Right on, right on.",
2047,"All right, now, when are you boys gonna invite me down to Louisiana?",
2048,We'd certainly love to have you.,
2049,Still a lot of work to be done.,
