1160,I can't believe they're still subjecting kids to this. This is insane.,
1161,There should be a disclaimer: Do not operate heavy machinery while watching this show.,
1162,It's incredible.,
1163,This guy used to put me to sleep when I was a kid. It's amazing.,
1164,He has the warmth of a snow pea. Makes Mr Rogers look like Mick Jagger. It's insane.,
1165,What kind of idiot kept this guy on the air for 25 years?,
1166,Me.,

1186,"Did you ever wish that you could freeze-frame a single moment in your day,.",

1191, With the court liaison. Mrs Sellner.,
1192, Oh!,
1193, I can't believe it.,
1194," What, dear?",
1195,She says Daniel has some woman living with him pretending to be his sister!,
1196, Oh.!,
1197, I told her he doesn't even have a sister.,
1198,Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.,
1199,"She's a social worker, dear. Really!",
1200,"And besides, how could he replace you?",
1201,And so quickly. Really!,
1202,She's supposed to be older and very unattractive.,
1203,Really? Oh.,
1204,Mrs Doubtfire.,

1206, Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever.,
1207, You must have had your share of problems.,
1208," Oh, of course, dear. What marriage doesn't?",
1209,"But I always say: the bad times fade away,.",
1210,.and the good ones adhere themselves to your memory.,
1211, Yes. Excuse me.,
1212, That's all right.,
1213,"Oh. As I hold this cold meat, I'm reminded of Winston. God rest his soul.",
1214,When did he. pass on?,
1215,"Eight years ago, dear. This November.",
1216,What happened?,
1217, He was quite fond of the drink.,
1218, Ah.,
1219, It was the drink that killed him.,
1220, How awful.,
1221, He was an alcoholic?,
1222, No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.,
1223,So it was quite literally the drink that killed him.,
1224, How tragic!,
1225, Yes.,
1226,"Oh, but he was a good man, though, really.",
1227,A sainted man.,
1228,"And despite his mountains of faults, dear,.",
1229,.I always say: a flawed husband is better than none at all.,
1230, Who needs a husband when I've got you?,
1231," Surely you don't mean that, dear?",
1232, Well.,
1233," Oh, that's so sweet!",
1234,You can't imagine what it was like being married to Daniel.,
1235,"Tell me, dear. What was so horrible about this man you lived with for 14 years?",
1236,"Well, at first, nothing.",
1237,He was. He was so. romantic.,
1238, So passionate.,
1239, Really?,
1240,"He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.",
1241,"I hope you don't mind me being a tad rude, but.",
1242,.how was he. you know.,
1243,on a scale of 1 to 10?,
1244,"Oh, well. That part was always.",
1245,.OK.,
1246,Just OK? Oh.,
1247,He was probably a Casanova compared to poor old Winston.,
1248, What was the matter with Winston?,
1249," Oh, dear.",
1250,"Winston's idea of foreplay was ""Effie, brace yourself."" It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy I fell in love with.",
1251,Really?,
1252,"Everyone else I knew was so organised, so scheduled.",
1253,"Like me, I guess.",
1254,But Daniel was so wonderfully different.,
1255,And funny. He could always make me laugh.,
1256,I always say: the key to a solid marriage is laughter.,
1257,"But after a few years, everything just stopped being funny.",
1258, Why?,
1259, I was working all the time and.,
1260,.he was always between jobs.,
1261,"I hardly ever got to see the kids, and.",
1262,".if I got home early to be with them, something would go wrong.",
1263,The house would be wrecked and I'd have to clean it up.,
1264,"He never knew, but so many nights I just.",
1265,cried myself to sleep.,
1266,Really?,
1267,"The truth is, I didn't like who I was when I was with him.",
1268,I would turn into this horrible person.,
1269,I didn't want my kids growing up with a mother like that.,
1270,"When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.",
1271,And. I'm sure he's better when he's not with me.,
1272,"Well, you never.",
1273,"I mean. Did you ever say anything to him, dear?",
1274,Daniel never liked to talk about anything serious.,
1275,I used to think Daniel could do anything.,
1276,except be serious.,
1277,"But then, I was serious enough for everybody.",
1278, Oh!,
1279, This is great!,
1280,Isn't this posh!,
1281,I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably need a credit reference just to get in the pool.,
1282, Amazing!,
1283," Oh, Nattie.",
1284,Not a single body that exists in nature. Look at that.,
1285, Lydie.,

1308," Come, Mrs Doubtfire. Don't be bashful.",
1309," No, dear. They've outlawed whaling.",
1310, We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.,
1311," Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.",
1312,"Oh, no. Just go. Leave me here.",
1313,I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.,
1314,You can't get heatstroke twice in the same year.,

1811,What are you lookin' at? Show's over.,
1812," Miss Robeson, do you have any closing remarks?",
1813,"Nothing further, Your Honour.",
1814,"Mr Hillard, since you've determined to act as your own attorney,.",
1815,.you are entitled to make a closing statement at this time.,
1816,"Your Honour, in the past two months, I've secured a residence, refurbished it.",
1817,".and made it ""an environment fit for children"". Those are your words.",
1818,I'm also holding down ajob as a shipping clerk. So I believe I met your requirements.,
1819,Ahead of schedule.,
1820,In regards to my behaviour.,
1821,.I can only plead insanity.,
1822,"Because, ever since my children were born,.",
1823,".the moment I looked at them, I was crazy about them.",
1824,"Once I held them, I was hooked.",
1825,"I'm addicted to my children, sir.",
1826,I love them with all my heart.,
1827,"And the idea of someone telling me I can't be with them, I can't see them every day.",
1828,It's like someone saying I can't have air.,
1829,"I can't live without air, and I can't live without them.",
1830,"Listen, I would do anything. I just want to be with them. I know I need that, sir.",
1831,We have a history.,
1832,And I just. They mean everything to me.,
1833,And they need me as much as I need them.,
1834,"So, please,.",
1835,.don't take my kids away from me.,
1836,Thank you.,
1837,Mr Hillard.,
1838,You've been able to fool a lot of people into believing that you're a 60-year-old woman.,
1839,No easy task.,
1840,And your little speech seemed to be.,
1841,very heartfelt and genuine.,
1842,But I believe it to be a terrific performance by a very gifted actor. Nothing more.,
1843, No. It's not that.,
1844," The reality, Mr Hillard,.",
1845,.is that your lifestyle over the past month has been very unorthodox.,
1846,And I refuse to further subject three innocent children.,
1847,.to your peculiar and potentially harmful behaviour.,
1848,It is this court's decision to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.,
1849,"Oh, God, no.",
1850,You will have supervised visitation rights every Saturday.,
1851,"Supervised, sir?",
1852,A court liaison will accompany you when you spend time with the children.,
1853,I am suggesting a period of psychological testing and perhaps treatment for you.,
1854,We will re-examine this case one year from now.,
1855,Thank you. Court is adjourned.,
1856,I don't do laundry.,
1857,I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.,
1858,I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.,
1859,And I don't do diapers.,
1860,My children have been potty-trained for some time.,
1861,"Well, I don't do washing.",
1862,I don't do basements.,
1863,I don't do dinners. I don't do reading.,
1864,Ah.,
1865,"Yes. Well, we have your number.",
1866,Thank you so much for coming.,
1867, We'll be getting back to you.,
1868, Thank you.,
1869,I'll show you to the door.,
1870,"Yes, here we are. Please.",
1871,"Laura, that shipment has been delayed three times.",
1872,"Yes, but.",
1873,"Laura, I'm not gonna wait another six months for it.",
1874,You do that. Call me back.,
1875,"Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.",
1876,Everything's gonna be all right.,
1877, I miss her spaghetti.,
1878, I miss herjokes.,
1879,I miss her stories.,
1880,Don't worry. We will find someone.,
1881,There are plenty of people out there.,
1882,Nobody like her.,
1883,All right. I admit things were a lot nicer when she was around.,
1884,"The house was so warm and cosy, the beds were always made, and the dinner was.",
1885,She isn't real! We have to stop referring to her as if she were a real person.,
1886," Hello, my dears!",
1887,We have a wonderful show today.,
1888,"We have Mr Van Zandt from the Sierra Club,.",
1889,.and he's going to bring some animals that are endangered species.,
1890," Do you know what that means, poppets?",
1891," Did you say ""puppet""?",
1892,"Oh, no, dear! It's Kovacs! Welcome, Kovacs!",
1893,"Hi, guys. Did you say ""extinction""?",
1894,Does something stink?,
1895,It's not something smelling bad. Extinction means there's no more of a particular animal.,
1896," Oh, my God.",
1897, Doesn't that make you a little mad?,
1898, Very mad!,
1899, Tell people about it.,
1900,"I'm mad! You know why? Because next, it's the chimps! There are fewer chimps.",
1901,Doesn't it make you mad that humans play your parts in movies?,
1902,"Ooh! ""Planet of the Apes"": who gets the role?",
1903,Roddy McDowall! I'd be better than that!,
1904, I'd be better than Charlton Heston!,
1905," And your rug is better, too.",
1906,You could fly to Persia on that rug.,
1907, Shall we tell them where we'll be tomorrow?,
1908, Yeah. They wanna know.,
1909,"Tomorrow, poppets, we're taking a wonderful trip.",
1910,But you don't have to pack because we're going in our mind.,
1911,We're going across the Atlantic Ocean.,
1912,".to England, where I came from.",
1913, You came from England?,
1914, It's a wonderful country.,
1915, Do you know about England?,
1916, It's an island.,
1917,"It's an island, dear. A glorious one.",
1918, They have a queen and a royal family.,
1919, Oh! Just like a poker game!,
1920, It's a full house.,
1921, Some cards don't live at home any more.,
1922,Thanks to mobile phones.,
1923,Do you know what language they speak in England?,
1924, Pakistani?,
1925, That's right. In many stores they do.,
1926,"But we'll get into that tomorrow, boys and girls.",
1927," You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.",
1928, I'm gonna give you two.,
1929," All right, dear.",
1930, Here's one on the cheek.,
1931, .and here's a monkey bite!,
1932," Aaarghhh! Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!",
1933,"Well, that's all for today. Bye-bye.",
1934,Cut!,
1935,"That's a wrap, folks! Thank you very much.",
1936,We're a smash! Number one in our time slot!,
1937,"Yes! Calls from Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Los Angeles.",
1938, All with offers to syndicate.,
1939, Hollywood!,
1940, Daniel?,
1941,   Daniel?,
1942, Yes?,
1943, Miranda.,
1944, Could I talk to you?,
1945,Yeah.,
1946,I'll be right out. Just wait here.,
1947,Welcome to Euphegenia's house.,
1948,A little draughty but. you know. It's nice.,
1949,What can I do for you?,
1950,"First of all, congratulations on the show.",
1951,Thanks. You got to see the dress rehearsal.,
1952,We've. The kids.,
1953,We've been watching every day.,
1954,It's nice to know they can see me every day.,
1955,"Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take a long time to get over all the fights and.",
1956,.all the horrible things we said to each other.,
1957,It's. It's so hard.,
1958,But I know somehow you and I will be all right and we'll get through this.,
1959,But the kids.,
1960,I don't wanna hurt our children.,
1961,So what do you want me to do?,
1962,You want me to pretend everything's all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?,
1963,"Jesus, Miranda.",
1964,You took my children away from me.,
1965,I can only see them now with supervision.,
1966,Some woman watches me with the kids like I'm some sort of deviant.,
1967,"If I try to hug 'em, she wonders why.",
1968,You know what that's like?,
1969,You just sat there in that courtroom and let that judge pass that despicable sentence.,
1970, I was angry.,
1971," Oh, God.",
1972," You hurt me, too!",
1973, You ripped my heart out!,
1974,"You lied. Uh, you know what?",
1975,I don't wanna do this any more.,
1976,"I don't wanna do any more ""who did what to whom"".",
1977,"Ever since this happened, I've been trying to make sense out of it.",
1978,And the only thing I know in my heart is that the children were happier.,
1979,.when Mrs Doubtfire was a part of their lives.,
1980,Yeah?,
1981,She. She brought out the best in them.,
1982, She brought out the best in you.,
1983, And you.,
1984,Yeah.,
1985,They miss her terribly.,
1986, What are you saying?,
1987," Daniel, the kids need you.",
1988,I need them.,
1989,"Well, tomorrow we'll have Frank, who is a make-up artist.",
1990,   Oh! A big knock at the door.,
1991,Who could that be?,
