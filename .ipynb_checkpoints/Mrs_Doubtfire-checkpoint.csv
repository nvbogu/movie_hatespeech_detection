"
42,"- Oops.
"
43,"- Salutations, snack.
"
44,"
"
45,"Yipe. On second thought...
"
46,"
"
47,"Yiiipe!
"

"

"

"

"

"
54,"
"
55,"No, birdnapped!
"
56,"
"
57,"A cup of garlic, a twist of parakeet.
"
58,"
"
59,"Eat your heart out, Julia Child.
"
60,"
"
61,"Excuse me, but isn't it customary
"
62,"for the jailbird to get one telephone call?
"
63,"
"
64,"In your case, I think not.
"
65,"
"
66,"Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.
"
67,"
"
68,"But I'm not wholly without heart.
"
69,"
"
70,"How about a nice soothing cigarette?
"
71,"
"
72,"Pah! Agh! Ugh!
"
73,"
"
74,"Oh, I will not do this. I cannot!
"
75,"
"
76,"Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
"
77,"I don't want to get beak cancer.
"
78,"
"
79,"No! My lungs are blackened!
"
80,"
"
81,"Here we go again. Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.
"
82,"
"
83,"- Help me...
"
84,"- What are you doing? Daniel...
"
85,"
"
86,"That line is not in the script.
"
87,"Why did you add it?
"
88,"
"
89,"- I wanted to comment on the situation.
"
90,"- What situation?
"
91,"
"
92,"Shoving a cigarette into Pudgie's mouth
"
93,"is morally irresponsible.
"
94,"
"
95,"This is a cartoon,
"
96,"not a friggin' Oprah Winfrey Special.
"
97,"
"
98,"Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.
"
99,"It's like telling them ""Light up.""
"
100,"
"
101,"You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
"
102,"if his mouth isn't moving.
"
103,"
"
104,"It's voice-over. An interior monologue.
"
105,"Maybe even the voice of God.
"
106,"
"
107,"(imperious voice)
"
108,"Pudgie, don't smoke.
"
109,"
"
110,"- Actors.
"
111,"- What? Let's ask the technicians.
"
112,"
"
113,"Do you think it's morally right
"
114,"to promote smoking to the youth of America?
"
115,"
"
116,"(whistles)
"
117,"They're biased. That's a mistrial.
"
118,"
"
119,"Daniel, this session
"
120,"is costing the studio thousands.
"
121,"
"
122,"If you want a paycheck, stick to the script.
"
123,"
"
124,"If you want to play Gandhi,
"
125,"then do it on somebody else's time.
"
126,"
"
127,"(as Gandhi)
"
128,"Then I've got to do what I've got to do.
"
129,"
"
130,"That's very funny.
"
131,"Where the hell are you goin'?
"
132,"
"
133,"If you leave, you're not comin' back in.
"
134,"
"
135,"I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.
"
136,"
"
137,"Well, in the words of Porky Pig:
"
138,"
"
139,"P-P-P-P-P-P-Piss off, Lou.
"
140,"
"
141,"- So what about that history test?
"
142,"- Don't ask.
"
143,"
"
144,"- Did you have fun in school?
"
145,"- I painted a picture of a rainbow.
"
146,"
"
147,"(whistles)
"
148,"
"
149,"-(both)
"
150,"Dad? - Daddy!
"
151,"
"
152,"Daddy!
"
153,"
"
154,"- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
"
155,"- Well, I got off early.
"
156,"
"
157,"- You mean you got fired?
"
158,"- No, I quit... for reasons of conscience.
"
159,"
"
160,"Actors.
"
161,"
"
162,"(California drawl) Dude, congratulations
"
163,"on your 12th birthday. Got a surprise for ya.
"
164,"
"
165,"- A stripper?
"
166,"- Ooh, please!
"
167,"
"
168,"- Two strippers?
"
169,"- Hoo-hah, boy!
"
170,"
"
171,"- A party?
"
172,"- Yes!
"
173,"
"
174,"No. No parties.
"
175,"
"
176,"Mom said you couldn't have one
"
177,"because of your report card.
"
178,"
"
179,"(as Jack Nicholson) Mom's not gonna be
"
180,"home for another four hours, is she?
"
181,"
"
182,"Prepare yourself... for the wild kingdom.
"
183,"
"
184,"(hisses like a snake)
"
185,"
"
186,"Coming up toward the very end.
"
187,"There she goes. And she wins that race.
"
188,"
"
189,"Come on off now. Here we go.
"
190,"
"
191,"You want to feed him?
"
192,"
"
193,"See if this guy will.
"
194,"
"
195,"Oops. Sorry.
"
196,"
"
197,"Shoo! Get out!
"
198,"
"
199,"Shoo! Shoo!
"
200,"
"
201,"- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.
"
202,"- Miranda Hillard, please.
"
203,"
"
204,"I know what you're going for with these
"
205,"murals, but perhaps if they weren't so large.
"
206,"
"
207,"- And let's do steel windows, not wood.
"
208,"- Uh-huh.
"
209,"
"
210,"Eliminate the oriental rug.
"
211,"Let's try an Aubusson carpet.
"
212,"
"
213,"- More pink than red.
"
214,"- Good idea.
"
215,"
"
216,"Union Square lnn. This is better.
"
217,"
"
218,"More Arts and Crafts. A Dirk Van Erp lamp,
"
219,"a Stickley chair. Don't be seduced by chintz.
"
220,"
"
221,"Excuse me. Miranda,
"
222,"can I speak to you for a minute?
"
223,"
"
224,"- Yes. Excuse me.
"
225,"- Certainly.
"
226,"
"
227,"Just be one minute.
"
228,"
"
229,"I just got off the phone
"
230,"with a Stuart Dunmeyer.
"
231,"
"
232,"- Stuart Dunmeyer?
"
233,"- Mm-hm. He said you were acquaintances.
"
234,"
"
235,"Stuart Dunmeyer?
"
236,"
"
237,"He's putting millions into restoring
"
238,"the old Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.
"
239,"
"
240,"- He wants to make it into a $500-a-night B&B.
"
241,"- Yes, I read about it.
"
242,"
"
243,"- He's been doing very well.
"
244,"- Mm-hm, that's him.
"
245,"
"
246,"And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.
"
247,"
"
248,"He did?
"
249,"
"
250,"- I told him you'd call first thing tomorrow.
"
251,"- Yes, I will.
"
252,"
"
253,"Miss Hillard? The operator
"
254,"has a Gloria Chaney on hold.
"
255,"
"
256,"- She says it's an emergency.
"
257,"- Excuse me.
"
258,"
"
259,"Gloria?
"
260,"
"
261,"( ""Jump Around"" by House of Pain)
"
262,"
"
263,"- Oh, my God!
"
264,"- Is this your residence, ma'am?
"
265,"
"
266,"Yes, I'm sorry to say it is.
"
267,"
"
268,"Are you aware it's illegal to possess
"
269,"barnyard animals in a residential area?
"
270,"
"
271,"- What if you're married to one?
"
272,"- We're also responding to a noise violation.
"
273,"
"
274,"I'm going to respond myself.
"
275,"I'm awfully sorry about this. I'll...
"
276,"
"
277,"You ate my begonias! God!
"
278,"
"
279,"Get out of my way!
"
280,"
"
281,"(pandemonium)
"
282,"
"
283,"Jump around
"
284,"
"
285,"Jump around
"
286,"
"
287,"Jump around
"
288,"
"
289,"Jump up, jump up and get down
"
290,"
"
291,"Everybody jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
"
292,"
"
293,"Oh... Shoo! Get! Get!
"
294,"
"
295,"I'm the cream of the crop
"
296,"I rise to the top
"
297,"
"
298,"I never eat a pig, cos a pig is a cop
"
299,"
"
300,"Or better yet a Terminator
"
301,"like Arnold Schwarzenegger
"
302,"
"
303,"Try to play me out, like
"
304,"as if my name was Sega
"
305,"
"
306,"I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya
"
307,"
"
308,"Spittin' out lyrics, homey I'll wet ya
"
309,"
"
310,"I came to get down, I came to get down...
"
311,"
"
312,"Hah!
"
313,"
"
314,"Miranda! Whassup?
"
315,"
"
316,"You're home early, girlfriend.
"
317,"
"
318,"Havin' a birthday in the house.
"
319,"
"
320,"What the hell is going on around here?
"
321,"
"
322,"Don't get mad, honey. Listen.
"
323,"
"
324,"You're home a little early. I was gonna
"
325,"clean it all up before you got home.
"
326,"
"
327,"Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...
"
328,"
"
329,"Honey... What are you looking for?
"
330,"
"
331,"I'd be careful. That pony had a lot of water.
"
332,"
"
333,"(music stops)
"
334,"
"
335,"Party's over.
"
336,"
"
337,"(Daniel) She called you
"
338,"and you bust the birthday party. Great(!)
"
339,"
"
340,"(Miranda) Don't you dare
"
341,"make me out to be the monster here, Daniel!
"
342,"
"
343,"You have all the fun
"
344,"and I get whatever's left over.
"
345,"
"
346,"- You chose the career.
"
347,"- I have no choices here. I have no choices!
"
348,"
"
349,"Even when I try to do something fun,
"
350,"you do it ten times bigger!
"
351,"
"
352,"I bring home a cake and gifts.
"
353,"You bring the goddamn San Diego Zoo!
"
354,"
"
355,"- And I have to clean up!
"
356,"- It's not toxic waste, just a few party plates!
"
357,"
"
358,"Why am I the only one
"
359,"that feels there has to be rules?
"
360,"
"
361,"Why do you always
"
362,"make me out to be the heavy?
"
363,"
"
364,"I don't. You do it yourself quite naturally.
"
365,"
"
366,"- You set me up every time to be the bad guy.
"
367,"- Oh, lighten up, will ya?
"
368,"
"
369,"You spend too much time with
"
370,"those corporate clones you used to despise.
"
371,"
"
372,"I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
"
373,"It's over!
"
374,"
"
375,"It's over.
"
376,"
"
377,"Come on, Miranda. We've got problems,
"
378,"but who doesn't? We could work 'em out.
"
379,"
"
380,"We've been trying to work them out
"
381,"for 14 years.
"
382,"
"
383,"Come on, please. Listen.
"
384,"Maybe we need some help, OK?
"
385,"
"
386,"Maybe a family therapist
"
387,"will help us do this together.
"
388,"
"
389,"It's too late for that.
"
390,"
"
391,"Well, let's take a vacation with the kids,
"
392,"as a family. Get you away from work.
"
393,"
"
394,"You're a different person.
"
395,"You really are. You're great.
"
396,"
"
397,"Our problems would be waiting for us
"
398,"when we got back.
"
399,"
"
400,"We'll move, and hopefully
"
401,"our problems won't follow us.
"
402,"
"
403,"Daniel, please don't joke.
"
404,"
"
405,"OK.
"
406,"
"
407,"Yeah. We've just grown apart. We're different.
"
408,"
"
409,"- We have nothing in common.
"
410,"- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.
"
411,"
"
412,"Come on, Miranda. We love each other.
"
413,"
"
414,"Don't we?
"
415,"
"
416,"I want a divorce.
"
417,"
"
418,"(whispers)
"
419,"No.
"
420,"
"
421,"We can't. We're a family. You know?
"
422,"
"
423,"I'm so sorry.
"
424,"
"
425,"Yeah, Ma, he told me all about it.
"
426,"
"
427,"Yeah, Ma. I heard, I heard.
"
428,"
"
429,"- Well, yeah, he's here.
"
430,"- No.
"
431,"
"
432,"Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.
"
433,"
"
434,"Yeah, depressed.
"
435,"I mean, his marriage is ending.
"
436,"
"
437,"My marriage is not ending. It's just on hiatus.
"
438,"
"
439,"Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.
"
440,"
"
441,"No, we're taking good care of your little boy.
"
442,"Don't worry, Mom.
"
443,"
"
444,"- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
"
445,"- She says you're welcome.
"
446,"
"
447,"That beige concealer.
"
448,"When are we gettin' more of it?
"
449,"
"
450,"- Next week.
"
451,"- You hear that, Ma? Next week.
"
452,"
"
453,"Wait, hang on.
"
454,"
"
455,"- Enough already. It's a man.
"
456,"- How would you know?
"
457,"
"
458,"Bitch.
"
459,"
"
460,"No, Ma, not you. I was talkin' about the dog.
"
461,"
"
462,"Ma, listen. We got people
"
463,"waitin' for us on the set.
"
464,"
"
465,"Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.
"
466,"Places to go, faces to paint.
"
467,"
"
468,"Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.
"
469,"
"
470,"Don't worry, I'll tell him.
"
471,"
"
472,"Yeah. Hold on, Ma.
"
473,"
"
474,"She wants to know
"
475,"if you want to come stay with her.
"
476,"
"
477,"- No way.
"
478,"- He says he'll think about it, Ma.
"
479,"
"
480,"I will. All right. I love you, too.
"
481,"
"
482,"Bye, Ma.
"
483,"
"
484,"Hey, listen, you know you can always
"
485,"stay with us just as long as you want.
"
486,"
"
487,"Thank you, but I'm OK, really.
"
488,"I mean, this is just a temporary thing.
"
489,"
"
490,"I know Miranda. It's gonna blow over.
"
491,"
"
492,"Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
"
493,"proceedings tend to favour the mother,...
"
494,"
"
495,"..we also realise, perhaps now more than
"
496,"ever, that it is not in a child's best interest...
"
497,"
"
498,"..to deprive him or her
"
499,"of an obviously loving father.
"
500,"
"
501,"However, since at the present time Mr Hillard
"
502,"has no place to live and no employment,...
"
503,"
"
504,"..it is the court's ruling
"
505,"to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.
"
506,"
"
507,"- (whispers) Congratulations.
"
508,"- No.
"
509,"
"
510,"Mr Hillard will have visitation rights
"
511,"every Saturday.
"
512,"
"
513,"- Can't you do something?
"
514,"- He's made his decision.
"
515,"
"
516,"Isn't it traditional
"
517,"to say ""I object"" or something?
"
518,"
"
519,"Your Honour, please.
"
520,"
"
521,"Every Saturday? That's one day a week.
"
522,"
"
523,"That's not enough.
"
524,"
"
525,"I have to be with my children. It's not
"
526,"a question. I have to be with them, sir. Please.
"
527,"
"
528,"I know it seems like a lot,
"
529,"but for me it's not enough. Really.
"
530,"
"
531,"I haven't been away from 'em for more than
"
532,"one day since the day they were born.
"
533,"
"
534,"- Mr Hillard, this ruling is only temporary.
"
535,"- Oh, good.
"
536,"
"
537,"I will assign a court liaison
"
538,"to oversee your case.
"
539,"
"
540,"There will be a continuance
"
541,"of these proceedings in 90 days.
"
542,"
"
543,"- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
"
544,"- Thank you.
"
545,"
"
546,"Three months in which to get ajob,
"
547,"keep it and create a suitable home.
"
548,"
"
549,"If this proves to be a possibility for you,...
"
550,"
"
551,"..I will consider ajoint-custody arrangement
"
552,"when we reconvene. We're adjourned.
"
553,"
"
554,"Well, it looks like there is
"
555,"a little light at the end of our tunnel.
"
556,"
"
557,"- That's all my stuff.
"
558,"- This is all my fault.
"
559,"
"
560,"God, no. Why would you think that?
"
561,"
"
562,"I should have never had a birthday, Dad.
"
563,"
"
564,"- This never would have happened.
"
565,"- Yes, it would.
"
566,"
"
567,"It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?
"
568,"
"
569,"You did nothing wrong. You got that?
"
570,"
"
571,"OK, gimme five.
"
572,"
"
573,"You're the man of the house now.
"
574,"
"
575,"Don't be messy.
"
576,"
"
577,"- You can't go now.
"
578,"- Honey, I have to.
"
579,"
"
580,"We're in the middle of 'Charlotte's Web'.
"
581,"Who's gonna finish it?
"
582,"
"
583,"Well, Grandma will finish it for you.
"
584,"
"
585,"She's not as good. She always skips parts,
"
586,"and she never does the voices.
"
587,"
"
588,"She smells funny, too.
"
589,"
"
590,"That's the formaldehyde.
"
591,"That's why Granny's so well preserved.
"
592,"
"
593,"Hey, come here.
"
594,"
"
595,"Hey! It's the same as always.
"
596,"We just have a really big backyard, OK?
"
597,"
"
598,"- (whispers) I love you.
"
599,"- (whispers) I love you.
"
600,"
"
601,"I'll miss you. Saturday comes real quick.
"
602,"
"
603,"- I'll miss you.
"
604,"- Ditto.
"
605,"
"
606,"Oh, Dad...
"
607,"
"
608,"- Take care of her.
"
609,"- OK.
"
610,"
"
611,"Goodbye.
"
612,"
"
613,"Thanks for the time, warden.
"
614,"
"
615,"Bye, Dad.
"
616,"
"
617,"As your court liaison,
"
618,"I will be looking at two things.
"
619,"
"
620,"- Your living environment...
"
621,"- It's more like a habitat, really.
"
622,"
"
623,"And I will be coming by on Monday
"
624,"and Friday evenings to inspect it.
"
625,"
"
626,"Well, I'll put on a chicken.
"
627,"
"
628,"And there's always the job issue.
"
629,"
"
630,"This is the nearest employment office. I took
"
631,"the liberty of making an appointment for you.
"
632,"
"
633,"- Thank you.
"
634,"- By the way, do you have any special skills?
"
635,"
"
636,"Oh, yes. I do.
"
637,"
"
638,"I do voices.
"
639,"
"
640,"What do you mean, you do voices?
"
641,"
"
642,"(German accent)
"
643,"Vell, I do voices.
"
644,"
"
645,"Yes!
"
646,"
"
647,"(as alien) We're looking for intelligent life.
"
648,"Oops, mistake!
"
649,"
"
650,"(as immigrant) Happy to be in America.
"
651,"Don't ask for a green card.
"
652,"
"
653,"(as monster)
"
654,"I want you in the worst way.
"
655,"
"
656,"(as Groucho Marx) This meeting
"
657,"is certainly not going well for me.
"
658,"
"
659,"(as Chico) Hey, boss, give her a chance.
"
660,"She's gonna loosen up any moment.
"
661,"
"
662,"(as James Bond) Moneypenny,
"
663,"I want to undo that bow and get to know you.
"
664,"
"
665,"(as salesman)
"
666,"I'm crazy to make a deal with you!
"
667,"
"
668,"(as Ronald Reagan) Nancy and I are
"
669,"looking for the other half of my head.
"
670,"
"
671,"(as Walter Huston) They're doin' it!
"
672,"I'm sittin' on a gold mine!
"
673,"
"
674,"(as Bogart)
"
675,"Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.
"
676,"
"
677,"Figaro!
"
678,"
"
679,"I do a great impression of a hot dog.
"
680,"
"
681,"Mr Hillard, do you
"
682,"consider yourself humorous?
"
683,"
"
684,"I used to.
"
685,"
"
686,"There was a time when I found myself funny.
"
687,"
"
688,"But today you have proven me wrong.
"
689,"Thank you.
"
690,"
"
691,"Listen, bottom line...
"
692,"
"
693,"I need to be with my children,
"
694,"and I'll do anything to do that.
"
695,"
"
696,"You just tell me what to do.
"
697,"
"
698,"- Excuse me. You Tony?
"
699,"- That's me.
"
700,"
"
701,"Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.
"
702,"
"
703,"Follow me.
"
704,"
"
705,"Oh, films! Will I be
"
706,"introducing these movies on air?
"
707,"
"
708,"- Not exactly.
"
709,"- What do I do?
"
710,"
"
711,"You take all these cans.
"
712,"You box 'em and you ship 'em.
"
713,"
"
714,"Then you box those cans over there.
"
715,"Ship them. Then more will come in.
"
716,"
"
717,"You box those, you ship those.
"
718,"
"
719,"Any questions?
"
720,"
"
721,"After you box 'em...?
"
722,"
"
723,"You ship 'em.
"
724,"
"
725,"Lots of luck, smartass.
"
726,"
"
727,"I think I made a friend.
"
728,"
"
729,"- Miranda.
"
730,"- Stu!
"
731,"
"
732,"Hello, Miranda.
"
733,"
"
734,"- It's been a long time.
"
735,"- Yes.
"
736,"
"
737,"Mr Dunmeyer's come by
"
738,"to look over your sketches.
"
739,"
"
740,"Um...
"
741,"
"
742,"Let me show you to the conference room.
"
743,"
"
744,"As you probably know,
"
745,"the estate was built in 1876.
"
746,"
"
747,"These sketches are meant to reflect
"
748,"your desire to have it completely restored.
"
749,"
"
750,"You look better than ever.
"
751,"
"
752,"The lobby will resemble a music salon with
"
753,"inspiration from the French Second Empire.
"
754,"
"
755,"I was thinking a 17th-century grand piano...
"
756,"
"
757,"I've been following your career
"
758,"these past couple of years.
"
759,"
"
760,"A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
"
761,"a brass-bound Regency-style table...
"
762,"
"
763,"I'd love to get reacquainted. Catch up.
"
764,"
"
765,"Mantel clocks,...
"
766,"
"
767,"..fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.
"
768,"
"
769,"Can we talk? Over dinner, maybe?
"
770,"
"
771,"Stuart, thank you. I... I...
"
772,"
"
773,"I... I'm at the beginning of a divorce.
"
774,"
"
775,"It just didn't work out.
"
776,"
"
777,"- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
"
778,"- You don't have to say that.
"
779,"
"
780,"No, really. I mean, I never
"
781,"held any grudges or anything. I just...
"
782,"
"
783,"Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.
"
784,"
"
785,"Oh, God, that's so nice.
"
786,"
"
787,"I was just worried my coming in here
"
788,"might scare you off the project.
"
789,"
"
790,"No, no. Of course not. l...
"
791,"
"
792,"I'm a professional. I'm...
"
793,"
"
794,"I was flattered that you thought of me
"
795,"after all these years and everything.
"
796,"
"
797,"Yeah, everything.
"
798,"
"
799,"Well... Ancient history.
"
800,"
"
801,"Yeah.
"
802,"
"
803,"Yeah.
"
804,"
"
805,"- I'm late. I've got a meeting at the bank.
"
806,"- Oh.
"
807,"
"
808,"Can we talk maybe later in the week?
"
809,"
"
810,"- Sure.
"
811,"- Good.
"
812,"
"
813,"It's good to see you again.
"
814,"
"
815,"(Daniel)
"
816,"Mmm, good, huh?
"
817,"
"
818,"I know the place
"
819,"doesn't look like much now, but...
"
820,"
"
821,"..it'll be OK. How do you like it?
"
822,"
"
823,"- Nice.
"
824,"- It's OK.
"
825,"
"
826,"Detestable.
"
827,"
"
828,"Hey, just give me some time.
"
829,"
"
830,"I'm not too comfortable
"
831,"with this new lifestyle.
"
832,"
"
833,"Neither are we.
"
834,"
"
835,"I know it's hard, sweetie.
"
836,"
"
837,"Can't you just tell Mom you're sorry?
"
838,"
"
839,"Wish I could.
"
840,"
"
841,"You know, grown-up problems...
"
842,"
"
843,"They're a little more complicated, Nattie.
"
844,"
"
845,"How is the old battle-axe?
"
846,"
"
847,"- Your mom.
"
848,"- She's fine.
"
849,"
"
850,"Oh. I'm glad to hear that.
"
851,"
"
852,"I'd hate to think that she came down
"
853,"with amoebic dysentery or piles.
"
854,"
"
855,"What's amoebic dysentery?
"
856,"
"
857,"It's an infection in your tummy
"
858,"where you get diarrhoea for ever.
"
859,"
"
860,"- Diarrhoea for ever?
"
861,"- And your body dries up and you die.
"
862,"
"
863,"- You die?
"
864,"- You don't have to be so graphic with her.
"
865,"
"
866,"- I read about it in a science book.
"
867,"- Why would you want Mommy to die?
"
868,"
"
869,"Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.
"
870,"
"
871,"Then why did you say that?
"
872,"
"
873,"Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.
"
874,"
"
875,"We only get to come here once a week.
"
876,"That's not very much.
"
877,"
"
878,"You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
"
879,"
"
880,"Nattie, I'll think good thoughts, OK?
"
881,"
"
882,"- About Mommy?
"
883,"- I'll try. I really will.
"
884,"
"
885,"- And call her a princess.
"
886,"- Oh... Oh, yes.
"
887,"
"
888,"And right now I feel like a toad. (croaks)
"
889,"
"
890,"(Daniel)
"
891,"Daddy's a toad.
"
892,"
"
893,"(car horn)
"
894,"
"
895,"- That's Mom.
"
896,"- Can't be. She's an hour early.
"
897,"
"
898,"Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.
"
899,"
"
900,"No, no! Come on, sit down, sit down.
"
901,"
"
902,"Sit down!
"
903,"
"
904,"You don't have to run off
"
905,"when she honks the horn.
"
906,"
"
907,"Come on, you're on my time now.
"
908,"
"
909,"You're my goddamn kids, too!
"
910,"
"
911,"Come on. Hey.
"
912,"
"
913,"Hi.
"
914,"
"
915,"Oh, Daniel... Charming.
"
916,"
"
917,"Thank you, Miranda.
"
918,"I was going for a refugee motif.
"
919,"
"
920,"Fleeing-my-homeland kind of thing.
"
921,"
"
922,"But look at you!
"
923,"
"
924,"This lovely 'Dances with Wolves' motif.
"
925,"What's your lndian name: Shops With A Fist?
"
926,"
"
927,"- Are my children ready yet?
"
928,"- No, our children are not ready yet...
"
929,"
"
930,"..because you are an hour early
"
931,"and you were late dropping them off.
"
932,"
"
933,"Daniel, I don't have time for this. I have to
"
934,"drop something off at the newspaper office.
"
935,"
"
936,"Newspaper? Are you taking out
"
937,"one of those personal ads?
"
938,"
"
939,"""DWF seeks WWWM with BMW,
"
940,"into light B&D""?
"
941,"
"
942,"I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.
"
943,"
"
944,"Housekeeper?
"
945,"Why do you need a housekeeper?
"
946,"
"
947,"I need someone to be there when the children
"
948,"get home from school, to clean, start dinner...
"
949,"
"
950,"- How much are you gonna pay?
"
951,"- $300 a week. Is that all right?
"
952,"
"
953,"300...
"
954,"
"
955,"- May I see the ad?
"
956,"-(sighs)
"
957,"
"
958,"- I have a right as their father. Please?
"
959,"- All right. Anything else you wanna see?
"
960,"
"
961,"- Are you offering?
"
962,"- Not any more.
"
963,"
"
964,"What's the change?
"
965,"
"
966,"- Are you guys all right?
"
967,"- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.
"
968,"
"
969,"Ugh!
"
970,"
"
971,"Miranda, why not let me
"
972,"take care of the kids?
"
973,"
"
974,"I'll pick 'em up after school, be with them,
"
975,"then drop them off at your house after work.
"
976,"
"
977,"- That'd be great!
"
978,"- Please!
"
979,"
"
980,"- Look. The kids love it.
"
981,"- Mommy, please!
"
982,"
"
983,"I'll think about it.
"
984,"
"
985,"We're his goddamn kids, too.
"
986,"
"
987,"Kids say the darndest things.
"
988,"
"
989,"Thank you. Any other choice phrases
"
990,"you'd like to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?
"
991,"
"
992,"Oh...! Come on,
"
993,"everybody get their coats. Come on.
"
994,"
"
995,"- Put them on and let's get out of here.
"
996,"- OK, Mom.
"
997,"
"
998,"I would say go to the bathroom before we go,
"
999,"but I don't think that's a good idea.
"
1000,"
"
1001,"Don't forget anything.
"
1002,"I don't wanna come back.
"
1003,"
"
1004,"Come on, let's go.
"
1005,"
"
1006,"- See you Saturday.
"
1007,"- Say goodbye to your father.
"
1008,"
"
1009,"Goodbye, Daddy.

"
1024,"- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.
"
1025,"
"
1026,"- In a band?
"
1027,"- I just wanna know one thing.
"
1028,"
"
1029,"Are your kids well-behaved, or do they need,
"
1030,"like, a few light slams every now and then?
"
1031,"
"
1032,"- Um... I'll have to get back to you.
"
1033,"-Wow!

1067,"
"
1068,"Let's go in for the kill.
"
1069,"

"
1071,"
"
1072,"- Hello?
"
1073,"- (as Scottish woman) Hello.
"
1074,"
"
1075,"I'm calling in regards
"
1076,"to the ad I read in the paper.
"
1077,"
"
1078,"Yes... Well, would you tell me
"
1079,"a little bit about yourself?
"
1080,"
"
1081,"Oh, certainly, dear.
"
1082,"
"
1083,"For the past 15 years I've worked for
"
1084,"the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.
"
1085,"
"
1086,"That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.
"
1087,"
"
1088,"And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,
"
1089,"and took care of their four glorious children.
"
1090,"
"
1091,"Oh, I grew quite attached to them after 15
"
1092,"years, but they grew up, as children tend to.
"
1093,"
"
1094,"Oh, but listen to me. I am going on when you
"
1095,"should be telling me about your little ones.
"
1096,"
"
1097,"- Well, I have two girls...
"
1098,"- Oh, two precious gems.
"
1099,"
"
1100,"No doubt the jewel of your eye.
"
1101,"
"
1102,"- And one boy.
"
1103,"- Oh, the little prince. How wonderful.
"
1104,"
"
1105,"I must tell you,
"
1106,"a little light cooking is required.
"
1107,"
"
1108,"Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
"
1109,"I'd love some heavy cooking.
"
1110,"
"
1111,"But I do have one rule: they'll only eat
"
1112,"good, nutritious food with me.
"
1113,"
"
1114,"And if there's any dispute, it's either
"
1115,"good, wholesome food or empty tummies.
"
1116,"
"
1117,"That's my rule.
"
1118,"I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.
"
1119,"
"
1120,"No! Um...
"
1121,"
"
1122,"Would you mind coming on an interview?
"
1123,"Say, Monday night at 7.30?
"
1124,"
"
1125,"- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
"
1126,"- Wonderful.
"
1127,"
"
1128,"I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.
"
1129,"
"
1130,"Steiner. Oh, how lovely.
"
1131,"
"
1132,"- Could you tell me your name?
"
1133,"- My name?
"
1134,"
"
1135,"I thought I gave it to you, dear.
"
1136,"
"
1137,"- No.
"
1138,"- Oh!
"
1139,"
"
1140,"- Doubtfire.
"
1141,"- I beg your pardon?
"
1142,"
"
1143,"Doubtfire, dear. Mrs Doubtfire.
"
1144,"
"
1145,"- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
"
1146,"- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.
"
1147,"
"
1148,"- Bye-bye.
"
1149,"- Ta-ta.
"
1150,"
"
1151,"Showtime.
"
1152,"(chuckles)
"
1153,"
"
1154,"- Daniel, hi.
"
1155,"- Could you make me a woman?
"
1156,"
"
1157,"Honey, I'm so happy!
"
1158,"
"
1159,"- Oh, come here.
"
1160,"- I knew you'd understand.
"
1161,"
"
1162,"- Is this gonna hurt?
"
1163,"- Don't whine. Just relax.
"
1164,"
"
1165,"- Are you sure?
"
1166,"- Just remember, pain is beauty.
"
1167,"
"
1168,"- OK, take a deep breath... lnstant eye lift.
"
1169,"- Whoa.
"
1170,"
"
1171,"And the strings are under the wig.
"
1172,"
"
1173,"- The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
"
1174,"- All right, we'll start with make-up.
"
1175,"
"
1176,"- I'm not gonna wax.
"
1177,"- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.
"
1178,"
"
1179,"- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
"
1180,"- You look like her mother.
"
1181,"
"
1182,"(as Gloria Swanson)
"
1183,"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.
"
1184,"
"
1185,"OK, everyone... Let's pray.
"
1186,"
"
1187,"(Spanish accent) I hope you are using
"
1188,"Jungle Red. That is the colour I love.
"
1189,"
"
1190,"- Matches your lips.
"
1191,"- God bless you.
"
1192,"
"
1193,"I'm feeling fabulous
"
1194,"because I met this beautiful Cuban.
"
1195,"
"
1196,"Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.
"
1197,"
"
1198,"I can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.
"
1199,"
"
1200,"I don't know. This would scare the children.
"
1201,"Maybe this is too much for them.
"
1202,"
"
1203,"I think we have to go to the next level.
"
1204,"
"
1205,"Latex.
"
1206,"
"
1207,"(Yiddish accent)
"
1208,"Oy, it was such a shandeh.
"
1209,"
"
1210,"I should never buy gribbenes from a mohel.
"
1211,"It's so chewy.
"
1212,"
"
1213,"- No, I feel like Bubbee. This is not working.
"
1214,"- Don't worry.
"
1215,"
"
1216,"It's a work in progress and you're my brother.
"
1217,"I will never let you be embarrassed.
"
1218,"
"
1219,"- God bless you.
"
1220,"- We'll have to do the entire face.
"
1221,"
"
1222,"But look at this nice thing we have here.
"
1223,"
"
1224,"Matchmaker, matchmaker,
"
1225,"make me a match
"
1226,"
"
1227,"Find me a find, catch me a catch
"
1228,"
"
1229,"Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter
"
1230,"
"
1231,"Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
"
1232,"
"
1233,"Don't bring around a cloud
"
1234,"to rain on my parade
"
1235,"
"
1236,"It's not working. I need to go older.
"
1237,"
"
1238,"Older? Like Shelley Winters older
"
1239,"or Shirley MacLaine older?
"
1240,"
"
1241,"- What's the difference?
"
1242,"- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.
"
1243,"
"
1244,"- What about Joan Collins?
"
1245,"- Oh, I don't think I have the strength.
"
1246,"
"
1247,"But I have some plaster.

"
1276,"
"
1277,"Tonight!
"
1278,"
"
1279,"(Nattie)
"
1280,"That's disgusting!
"

"
1282,"- The most revolting thing I've ever seen.
"
1283,"- (doorbell)
"
1284,"
"
1285,"Awesome.
"
1286,"
"
1287,"What is this? Turn it off, will you?
"
1288,"
"
1289,"Come on. I want you
"
1290,"to meet this lady with me.
"
1291,"
"
1292,"I want you to be polite to her, then...
"
1293,"tell me what you think.
"
1294,"
"
1295,"Everybody stand over here
"
1296,"and help me decide what to do.
"
1297,"
"
1298,"Hello. Mrs Hillard, I presume.
"
1299,"
"
1300,"Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.
"
1301,"
"
1302,"Euphegenia Doubtfire.
"
1303,"
"
1304,"Yes. Won't you please come in?
"
1305,"
"
1306,"Thank you, dear.
"
1307,"
"
1308,"- And these must be the cherubs.
"
1309,"- Yes.
"
1310,"
"
1311,"- This is Natalie.
"
1312,"- Oh, hello, Natalie.
"
1313,"
"
1314,"- Are you wearing bug spray?
"
1315,"- Nattie!
"
1316,"
"
1317,"It's quite all right, dear. No offence taken.
"
1318,"I was a little liberal with the atomiser.
"
1319,"
"
1320,"And at my age, it's like a good Stilton.
"
1321,"Everything has its own aroma.
"
1322,"
"
1323,"I admire that honesty, Nattie.
"
1324,"That's a noble quality. Never lose that,...
"
1325,"
"
1326,"..because it often disappears with age
"
1327,"or entering politics.
"
1328,"
"
1329,"Look at that face.
"
1330,"You remind me of Stuart Little,...
"
1331,"
"
1332,"..one of the most honourable creatures
"
1333,"in all of literature.
"
1334,"
"
1335,"- Do you know that book, 'Stuart Little'?
"
1336,"- Yeah! It's one of my favourites.
"
1337,"
"
1338,"Mine, too! Maybe I could read it to you -
"
1339,"if I get the position.
"
1340,"
"
1341,"- That would be wonderful.
"
1342,"- And who is this strapping young lad?
"
1343,"
"
1344,"- This is Chris.
"
1345,"- Hello, Christopher.
"
1346,"
"
1347,"Hello.
"
1348,"
"
1349,"Jeez, you're big for a lady.
"
1350,"You could play for the 49ers.
"
1351,"
"
1352,"Well, I was a fullback.
"
1353,"But that's European football, dear.
"
1354,"
"
1355,"- Soccer?
"
1356,"- Yes. You play soccer, too?
"
1357,"
"
1358,"- Yeah!
"
1359,"- Oh, isn't that amazing?
"
1360,"
"
1361,"Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
"
1362,"We won three university championships.
"
1363,"
"
1364,"Oh, but that was decades ago!
"
1365,"
"
1366,"But I was more disciplined then. I always
"
1367,"put my studies ahead of my athletics.
"
1368,"
"
1369,"I'm sure you're the same
"
1370,"and you've done all your homework already.
"
1371,"
"
1372,"- Well, not exactly.
"
1373,"- Really? Oh. That's a pity.
"
1374,"
"
1375,"Young men who don't do their studies
"
1376,"often miss out on more amusing activities.
"
1377,"
"
1378,"- And who is this young lady?
"
1379,"- This is Lydia.
"
1380,"
"
1381,"Hello, Lydia.
"
1382,"
"
1383,"This isn't fair, Mom.
"
1384,"Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?
"
1385,"
"
1386,"- This is all I need.
"
1387,"- Why can't Dad do it?
"
1388,"
"
1389,"Dear, I don't think it's appropriate to argue
"
1390,"with your mother in front of a stranger.
"
1391,"
"
1392,"I just don't see why
"
1393,"we can't spend the extra time with Dad.
"
1394,"
"
1395,"Maybe she's right, dear. Maybe their father
"
1396,"would be a more appropriate person.
"
1397,"
"
1398,"No, I don't think so.
"
1399,"
"
1400,"It's not my fault, honey. If he would
"
1401,"get ajob and a decent apartment...
"
1402,"
"
1403,"- You see, he's the kind...
"
1404,"- Excuse me, dear.
"
1405,"
"
1406,"I'm sure you'd want the children
"
1407,"to step out of the room...
"
1408,"
"
1409,"..before you verbally bash their father. Hm?
"
1410,"
"
1411,"If I did that, I might never see them again.
"
1412,"
"
1413,"- I'm sorry. You're right.
"
1414,"- No harm done.
"
1415,"
"
1416,"- You're absolutely right.
"
1417,"- I'm not a therapist. I just see what I see.
"
1418,"
"
1419,"Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
"
1420,"I'll be up in a minute.
"
1421,"
"
1422,"- It's lovely to meet you.
"
1423,"- Yeah, nice to meet you.
"
1424,"
"
1425,"You too, Lydie.
"
1426,"
"
1427,"- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
"
1428,"- Yes.
"
1429,"
"
1430,"- Especially Lydie. She's got daggers for you.
"
1431,"- I know.
"
1432,"
"
1433,"- They're very upset with me right now.
"
1434,"- Probably the divorce.
"
1435,"
"
1436,"How did you know?
"
1437,"
"
1438,"You can sense it, dear -
"
1439,"the way she talks about her father.
"
1440,"
"
1441,"I don't think he's in the Navy, the way she's
"
1442,"saying she misses him. It's like he's nearby.
"
1443,"
"
1444,"- Yes.
"
1445,"- Oh, that's so sad.
"
1446,"
"
1447,"- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
"
1448,"- I'd love that.
"
1449,"
"
1450,"- It's right in here.
"
1451,"- What a lovely home you have.
"
1452,"
"
1453,"- Did you decorate this yourself?
"
1454,"- Yes, I did.
"
1455,"
"
1456,"Oh, it reeks of taste! Isn't this lovely, dear!
"
1457,"
"
1458,"- Here's my ré'sumé'.
"
1459,"- Oh. Thank you.
"
1460,"
"
1461,"- Let me start this tea.
"
1462,"- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.
"
1463,"
"
1464,"You've had a hard day. You just sit yourself
"
1465,"down on that stool and leave the tea to me.
"
1466,"
"
1467,"Thank you. That's very nice of you.
"
1468,"
"
1469,"Oh, not at all, dear.
"
1470,"
"
1471,"- Oh. What a wonderful ré'sumé'.
"
1472,"- Thank you, dear.
"
1473,"
"
1474,"""Expert in first aid and CPR.""
"
1475,"
"
1476,"And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.
"
1477,"
"
1478,"You can never be too prepared
"
1479,"when little ones are around.
"
1480,"
"
1481,"They'll swallow anything.
"
1482,"You've got to be ready to pop it out.
"
1483,"
"
1484,"Oh, let's see.
"
1485,"
"
1486,"Oh! What a perfectly appointed little cubby!
"
1487,"
"
1488,"Look at this. Everything
"
1489,"has its place and name tag.
"
1490,"
"
1491,"How precise! It's lovely.
"
1492,"
"
1493,"My husband never appreciated it.
"
1494,"
"
1495,"Oh. Poor dolt.
"
1496,"
"
1497,"That's not the reason
"
1498,"you divorced him, was it?
"
1499,"
"
1500,"No.
"
1501,"
"
1502,"It's so sad, because marriage
"
1503,"can be such a blessing.
"
1504,"
"
1505,"- So can divorce.
"
1506,"- Oh.
"
1507,"
"
1508,"Daniel is a... very difficult man to live with.
"
1509,"But the children are crazy about him.
"
1510,"
"
1511,"You don't have to be a psychic to sense that.
"
1512,"
"
1513,"My, you certainly do know your way
"
1514,"around a kitchen!
"
1515,"
"
1516,"Oh! Uh...
"
1517,"
"
1518,"It's just because everything is so accessible.
"
1519,"You designed it.
"
1520,"
"
1521,"I'm amazed there isn't a little label there
"
1522,"that says ""spoons"".
"
1523,"
"
1524,"You remind me of someone.
"
1525,"
"
1526,"Really? Who?
"
1527,"
"
1528,"I feel like I've known you for years.
"
1529,"
"
1530,"Maybe we knew each other in another life.
"
1531,"(chuckles)
"
1532,"
"
1533,"I would love for you
"
1534,"to come and work with us.
"
1535,"
"
1536,"- So would l.
"
1537,"- Great!
"
1538,"
"
1539,"It would be an honour.
"
1540,"
"
1541,"To us.
"
1542,"
"
1543,"To us. The start of a business relationship.
"
1544,"
"
1545,"(mutters and curses)
"
1546,"
"
1547,"Good evening, dear.
"
1548,"
"
1549,"Evening, ma'am.
"
1550,"
"
1551,"Cold night, isn't it?
"
1552,"
"
1553,"Yes, it is.
"
1554,"
"
1555,"Hope you have somethin' nice and warm
"
1556,"to go home to.
"
1557,"
"
1558,"(as Daniel)
"
1559,"My back.
"
1560,"
"
1561,"Jesus! If I find the misogynistic bastard
"
1562,"that invented heels, I'll kill him.
"
1563,"
"
1564,"God...!
"
1565,"
"
1566,"Excuse me.
"
1567,"
"
1568,"Mrs Sellner!
"
1569,"
"
1570,"Have we met?
"
1571,"
"
1572,"No. But Danny's told me all about you.
"
1573,"
"
1574,"I'm his sister.
"
1575,"
"
1576,"His... much older sister.
"
1577,"
"
1578,"- You have his eyes.
"
1579,"- Only if he fills out a donor card.
"
1580,"
"
1581,"(chuckles)
"
1582,"
"
1583,"- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
"
1584,"- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.
"
1585,"
"
1586,"Let me go up and get him
"
1587,"and he'll be right down.
"
1588,"
"
1589,"- I'll come with you.
"
1590,"- No.
"
1591,"
"
1592,"- Yes.
"
1593,"- Why?
"
1594,"
"
1595,"Because I have an appointment on Monday
"
1596,"and Friday evenings to check the apartment.
"
1597,"
"
1598,"I remember him saying something about that.
"
1599,"
"
1600,"Are you sure, dear?
"
1601,"It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.
"
1602,"
"
1603,"- If you can do it, I can.
"
1604,"- I'll bet so!
"
1605,"
"
1606,"- Is your ticker all right?
"
1607,"- Topnotch.
"
1608,"
"
1609,"Oh, good! Cos I don't want
"
1610,"to jump-start ya. (chuckles)
"
1611,"
"
1612,"Damn door.
"
1613,"
"
1614,"Come in, please, dear. Sorry about that.
"
1615,"
"
1616,"Here we are. Daniel's abode.
"
1617,"
"
1618,"Oh, that's mine, dear.
"
1619,"I'm a messy house guest.
"
1620,"
"
1621,"Well, just make yourself at home.
"
1622,"I'll be right back.
"
1623,"
"
1624,"He'll be back. I'll go get him.
"
1625,"
"

1627,"
"
1628,"Danny boy, where are you?
"
1629,"Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.
"
1630,"
"
1631,"Danny, there's a Mrs Sellner here to see you!
"
1632,"
"
1633,"-(as Daniel) Oh, is she here?
"
1634,"- Yes, she is.
"
1635,"
"
1636,"(as Daniel) Mrs Sellner,
"
1637,"I just got out of the shower!
"
1638,"
"
1639,"I think you'll be very pleased with me!
"
1640,"
"
1641,"I've been through
"
1642,"some really interesting changes!
"
1643,"
"
1644,"And I'm becoming a new man
"
1645,"and a model father!
"
1646,"
"
1647,"He'll be right there. He's just changing, dear.
"
1648,"
"
1649,"(as Daniel) I want to keep you abreast
"
1650,"of the changes in my career!
"
1651,"
"
1652,"There have been two big developments!
"
1653,"I'm finally starting to come into my own!
"
1654,"
"
1655,"Things are really starting to take shape,
"
1656,"and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!
"
1657,"
"
1658,"Things were hairy for a while,...
"
1659,"
"
1660,"..but oh! I'm in great shape now!
"
1661,"
"
1662,"I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!
"
1663,"
"
1664,"A job I could really sink my teeth into!
"
1665,"
"
1666,"I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!
"
1667,"
"
1668,"So nice I don't have to
"
1669,"save face any more, Mrs Sellner!
"
1670,"
"
1671,"- (shrieks)
"
1672,"- Mrs Sellner! How are you? Always ajoy!
"
1673,"
"
1674,"If you wanted some cheese,
"
1675,"why didn't you just say so?
"
1676,"
"
1677,"Well, you'll be happy to know
"
1678,"that I now am holding down two jobs.
"
1679,"
"
1680,"One for an educational film and TV company
"
1681,"-heavy responsibility.
"
1682,"
"
1683,"- And the other?
"
1684,"- Cleaning houses. Not mine.
"
1685,"
"
1686,"- Big girl!
"
1687,"- Your sister is English?
"
1688,"
"
1689,"She's half-English, half-American.
"
1690,"
"
1691,"Half-sister, really. That makes her
"
1692,"an eighth English? I've never done the math.
"
1693,"
"
1694,"Let me see, my father was American.
"
1695,"He... flew for the English during the war.
"
1696,"
"
1697,"He was in London and...
"
1698,"he met this lovely Englishwoman.
"
1699,"
"
1700,"Well, my sister was the fruit of their passions.
"
1701,"
"
1702,"- (shrieks)
"
1703,"- Sorry. My sister's, not yours.
"
1704,"
"
1705,"You see, she's not a very good housekeeper.
"
1706,"But she makes a fabulous cup of English tea.
"
1707,"
"
1708,"Really? Well, I would adore
"
1709,"a good cup of English tea.
"
1710,"
"
1711,"Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

1748,"
"
1749,"- Two, please!
"
1750,"- Tea, sugar, hot water.
"
1751,"
"
1752,"You got it - argh!

"
1770,"- Oh, no, dear! I don't need a hand.
"
1771,"
"
1772,"(mutters)
"
1773,"I need a face. A face.
"
1774,"
"
1775,"- Are you sure?
"
1776,"- Oh, definitely!
"
1777,"
"

"
2242,"I have a home in London. I was born there.

2244,"
"
2245,"- Here and there, dear. All over, really.
"
2246,"- Yes?
"
2247,"
"

"
2258,"Off your Mercedes, dear?
"
2259,"You own that big, expensive car out there?

2262,"who has to buy a big car like that...
"
2263,"
"
2264,"..is compensating for smaller genitals.
"
2265,"
"
2266,"But not in your case, cos I see
"
2267,"that you're a strapping lad, aren't ya?
"
2268,"
"

"
2270,"- You too, dear.
"
2271,"
"
2272,"- Mrs Doubtfire, may I speak with you?
"
2273,"- Ooh, certainly, dear.
"
2274,"
"
2275,"Could you stay
"
2276,"a few extra hours this evening?
"
2277,"
"
2278,"Stu. That's more of a thick soup
"
2279,"than a name, really.
"
2280,"
"
2281,"It's a name. It's short for Stuart.
"
2282,"
"
2283,"- Is it?
"
2284,"- Yes. He's a client. And a friend.
"
2285,"
"
2286,"- He was a friend. He is a friend.
"
2287,"- What is he?
"
2288,"
"
2289,"- I don't know what's happening.
"
2290,"- What is it, dear?
"
2291,"
"
2292,"- Isn't he fabulous?
"
2293,"- Oh... kind of, dear,...
"
2294,"
"
2295,"..if you like that handsome, rugged type.
"
2296,"
"
2297,"But personally I prefer short, furry and funny.
"
2298,"
"
2299,"He just wants to go out and have a drink.
"
2300,"
"
2301,"- I think that's pretty harmless. Don't you?
"
2302,"- Absolutely not, dear.
"
2303,"
"
2304,"- They always have other intentions.
"
2305,"- This is business, mostly.
"
2306,"
"
2307,"I'll just sip club soda
"
2308,"and we'll go over wallpaper samples.

2309,"

2310,"Dear Miranda. Wake up
"
2311,"and smell the coffee, dear.
"
2312,"
"
2313,"Can't you see the lust in that man's eyes?
"
2314,"
"
2315,"It's too soon, dear. Really.
"
2316,"

2317,"You've got to give your divorce time.
"
2318,"
"
2319,"Let your sheets cool down before you bring

2321,"
"
2322,"Mrs Doubtfire, may I ask you a question?
"
2323,"
"
2324,"Certainly, dear.
"
2325,"
"
2326,"How long after Mr Doubtfire passed away...
"
2327,"
"
2328,"- Winston.
"
2329,"- Winston.
"
2330,"
"
2331,"..did you feel any... desire...
"
2332,"
"
2333,"- Never.
"
2334,"- Never?
"
2335,"
"
2336,"- Never again.
"
2337,"- Never again?
"
2338,"
"
2339,"Once the father of your children
"
2340,"is out of the picture,...

2587,"- I can't believe it.
"
2588,"- What, dear?

"
2591,"living with him pretending to be his sister!
"
2592,"

2630,"Eight years ago, dear. This November.
"
2631,"

2632,"What happened?
"
2633,"
"
2634,"- He was quite fond of the drink.
"
2635,"- Ah.
"
2636,"
"
2637,"- It was the drink that killed him.
"
2638,"- How awful.
"
2639,"
"
2640,"- He was an alcoholic?
"
2641,"- No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.

2642,"

2659,"- Surely you don't mean that, dear?
"

2661,"- Well...
"
2662,"- Oh, that's so sweet!
"
2663,"
"
2664,"You can't imagine what it was like
"
2665,"being married to Daniel.
"
2666,"
"
2667,"Tell me, dear. What was so horrible
"
2668,"about this man you lived with for 14 years?
"
2669,"
"
2670,"Well, at first, nothing.
"
2671,"
"
2672,"He was... He was so... romantic.
"
2673,"
"
2674,"- So passionate.
"
2675,"- Really?
"
2676,"
"
2677,"He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.

2678,"
"
2679,"I hope you don't mind me
"
2680,"being a tad rude, but...
"
2681,"
"
2682,"..how was he... you know...
"
2683,"on a scale of 1 to 10?
"
2684,"
"
2685,"Oh, well. That part was always...
"
2686,"
"
2687,"..OK.

2688,"

2693,"
"
2694,"- What was the matter with Winston?
"
2695,"- Oh, dear.
"
2696,"
"
2697,"Winston's idea of foreplay was
"
2698,"""Effie, brace yourself.""
"
2699,"
"
2700,"It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy
"
2701,"I fell in love with.
"
2702,"
"
2703,"Really?
"
2704,"
"
2705,"Everyone else I knew
"
2706,"was so organised, so scheduled.
"
2707,"
"
2708,"Like me, I guess.
"
2709,"
"
2710,"But Daniel was so wonderfully different.
"
2711,"And funny. He could always make me laugh.
"
2712,"
"
2713,"I always say:
"
2714,"the key to a solid marriage is laughter.
"
2715,"
"
2716,"But after a few years,
"
2717,"everything just stopped being funny.
"
2718,"
"
2719,"- Why?
"
2720,"- I was working all the time and...
"
2721,"
"
2722,"..he was always between jobs.
"
2723,"I hardly ever got to see the kids, and...
"
2724,"
"
2725,"..if I got home early to be with them,
"
2726,"something would go wrong.
"
2727,"
"
2728,"The house would be wrecked
"
2729,"and I'd have to clean it up.
"
2730,"
"
2731,"He never knew, but so many nights I just...
"
2732,"cried myself to sleep.
"
2733,"
"
2734,"Really?
"
2735,"
"
2736,"The truth is, I didn't like who I was
"
2737,"when I was with him.
"
2738,"
"
2739,"I would turn into this horrible person.
"
2740,"
"
2741,"I didn't want my kids growing up
"
2742,"with a mother like that.
"
2743,"
"
2744,"When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.
"
2745,"
"
2746,"And... I'm sure he's better
"
2747,"when he's not with me.
"
2748,"
"
2749,"Well, you never...
"
2750,"
"
2751,"I mean... Did you ever
"
2752,"say anything to him, dear?
"
2753,"
"
2754,"Daniel never liked
"
2755,"to talk about anything serious.
"
2756,"
"
2757,"I used to think Daniel could do anything...
"
2758,"except be serious.
"
2759,"
"
2760,"But then, I was serious enough
"
2761,"for everybody.
"
2762,"
"
2763,"- Oh!
"
2764,"-(Nattie) This is great!
"
2765,"
"
2766,"(Mrs Doubtfire)
"
2767,"Isn't this posh!
"
2768,"
"
2769,"I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably need
"
2770,"a credit reference just to get in the pool.
"
2771,"
"
2772,"- Amazing!
"
2773,"- Oh, Nattie.
"
2774,"
"
2775,"Not a single body
"
2776,"that exists in nature. Look at that.
"
2777,"
"
2778,"- Lydie...
"
2779,"- There's Stu!
"
2780,"
"
2781,"(Mrs Doubtfire)
"
2782,"Where? Oh. On the board.
"
2783,"
"
2784,"Oh, isn't he a stunning piece of work?
"
2785,"
"
2786,"Look, Nattie. That's called liposuction.
"
2787,"
"
2788,"(Miranda laughs)
"
2789,"Wow!
"
2790,"
"
2791,"I hope he had protection,
"
2792,"hitting the water at that speed.
"
2793,"
"
2794,"- Let's go say hi.
"
2795,"- Let's do, please.
"
2796,"
"
2797,"- Wow! That's amazing.
"
2798,"- Stunning.
"
2799,"
"
2800,"- Hello! You look lovely!
"
2801,"- Hi.
"
2802,"
"
2803,"Oh, guys, I'm so glad you could make it.
"
2804,"
"
2805,"- By the looks of you, that water's so cold!
"
2806,"- Yes, well...
"
2807,"
"
2808,"Your tummy looks different from my daddy's.
"
2809,"
"
2810,"Oh, Nattie! Not everyone has
"
2811,"their own personal trainer.
"
2812,"
"
2813,"- Got your swimsuits? Wanna go for a dip?
"
2814,"- That'd be great!
"
2815,"
"
2816,"- Good! How about you, Mrs Doubtfire?
"
2817,"- Oh, you wicked, wicked man!
"
2818,"
"
2819,"Isn't there enough flesh here
"
2820,"for you to feast your eyes on?
"
2821,"
"
2822,"- Come, Mrs Doubtfire. Don't be bashful.
"
2823,"- No, dear. They've outlawed whaling.
"
2824,"
"
2825,"- We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.
"
2826,"- Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.
"
2827,"
"
2828,"Oh, no. Just go. Leave me here.
"
2829,"I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.
"
2830,"
"
2831,"You can't get heatstroke
"
2832,"twice in the same year.
"
2833,"
"
2834,"OK. Well, let's go, kids. Swim time.
"
2835,"
"
2836,"- Go, dear. I'll be fine.
"
2837,"- Your day's on me, Mrs Doubtfire.
"
2838,"
"
2839,"- Anything you need, put it on my tab.
"
2840,"- Thank you, dear.
"
2841,"
"
2842,"Touch me again and
"
2843,"I'll drown you, you bastard.
"
2844,"
"
2845,"I'll just sit here and watch you
"
2846,"move in on my family.
"
2847,"
"
2848,"Hello, hello.
"
2849,"
"
2850,"Oh, God. What am I doing here?
"
2851,"This is beyond obsession.
"
2852,"
"
2853,"Oh, God...
"
2854,"
"
2855,"( steel band plays ""Yellow Bird"")
"
2856,"
"
2857,"(belches)
"
2858,"
"
2859,"- Is everything all right, ma'am?
"
2860,"- (drunkenly) Fan-bloody-tastic.
"
2861,"
"
2862,"- Can I have another?
"
2863,"- Sure.
"
2864,"
"
2865,"Great.
"
2866,"
"
2867,"- Hi.
"
2868,"- Soda with a lime, please.
"
2869,"
"
2870,"- It's on me.
"
2871,"- No, thanks.
"
2872,"
"
2873,"Four iced teas, Todd.
"
2874,"
"
2875,"So, whose rugrats?
"
2876,"
"
2877,"Miranda Hillard's.
"
2878,"
"
2879,"- Miranda Hillard?
"
2880,"- Mm-hm. The woman I'm seeing.
"
2881,"
"
2882,"No kidding? You?
"
2883,"The guy who's never having kids?
"
2884,"
"
2885,"Won't have anything to do with kids?
"
2886,"You won't even date a woman with kids.
"
2887,"
"
2888,"People change, Ron.
"
2889,"
"
2890,"I'm pushing 40. I don't want to
"
2891,"spend the rest of my life by myself.
"
2892,"
"
2893,"She's got an awful lot of baggage. Three kids.
"
2894,"
"
2895,"Three terrific kids, and I'm crazy about them.
"
2896,"Especially little Natalie. Look at her.
"
2897,"
"
2898,"She's a sweetie pie.
"
2899,"
"
2900,"God knows they need a stable father figure
"
2901,"in their life right now.
"
2902,"
"
2903,"- What about their real father?
"
2904,"- What can I say? The guy's a loser. I'll see ya.
"
2905,"
"
2906,"(to himself)
"
2907,"Loser? Oh, yeah?
"
2908,"
"
2909,"Oh, sir!
"
2910,"
"
2911,"I saw it! Some angry member
"
2912,"of the kitchen staff. Did you not tip them?
"
2913,"
"
2914,"Oh, the terrorists! They ran that way.
"
2915,"It was a run-by fruiting.
"
2916,"
"
2917,"I'll get them, sir. Don't worry.
"
2918,"
"
2919,"(angry grunt)
"
2920,"
"
2921,"Oh... Oh...
"
2922,"
"
2923,"Good waste ofjuice.
"
2924,"
"
2925,"(as Daniel)
"
2926,"Loser.
"
2927,"
"
2928,"(as Daniel)
"
2929,"What are you lookin' at?
"
2930,"
"
2931,"(whistles tentatively)
"
2932,"
"
2933,"(as Mr Rogers)
"
2934,"Hi, boys and girls.
"
2935,"
"
2936,"Today we'll be talking about dinosaurs.
"

"
2939,"It's... A Dinosaurus Line!
"
2940,"
"
2941,"( hums brassy intro)
"
2942,"
"
2943,"And please welcome... the king!
"
2944,"
"
2945,"( hums show tune)
"
2946,"
"
2947,"It's a dinner show. Hi! Where you from?
"
2948,"I'm gonna make you lunch.
"
2949,"
"
2950,"- (as Elvis) Thank you very much.
"
2951,"- Thank you! All right!
"
2952,"
"
2953,"Ladies and gentlemen,
"
2954,"put your claws together!
"
2955,"
"
2956,"Please welcome... James Browntosaurus!
"
2957,"
"
2958,"( hums intro to ""I Feel Good"")
"
2959,"
"
2960,"I eat wood, di-na di-na di-na din
"
2961,"
"
2962,"It tastes good, di-na di-na di-na din
"
2963,"
"
2964,"No meat, big feet
"
2965,"
"
2966,"I eat wood - pum pum pum pum! Ow!
"
2967,"
"
2968,"Oh, I got to help myself!
"
2969,"Can't go on! I'm goin' extinct!
"
2970,"
"
2971,"Oh, thank you, James. But right now - yo!
"
2972,"It's time for the Raptor Rap!
"
2973,"
"
2974,"I'm a raptor, doin' what I can
"
2975,"
"
2976,"Gonna eat everything
"
2977,"till the appearance of man
"
2978,"
"
2979,"Yo, yo, see me, I'm livin' below the soil
"
2980,"
"
2981,"I'll be back but I'm comin' as oil
"
2982,"
"
2983,"Very impressive, Mr Hillard!
"
2984,"
"
2985,"- I didn't know anybody was watching.
"
2986,"- I was watching. That's funny stuff.
"
2987,"
"
2988,"- Well, thanks.
"
2989,"- I think kids'd like it.
"
2990,"
"
2991,"- They'd be entertained and get information.
"
2992,"- That's kinda my theory.
"
2993,"
"
2994,"You don't have to play down to 'em,
"
2995,"just play to 'em.
"
2996,"
"
2997,"- Listen, I'd like to hear more of your ideas.
"
2998,"- My ideas?
"
2999,"
"
3000,"- How about a dinner meeting?
"
3001,"- Wow. OK.
"
3002,"
"
3003,"Next Friday. Bridges Restaurant.
"
3004,"Seven o'clock sharp.
"
3005,"
"
3006,"I'll be there.
"
3007,"
"
3008,"Take five.
"
3009,"
"
3010,"Take five million. You're dead.
"
3011,"
"
3012,"(Daniel) We've just had our first
"
3013,"home-cooked meal. I'm domestic now, huh?
"
3014,"
"
3015,"- (Chris) This is terrific, Dad.
"
3016,"- You want more spaghetti?
"
3017,"
"
3018,"- No, I'm stuffed.
"
3019,"- Garlic bread? I made it myself.
"
3020,"
"
3021,"Well, I didn't make it myself.
"
3022,"I cooked it. I sliced it.
"
3023,"
"
3024,"It's OK, Dad. Thanks.
"
3025,"
"
3026,"The place looks great. The food's terrific.
"
3027,"
"
3028,"I'm really proud of you.
"
3029,"
"
3030,"Yeah. Me, too.
"
3031,"
"
3032,"Me, too.
"
3033,"
"
3034,"(knocking on door)
"
3035,"
"
3036,"I'll be right back.
"
3037,"
"
3038,"- Thank you for knocking.
"
3039,"- Yeah.
"
3040,"
"
3041,"Whoa! Look at this!
"
3042,"
"
3043,"I see you got someone to clean for you.
"
3044,"
"
3045,"- No.
"
3046,"- You...?
"
3047,"
"
3048,"- Hi, guys.
"
3049,"- Hi, Mom.
"
3050,"
"
3051,"- Are they ready?
"
3052,"- No. They haven't had dessert yet.
"
3053,"
"
3054,"- You cooked?
"
3055,"- Yes. I cook, I bake, I sew.
"
3056,"
"
3057,"Thanks to this Amish
"
3058,"home study course I'm doing.
"
3059,"
"
3060,"- I'm very impressed.
"
3061,"- Really?
"
3062,"
"
3063,"Give me a second chance. OK?
"
3064,"Let me take the kids after school.
"
3065,"
"
3066,"- I can't get rid of Mrs Doubtfire. She's terrific.
"
3067,"- Why not?
"
3068,"
"
3069,"She's the best thing that ever happened to us.
"
3070,"
"
3071,"The kids are all doing better in school.
"
3072,"Chris is passing every single subject.
"
3073,"
"
3074,"I find myself getting home early
"
3075,"just to be with them. We're all doing so great.
"
3076,"
"
3077,"Whooh! Sounds like an amazing woman.
"
3078,"Too good to be true.
"
3079,"
"
3080,"She is.
"
3081,"
"
3082,"- I kinda like the black one.
"
3083,"- Me, too.
"
3084,"
"
3085,"I don't know. Actually... Mrs Doubtfire!
"
3086,"
"
3087,"- Yes?
"
3088,"- We need another woman's opinion.
"
3089,"
"
3090,"Oh! Then I'm your woman.
"
3091,"
"
3092,"- Which one?
"
3093,"- What's the occasion?
"
3094,"
"
3095,"- It's my birthday.
"
3096,"- Oh!
"
3097,"
"
3098,"- Stu's taking me out to dinner.
"
3099,"- Oh...
"
3100,"
"
3101,"- Neither.
"
3102,"- Neither?
"
3103,"
"
3104,"They're both too brazen, dear.
"
3105,"They cry ""harlot"".
"
3106,"
"
3107,"Red is the traditional colour for streetwalkers.
"
3108,"
"
3109,"And the black one is far too short.
"
3110,"I hope you waxed.
"
3111,"
"
3112,"They both say to me ""I'm easy.""
"
3113,"
"
3114,"You want to be Kilimanjaro
"
3115,"on your first date - inaccessible.
"
3116,"
"
3117,"Why buy the cow
"
3118,"when you can get the milk for free?
"
3119,"
"
3120,"No, let's find something more your own age.
"
3121,"
"
3122,"Something a little less tawdry.
"
3123,"
"
3124,"Let's see.
"
3125,"
"
3126,"How about this lovely frock?
"
3127,"Tasteful, elegant...
"
3128,"
"
3129,"Don't you think?
"
3130,"
"
3131,"And old. I wore that
"
3132,"to my aunt's funeral in 1976.
"
3133,"
"
3134,"A classic never dies, dear.
"
3135,"I think it's time to revive it.
"
3136,"
"
3137,"I think we should ask the kids.
"
3138,"What do you think?
"
3139,"
"
3140,"- I'd go with the short, black one.
"
3141,"- Yeah. It's the most fun.
"
3142,"
"
3143,"There. You see? I agree.
"
3144,"
"
3145,"Fine. You ask my opinion, then don't take it.
"
3146,"
"
3147,"- I will not be held responsible for your virtue.
"
3148,"- You'll be there to protect me.
"
3149,"
"
3150,"- Stu has invited you and the kids to join us.
"
3151,"- Oh, how lovely! One big, happy family.
"
3152,"
"
3153,"I wouldn't miss that for the world!
"
3154,"Should be smashing good fun!
"
3155,"
"
3156,"- I'm so glad.
"
3157,"- When is this enchanted evening?
"
3158,"
"
3159,"Friday night, seven o'clock.
"
3160,"
"
3161,"- This Friday at seven?
"
3162,"- Yes. At my favourite restaurant. Bridges.
"
3163,"
"
3164,"- Bridges?
"
3165,"- Yes.
"
3166,"
"
3167,"- Friday at seven.
"
3168,"- Bridges.
"
3169,"
"
3170,"Sorry.
"
3171,"
"
3172,"- Bridges?
"
3173,"- Yes! Bridges.
"
3174,"
"
3175,"- The restaurant Bridges?
"
3176,"- Friday at seven.
"
3177,"
"
3178,"- I can't. Please, don't. It's bingo night, dear.
"
3179,"- Cancel it.
"
3180,"
"
3181,"I can't, dear. It's my turn
"
3182,"to pull the balls at the rectory.
"
3183,"
"
3184,"- Please join us.
"
3185,"- Don't ask me that, dear.
"
3186,"
"
3187,"I can't have my birthday without you.
"
3188,"
"
3189,"It's so important to us that you be there.
"
3190,"You're part of the family now.
"
3191,"
"
3192,"I can't have a birthday without you. It would
"
3193,"mean so much to me and the children.
"
3194,"
"
3195,"Please promise you'll come with us,
"
3196,"Mrs Doubtfire. You just have to.
"
3197,"
"
3198,"Who could resist that little face?
"
3199,"
"
3200,"- I promise.
"
3201,"- Thank you!
"
3202,"
"
3203,"- Thank you.
"
3204,"- Thank you, dear.
"
3205,"
"
3206,"- Oh! Are you all right?
"
3207,"- I'm fine.
"
3208,"
"
3209,"(woman)
"
3210,"Let's see... Nothing.
"
3211,"
"
3212,"- (Daniel) Anything in May?
"
3213,"- Not a thing.
"
3214,"
"
3215,"It doesn't look good.
"
3216,"
"
3217,"I'm sorry. Mr Lundy is completely booked
"
3218,"for the next two months.
"
3219,"
"
3220,"- I'll meet him any time, anywhere.
"
3221,"- Sorry. There's nothing I can do.
"
3222,"
"
3223,"Please. I can't cancel.
"
3224,"It's a huge opportunity.
"
3225,"
"
3226,"Take my advice: don't cancel.
"
3227,"
"
3228,"Thank you.
"
3229,"
"
3230,"- (Mrs Doubtfire) Come along, Nattie.
"
3231,"- Hello, darling!
"
3232,"
"
3233,"- Shouldn't you cover your shoulders?
"
3234,"- No! I'm fine.
"
3235,"
"
3236,"- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
"
3237,"- Good evening.
"
3238,"
"
3239,"(to himself)
"
3240,"Oh, God. Here we go.
"
3241,"
"
3242,"- Mrs Doubtfire, you look wonderful.
"
3243,"- Thank you.
"
3244,"
"
3245,"Come on. I hope you're all hungry.
"
3246,"
"
3247,"- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
"
3248,"- I'm meeting someone. Is he here?
"
3249,"
"
3250,"No, I'm sorry. He hasn't arrived yet.
"
3251,"
"
3252,"But we can seat you.
"
3253,"Smoking or nonsmoking?
"
3254,"
"
3255,"- Nonsmoking, please.
"
3256,"- Nonsmoking...
"
3257,"
"
3258,"- Tanya will seat you. Table 15.
"
3259,"- This way, please.
"
3260,"
"
3261,"- Reservation. Dunmeyer.
"
3262,"- Yes, sir.
"
3263,"
"
3264,"- Smoking or nonsmoking?
"
3265,"- Nonsmoking.
"
3266,"
"
3267,"- Smoking!
"
3268,"- Mrs Doubtfire, you don't smoke.
"
3269,"
"
3270,"No, I don't. But I did.
"
3271,"
"
3272,"I found the best way to keep from smoking
"
3273,"again is to be around those who do smoke.
"
3274,"
"
3275,"I have to randomly ingest just a little bit
"
3276,"of nicotine and it steels my wool.
"
3277,"
"
3278,"And I know you're Mr Health. Bless you
"
3279,"for putting yourself in harm's way.
"
3280,"
"
3281,"- Smoking.
"
3282,"- All right. Table 39.
"
3283,"
"
3284,"- Follow me, please.
"
3285,"- 39! My age! You're a saint.
"
3286,"
"
3287,"Thank you very much
"
3288,"for humouring an old lady.
"
3289,"
"
3290,"- (Daniel to himself) He's pissed already.
"
3291,"- Mrs Doubtfire?
"
3292,"
"
3293,"- Would you... like to join us?
"
3294,"- Ooh. I thought I saw Clint Eastwood.
"
3295,"
"
3296,"That would make my day!
"
3297,"He is such a stud-muffin.
"
3298,"
"
3299,"Will you excuse me, dear?
"
3300,"I have to check my wrap.
"
3301,"
"
3302,"- Oh, I can do it for you.
"
3303,"- Oh, no, please. I'm quite capable of...
"
3304,"
"
3305,"All right, dear. There you go.
"
3306,"
"
3307,"- Oh, and your bag too, ma'am.
"
3308,"- Drop it!
"
3309,"
"
3310,"Oh, I'm very sorry, dear. It's my medicine.
"
3311,"
"
3312,"- I have to go take my medicine now.
"
3313,"- We have water at the table.
"
3314,"
"
3315,"I can't take it orally, dear. I'll be right back.
"
3316,"
"
3317,"- (Stu) Would you like something to drink?
"
3318,"- Oh, yes. A good stiff Chardonnay.
"
3319,"
"
3320,"I like 'em light and woody.
"
3321,"
"
3322,"(phone rings)
"
3323,"
"
3324,"- Hello. Bridges Restaurant. May I help you?
"
3325,"- Yes. My name is Daniel Hillard.
"
3326,"
"
3327,"Mr Lundy is expecting me for dinner. Will you
"
3328,"tell him I'm running late, but I'm on my way?
"
3329,"
"
3330,"- I'll deliver the message personally, sir.
"
3331,"- Thank you.
"
3332,"
"
3333,"(Miranda gasps)
"
3334,"Oh!
"
3335,"
"
3336,"Oh, Stu!
"
3337,"
"
3338,"- Wow!
"
3339,"- It's beautiful.
"
3340,"
"
3341,"It's gorgeous! Thank you!
"
3342,"
"
3343,"Oooh! Did I miss anything?
"
3344,"
"
3345,"Well, yes. Look. This is the gift
"
3346,"that Stu gave me for my birthday.
"
3347,"
"
3348,"Ohhhh!
"
3349,"
"
3350,"- Isn't it gorgeous!
"
3351,"- Is it real?
"
3352,"
"
3353,"It is very real, Mrs Doubtfire.
"
3354,"
"
3355,"You can either wear that or feed a small
"
3356,"country. That's so nice. So decadent.
"
3357,"
"
3358,"Mommy, I need to go.
"
3359,"
"
3360,"- Mrs Doubtfire, would you take her?
"
3361,"- No. You.
"
3362,"
"
3363,"- She wants you, dear.
"
3364,"- Well... I'll be right back.
"
3365,"
"
3366,"OK.
"
3367,"
"
3368,"Yes, well...
"
3369,"
"
3370,"Children, look at that lovely
"
3371,"dessert tray over there.
"
3372,"
"
3373,"Why don't you go over and pick
"
3374,"what you'd like now so they could reserve it?
"
3375,"
"
3376,"- We'll be back.
"
3377,"- All right.
"
3378,"
"
3379,"That's a pretty impressive bauble you got her.
"
3380,"
"
3381,"Oh, thank you. Thank you.
"
3382,"
"
3383,"A fella gives a gift like that,
"
3384,"he wants more than a piece of her heart, eh?
"
3385,"
"
3386,"Bit of a going-down payment, huh?
"
3387,"
"
3388,"- Excuse me?
"
3389,"- You know, dear. Sink the sub.
"
3390,"
"
3391,"Hide the weasel? Park the porpoise?
"
3392,"
"
3393,"Bit of the old humpty dumpty?
"
3394,"
"
3395,"Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
"
3396,"Am I being a little graphic? Sorry.
"
3397,"
"
3398,"- I hope you're up for a little competition.
"
3399,"- I beg your pardon?
"
3400,"
"
3401,"She's got a power tool in the bedroom, dear.
"
3402,"It's her personal jackhammer.
"
3403,"
"
3404,"She uses it and the lights dim.
"
3405,"It's like a prison movie.
"
3406,"
"
3407,"Amazed she hasn't chipped her teeth. Ooh!
"
3408,"
"
3409,"I hope you bring cocktail sauce.
"
3410,"
"
3411,"She's got crabs.
"
3412,"And I don't mean Dungeness.
"
3413,"
"
3414,"I'm being blunt as a spoon, aren't I?
"
3415,"
"
3416,"Forgive me. Oh...!
"
3417,"
"
3418,"It's the wine. Oh, gosh!
"
3419,"
"
3420,"Be back in a flash. All right? My tiny bladder.
"
3421,"
"
3422,"- Mrs Doubtfire!
"
3423,"- What?
"
3424,"
"
3425,"- You're going into the men's room.
"
3426,"- No! Oh, so it is!
"
3427,"
"
3428,"I do need new glasses, dear. Sorry!
"
3429,"
"
3430,"Hello!
"
3431,"
"
3432,"Aagh!
"
3433,"
"
3434,"Jesus! God!
"
3435,"
"
3436,"- Excuse me. May I have a menu?
"
3437,"- Of course.
"
3438,"
"
3439,"- What's France like?
"
3440,"- (Stu) Very beautiful.
"
3441,"
"
3442,"Thank you very much.
"
3443,"
"
3444,"- Mr Lundy.
"
3445,"- Oh, hi.
"
3446,"
"
3447,"- Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message?
"
3448,"- Yes. Sit down.
"
3449,"
"
3450,"- How about a drink?
"
3451,"- Sure. I'll have what he's having.
"
3452,"
"
3453,"Double Chivas on the rocks.
"
3454,"
"
3455,"Bring him two doubles so he can catch up.
"
3456,"
"
3457,"- A Scotch drinker, huh? That's my kinda guy!
"
3458,"- Gentlemen, start your engines.
"
3459,"
"
3460,"- OK, everybody. Are we ready to order?
"
3461,"- Yes, I believe we are. Children, fire away.
"
3462,"
"
3463,"Shouldn't we wait for Mrs Doubtfire?
"
3464,"
"
3465,"Yes.
"
3466,"
"
3467,"OK.
"
3468,"
"
3469,"- Ah!
"
3470,"- Ah!
"
3471,"
"
3472,"- Ahaha!
"
3473,"- Ahaha!
"
3474,"
"
3475,"- (waiter) How are we doin'?
"
3476,"- No, no.
"
3477,"
"
3478,"Oh, yes. Come on.
"
3479,"
"
3480,"All right.
"
3481,"
"
3482,"Now...
"
3483,"
"
3484,"What can you do
"
3485,"to help the ratings on the kid show?
"
3486,"
"
3487,"Bottom line: don't patronise kids.
"
3488,"They're little people.
"
3489,"
"
3490,"You gotta personalise it. Make it fun.
"
3491,"If it's something you'd enjoy, they'd enjoy it.
"
3492,"
"
3493,"- That's what I'm interested in.
"
3494,"- Bingo!
"
3495,"
"
3496,"Well, I wonder what's happened
"
3497,"to Mrs Doubtfire.
"
3498,"
"
3499,"- We could cross over to the news.
"
3500,"- Would you excuse me for a moment?
"
3501,"
"
3502,"But...
"
3503,"
"
3504,"- May I help you, ma'am?
"
3505,"- Yes, dear. Thank you very much.
"
3506,"
"
3507,"Oh! Oh, my goodness!
"
3508,"
"
3509,"I'm so sorry! It's my fault.
"
3510,"
"
3511,"- Forgive me. Excuse me.
"
3512,"- I'm all right. There we go.
"
3513,"
"
3514,"Thank you. Oh, let's see here!
"
3515,"
"
3516,"- May I take your order, ma'am?
"
3517,"- Oh, yes.
"
3518,"
"
3519,"Wooh!
"
3520,"(giggles drunkenly)
"
3521,"
"
3522,"Let's see. I'll have the...
"
3523,"
"
3524,"..poached salmon.
"
3525,"
"
3526,"- And you, sir?
"
3527,"- I'll have the jambalaya.
"
3528,"
"
3529,"- Make mine not spicy. I'm allergic to pepper.
"
3530,"- Certainly, sir.
"
3531,"
"
3532,"Thank you. Cheers. Your health.
"
3533,"
"
3534,"Oop.
"
3535,"
"
3536,"Oh, my God.
"
3537,"
"
3538,"(lisps) So sorry about that.
"
3539,"Just one moment.
"
3540,"
"
3541,"Carpe dentum
"
3542,"- seize the teeth.
"
3543,"
"
3544,"Let me assist you.
"
3545,"
"
3546,"A spoon. Oh, how clever. Wait. I've got it.
"
3547,"
"
3548,"Wait. There, there. Make a pincer.
"
3549,"
"
3550,"Come at it from both sides.
"
3551,"Together - up, up, up.
"
3552,"
"
3553,"Oh... Oh! Thank you. There it is.
"
3554,"
"
3555,"Just shake them off, like a dog.
"
3556,"
"
3557,"Sorry. Oh, forgive me.
"
3558,"
"
3559,"- That's all right.
"
3560,"- Sorry about my spray.
"
3561,"
"
3562,"I'll be right back. I just have to
"
3563,"re-attach them with a little adhesive.
"
3564,"
"
3565,"- Tell him to puré'e the salmon, if you will.
"
3566,"- Puré'e the salmon.
"
3567,"
"
3568,"Thank you. Sorry about that.
"
3569,"
"
3570,"Oh, that one.
"
3571,"
"
3572,"Oh. I didn't know there was
"
3573,"someone else in here. Sorry.
"
3574,"
"
3575,"(ripping)
"
3576,"
"
3577,"Damn it! Oh, there it is. Urgh!
"
3578,"
"
3579,"Excuse me.
"
3580,"
"
3581,"(drunkenly) Where the hell have you been?
"
3582,"I ordered you another Scotch.
"
3583,"
"
3584,"- Bully!
"
3585,"- (laughs)
"
3586,"
"
3587,"- Daniel?
"
3588,"- Hm?
"
3589,"
"
3590,"Are you wearing ladies' perfume?
"
3591,"
"
3592,"Yes, I am.
"
3593,"
"
3594,"Are you wearing lipstick?
"
3595,"
"
3596,"Yeah.
"
3597,"
"
3598,"Why?
"
3599,"
"
3600,"- It rubbed off.
"
3601,"- From whom?
"
3602,"
"
3603,"A girl I used to date. She's a waitress.
"
3604,"
"
3605,"- A waitress? Here?
"
3606,"- Oh, yeah.
"
3607,"
"
3608,"On the way to the bathroom...
"
3609,"Couldn't keep her hands off me.
"
3610,"
"
3611,"(both snigger)
"
3612,"
"
3613,"- You dog!
"
3614,"- You scallywag!
"
3615,"
"
3616,"Hey, hey.
"
3617,"
"
3618,"I got the stretch outside.
"
3619,"Does your girlfriend have a girlfriend?
"
3620,"
"
3621,"- Hey, it's the '90s.
"
3622,"- No, no! I mean...
"
3623,"
"
3624,"Does she have a lady friend for me?
"
3625,"
"
3626,"- Go ahead. Ask her.
"
3627,"- I'll go ask her.
"
3628,"
"
3629,"Go on. Come on, go get 'em!
"
3630,"
"
3631,"Hey, Dan! Dan!
"
3632,"
"
3633,"I need my order for table 39!
"
3634,"
"
3635,"- Relax. I'll be out in a minute.
"
3636,"- Thank you! Great.
"
3637,"
"
3638,"(chuckles)
"
3639,"
"
3640,"39.
"
3641,"(chuckles)
"
3642,"
"
3643,"Table 39!
"
3644,"
"
3645,"Hot jambalaya!
"
3646,"
"
3647,"- Can I help you, ma'am?
"
3648,"- Sorry I'm late.
"
3649,"
"
3650,"But after all those Scotches
"
3651,"I had to piss like a racehorse.
"
3652,"
"
3653,"- Daniel?
"
3654,"- Yeah.
"
3655,"
"
3656,"Why in God's name
"
3657,"are you dressed like a woman?
"
3658,"
"
3659,"Oh, damn.
"
3660,"
"
3661,"Well...
"
3662,"
"
3663,"I'd like you to meet
"
3664,"the host of your new show.
"
3665,"
"
3666,"Host?
"
3667,"
"
3668,"Euphegenia Doubtfire, dear. I specialise in
"
3669,"the education and entertainment of children.
"
3670,"
"
3671,"(as Daniel)
"
3672,"Surprise!
"
3673,"
"
3674,"(Stu)
"
3675,"Oh, thank you very much.
"
3676,"
"
3677,"- This looks terrific.
"
3678,"- Where's Mrs Doubtfire?
"
3679,"
"
3680,"Well, I hope the dear lady's all right.
"
3681,"
"
3682,"- Shall we start?
"
3683,"- Yes. Let's start. I don't want it to get cold.
"
3684,"
"
3685,"Bon appétit.
"
3686,"
"
3687,"Tell me. Why would Mrs Doubtfire
"
3688,"be a good host?
"
3689,"
"
3690,"(rapping) I'm a hip old granny who could
"
3691,"hip-hop, bebop, dance till ya drop,...
"
3692,"
"
3693,"..and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.
"
3694,"
"
3695,"(gags and coughs)
"
3696,"
"
3697,"Stu? Stu...
"
3698,"
"
3699,"Oh, he's choking. He's choking!
"
3700,"
"
3701,"Help us! Somebody help!
"
3702,"He's choking! Help us!
"
3703,"
"
3704,"(Miranda)
"
3705,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
3706,"
"
3707,"- He's choking here! Call 911!
"
3708,"- Oh, no. I killed the bastard.
"
3709,"
"
3710,"- Mrs Doubtfire! Help us! He's choking!
"
3711,"- Help is on the way, dear!
"
3712,"
"
3713,"- Mrs Doubtfire!
"
3714,"- Help is on the way!
"
3715,"
"
3716,"- Mrs Doubtfire, he's choking!
"
3717,"- Hold on, dear.
"
3718,"
"
3719,"One more time, dear. Work with me!
"
3720,"
"
3721,"(as Daniel)
"
3722,"Come on! Come on!
"
3723,"
"
3724,"(Daniel grunts)
"
3725,"
"
3726,"Come on!
"
3727,"(grunts)
"
3728,"
"
3729,"Aaarghhh!
"
3730,"
"
3731,"(coughs)
"
3732,"
"
3733,"(gasps)
"
3734,"I'm all right.
"
3735,"
"
3736,"- (as Daniel) Are you all right?
"
3737,"- Yes.
"
3738,"
"
3739,"Almost lost ya.
"
3740,"
"
3741,"Oh, Dad.
"
3742,"
"
3743,"Oh, my...
"
3744,"
"
3745,"Daddy?
"
3746,"
"
3747,"Yeah, honey. It's me.
"
3748,"
"
3749,"(gasps)
"
3750,"
"
3751,"- Happy birthday.
"
3752,"- (yelps)
"
3753,"
"
3754,"Daniel...
"
3755,"
"
3756,"Daniel! Oh, my God!
"
3757,"
"
3758,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
"
3759,"
"
3760,"The whole time... The whole time...
"
3761,"
"
3762,"- The whole time?
"
3763,"- I'm sorry, Miranda. Please?
"
3764,"
"
3765,"Don't talk to me! Don't touch me!
"
3766,"Don't touch me!
"
3767,"
"
3768,"I have to go. We have to leave now.
"
3769,"I have to leave!
"
3770,"
"
3771,"We have to leave now!
"
3772,"I have to go! We're going.
"
3773,"
"
3774,"- You guys go.
"
3775,"- I'm sorry, Dad.
"
3776,"
"
3777,"(sighs)
"
3778,"Bye.
"
3779,"
"
3780,"Sorry about the pepper. I was...
"
3781,"
"
3782,"(Stu clears his throat)
"
3783,"
"
3784,"What are you lookin' at? Show's over.
"
3785,"
"
3786,"(judge) Miss Robeson,
"
3787,"do you have any closing remarks?
"
3788,"
"
3789,"Nothing further, Your Honour.
"
3790,"
"
3791,"Mr Hillard, since you've determined
"
3792,"to act as your own attorney,...
"
3793,"
"
3794,"..you are entitled to make
"
3795,"a closing statement at this time.
"
3796,"
"
3797,"Your Honour, in the past two months,
"
3798,"I've secured a residence, refurbished it...
"
3799,"
"
3800,"..and made it ""an environment
"
3801,"fit for children"". Those are your words.
"
3802,"
"
3803,"I'm also holding down ajob as a shipping
"
3804,"clerk. So I believe I met your requirements.
"
3805,"
"
3806,"Ahead of schedule.
"
3807,"
"
3808,"In regards to my behaviour...
"
3809,"
"
3810,"..I can only plead insanity.
"
3811,"
"
3812,"Because, ever since my children were born,...
"
3813,"
"
3814,"..the moment I looked at them,
"
3815,"I was crazy about them.
"
3816,"
"
3817,"Once I held them, I was hooked.
"
3818,"
"
3819,"I'm addicted to my children, sir.
"
3820,"
"
3821,"I love them with all my heart.
"
3822,"
"
3823,"And the idea of someone telling me I can't
"
3824,"be with them, I can't see them every day...
"
3825,"
"
3826,"It's like someone saying I can't have air.
"
3827,"
"
3828,"I can't live without air,
"
3829,"and I can't live without them.
"
3830,"
"
3831,"Listen, I would do anything. I just want
"
3832,"to be with them. I know I need that, sir.
"
3833,"
"
3834,"We have a history.
"
3835,"
"
3836,"And I just... They mean everything to me.
"
3837,"And they need me as much as I need them.
"
3838,"
"
3839,"So, please,...
"
3840,"
"
3841,"..don't take my kids away from me.
"
3842,"
"
3843,"(sighs)
"
3844,"
"
3845,"Thank you.
"
3846,"
"
3847,"Mr Hillard...
"
3848,"
"
3849,"You've been able to fool a lot of people into
"
3850,"believing that you're a 60-year-old woman.
"
3851,"
"
3852,"No easy task.
"
3853,"
"
3854,"And your little speech seemed to be...
"
3855,"very heartfelt and genuine.
"
3856,"
"
3857,"But I believe it to be a terrific performance
"
3858,"by a very gifted actor. Nothing more.
"
3859,"
"
3860,"- No. It's not that.
"
3861,"- The reality, Mr Hillard,...
"
3862,"
"
3863,"..is that your lifestyle over the past month
"
3864,"has been very unorthodox.
"
3865,"
"
3866,"And I refuse to further subject
"
3867,"three innocent children...
"
3868,"
"
3869,"..to your peculiar
"
3870,"and potentially harmful behaviour.
"
3871,"
"
3872,"It is this court's decision
"
3873,"to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.
"
3874,"
"
3875,"Oh, God, no.
"
3876,"
"
3877,"You will have supervised
"
3878,"visitation rights every Saturday.
"
3879,"
"
3880,"Supervised, sir?
"
3881,"
"
3882,"A court liaison will accompany you
"
3883,"when you spend time with the children.
"
3884,"
"
3885,"I am suggesting a period of psychological
"
3886,"testing and perhaps treatment for you.
"
3887,"
"
3888,"We will re-examine this case
"
3889,"one year from now.
"
3890,"
"
3891,"Thank you. Court is adjourned.
"
3892,"(bangs gavel)
"
3893,"
"
3894,"I don't do laundry.
"
3895,"I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.
"
3896,"
"
3897,"I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.
"
3898,"And I don't do diapers.
"
3899,"
"
3900,"My children have been potty-trained
"
3901,"for some time.
"
3902,"
"
3903,"Well, I don't do washing.
"
3904,"I don't do basements.
"
3905,"
"
3906,"I don't do dinners. I don't do reading.
"
3907,"
"
3908,"Ah.
"
3909,"
"
3910,"Yes. Well, we have your number.
"
3911,"Thank you so much for coming.
"
3912,"
"
3913,"- We'll be getting back to you.
"
3914,"- Thank you.
"
3915,"
"
3916,"I'll show you to the door.
"
3917,"
"
3918,"Yes, here we are. Please...
"
3919,"
"
3920,"Laura, that shipment
"
3921,"has been delayed three times.
"
3922,"
"
3923,"Yes, but...
"
3924,"
"
3925,"Laura, I'm not gonna wait
"
3926,"another six months for it.
"
3927,"
"
3928,"You do that. Call me back.
"
3929,"
"
3930,"Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.
"
3931,"
"
3932,"Everything's gonna be all right.
"
3933,"
"
3934,"- I miss her spaghetti.
"
3935,"- I miss herjokes.
"
3936,"
"
3937,"I miss her stories.
"
3938,"
"
3939,"Don't worry. We will find someone.
"
3940,"There are plenty of people out there.
"
3941,"
"
3942,"Nobody like her.
"
3943,"
"
3944,"All right. I admit things were a lot nicer
"
3945,"when she was around.
"
3946,"
"
3947,"The house was so warm and cosy, the beds
"
3948,"were always made, and the dinner was...
"
3949,"
"
3950,"She isn't real! We have to stop referring to her
"
3951,"as if she were a real person.
"
3952,"
"
3953,"(Mrs Doubtfire's voice) Hello, my dears!
"
3954,"
"
3955,"We have a wonderful show today.
"
3956,"
"
3957,"We have Mr Van Zandt from the Sierra Club,...
"
3958,"
"
3959,"..and he's going to bring some animals
"
3960,"that are endangered species.
"
3961,"
"
3962,"- Do you know what that means, poppets?
"
3963,"- Did you say ""puppet""?
"
3964,"
"
3965,"Oh, no, dear! It's Kovacs! Welcome, Kovacs!
"
3966,"
"
3967,"Hi, guys. Did you say ""extinction""?
"
3968,"Does something stink?
"
3969,"
"
3970,"It's not something smelling bad. Extinction
"
3971,"means there's no more of a particular animal.
"
3972,"
"
3973,"- Oh, my God.
"
3974,"- Doesn't that make you a little mad?
"
3975,"
"
3976,"- Very mad!
"
3977,"- Tell people about it.
"
3978,"
"
3979,"I'm mad! You know why? Because next,
"
3980,"it's the chimps! There are fewer chimps...
"
3981,"
"
3982,"Doesn't it make you mad that
"
3983,"humans play your parts in movies?
"
3984,"
"
3985,"Ooh! ""Planet of the Apes"": who gets the role?
"
3986,"Roddy McDowall! I'd be better than that!
"
3987,"
"
3988,"- I'd be better than Charlton Heston!
"
3989,"- And your rug is better, too.
"
3990,"
"
3991,"You could fly to Persia on that rug.
"
3992,"
"
3993,"- Shall we tell them where we'll be tomorrow?
"
3994,"- Yeah. They wanna know.
"
3995,"
"
3996,"Tomorrow, poppets,
"
3997,"we're taking a wonderful trip.
"
3998,"
"
3999,"But you don't have to pack
"
4000,"because we're going in our mind.
"
4001,"
"
4002,"We're going across the Atlantic Ocean...
"
4003,"
"
4004,"..to England, where I came from.
"
4005,"
"
4006,"- You came from England?
"
4007,"- It's a wonderful country.
"
4008,"
"
4009,"- Do you know about England?
"
4010,"- It's an island.
"
4011,"
"
4012,"It's an island, dear. A glorious one.
"
4013,"
"
4014,"- They have a queen and a royal family.
"
4015,"- Oh! Just like a poker game!
"
4016,"
"
4017,"- It's a full house.
"
4018,"- Some cards don't live at home any more.
"
4019,"
"
4020,"Thanks to mobile phones.
"
4021,"
"
4022,"Do you know what language
"
4023,"they speak in England?
"
4024,"
"
4025,"- Pakistani?
"
4026,"- That's right. In many stores they do.
"
4027,"
"
4028,"But we'll get into that tomorrow,
"
4029,"boys and girls.
"
4030,"
"
4031,"- You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.
"
4032,"- I'm gonna give you two.
"
4033,"
"
4034,"- All right, dear.
"
4035,"- Here's one on the cheek...
"
4036,"
"
4037,"- ..and here's a monkey bite!
"
4038,"- Aaarghhh! Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!
"
4039,"
"
4040,"Well, that's all for today. Bye-bye.
"
4041,"
"
4042,"(director)
"
4043,"Cut!
"
4044,"
"
4045,"That's a wrap, folks! Thank you very much.
"
4046,"
"
4047,"We're a smash! Number one in our time slot!
"
4048,"
"
4049,"Yes! Calls from Detroit, Cleveland,
"
4050,"Chicago, Los Angeles...
"
4051,"
"
4052,"- All with offers to syndicate.
"
4053,"- Hollywood!
"
4054,"
"
4055,"- Daniel?
"
4056,"- (whoop of joy)
"
4057,"
"
4058,"- Daniel?
"
4059,"- Yes?
"
4060,"
"
4061,"- Miranda.
"
4062,"- Could I talk to you?
"
4063,"
"
4064,"Yeah.
"
4065,"
"
4066,"I'll be right out. Just wait here.
"
4067,"
"
4068,"Welcome to Euphegenia's house.
"
4069,"
"
4070,"A little draughty but... you know. It's nice.
"
4071,"
"
4072,"What can I do for you?
"
4073,"
"
4074,"First of all, congratulations on the show.
"
4075,"
"
4076,"Thanks. You got to see the dress rehearsal.
"
4077,"
"
4078,"We've... The kids...
"
4079,"
"
4080,"We've been watching every day.
"
4081,"
"
4082,"It's nice to know they can see me every day.
"
4083,"
"
4084,"Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take
"
4085,"a long time to get over all the fights and...
"
4086,"
"
4087,"..all the horrible things we said to each other.
"
4088,"
"
4089,"It's... It's so hard.
"
4090,"
"
4091,"But I know somehow you and I will be
"
4092,"all right and we'll get through this.
"
4093,"
"
4094,"But the kids...
"
4095,"
"
4096,"I don't wanna hurt our children.
"
4097,"
"
4098,"So what do you want me to do?
"
4099,"
"
4100,"You want me to pretend everything's
"
4101,"all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?
"
4102,"
"
4103,"Jesus, Miranda.
"
4104,"You took my children away from me.
"
4105,"
"
4106,"I can only see them now with supervision.
"
4107,"
"
4108,"Some woman watches me with the kids
"
4109,"like I'm some sort of deviant.
"
4110,"
"
4111,"If I try to hug 'em, she wonders why.
"
4112,"You know what that's like?
"
4113,"
"
4114,"You just sat there in that courtroom and
"
4115,"let that judge pass that despicable sentence.
"
4116,"
"
4117,"- I was angry.
"
4118,"- Oh, God.
"
4119,"
"
4120,"- You hurt me, too!
"
4121,"- You ripped my heart out!
"
4122,"
"
4123,"You lied... Uh, you know what?
"
4124,"I don't wanna do this any more.
"
4125,"
"
4126,"I don't wanna do any more
"
4127,"""who did what to whom"".
"
4128,"
"
4129,"(Miranda sighs)
"
4130,"
"
4131,"Ever since this happened,
"
4132,"I've been trying to make sense out of it.
"
4133,"
"
4134,"And the only thing I know in my heart
"
4135,"is that the children were happier...
"
4136,"
"
4137,"..when Mrs Doubtfire was a part of their lives.
"
4138,"
"
4139,"Yeah?
"
4140,"
"
4141,"She... She brought out the best in them.
"
4142,"
"
4143,"- She brought out the best in you.
"
4144,"- And you.
"
4145,"
"
4146,"Yeah.
"
4147,"
"
4148,"They miss her terribly.
"
4149,"
"
4150,"- What are you saying?
"
4151,"- Daniel, the kids need you.
"
4152,"
"
4153,"I need them.
"
4154,"
"
4155,"Well, tomorrow we'll have Frank,
"
4156,"who is a make-up artist.
"
4157,"
"
4158,"- (knocking)
"
4159,"- Oh! A big knock at the door.
"
4160,"
"
4161,"Who could that be?
"
4162,"And do we have enough time?
"
4163,"
"
4164,"Mr Sprinkles, boys and girls!
"
4165,"
"
4166,"Hello! What do you have for me today?
"
4167,"
"
4168,"- Mrs Doubtflier, I've got a letter from Katie...
"
4169,"- (doorbell)
"
4170,"
"
4171,"It's the new baby-sitter.
"
4172,"
"
4173,"Come on, guys! Get up! Let's go!
"
4174,"
"
4175,"Come on.
"
4176,"
"
4177,"It's gonna be all right.
"
4178,"
"
4179,"Chris, wait right over there. Everybody.
"
4180,"
"
4181,"Daddy!
"
4182,"
"
4183,"Hi.
"
4184,"
"
4185,"- What's goin' on?
"
4186,"- I'm here to pick you up.
"
4187,"
"
4188,"Your dad's gonna take you
"
4189,"for a few hours every day after school.
"
4190,"
"
4191,"Really?
"
4192,"
"
4193,"What about the courts? That legal stuff.
"
4194,"
"
4195,"- Ask your mom.
"
4196,"- I took care of it.
"
4197,"
"
4198,"No more supervised visits.
"
4199,"No more court liaison.
"
4200,"
"
4201,"- Just us?
"
4202,"- Just us.
"
4203,"
"
4204,"Go get Mr Bear.
"
4205,"
"
4206,"- Go get your stuff. Hurry up.
"
4207,"- All right.
"
4208,"
"
4209,"- Would you like to come in?
"
4210,"- I'll wait outside.
"
4211,"
"
4212,"OK.
"
4213,"
"
4214,"Thank you.
"
4215,"
"
4216,"See ya.

4237,"You know, some parents get along
"
4238,"much better when they don't live together.

4239,"

4240,"They don't fight all the time
