109,You're back with the new album.
110,"What's next, is slated to be your comeback project."
111,But critics are all wondering whether or not it will live up to the success of your previous releases.
112, I mean I know it's a lot going on in the media as of this morning but I can take it.
113,"You know, when I think my fans are going to be thoroughly pleased with what we got going for them on the album."
114, You sound very confident about your new album.
115," Well I mean, my paps always told me, even if you got to smile through bad situations to smile and get through them."
116, Speaking of difficult situations.
117,"You were recently caught on tape with the pop star, Jordan Holmes."
118,How does your girlfriend Kiaira K feel about that?
119,She can't be handling that well.
120," Kamilah, we're right here, we're going there already!"
121," I can't hold back with my first, right?"
122, Listen Kamilah.
123, I love Kiaira always will.
124,And that's that?
125,"So my new single ""Ain't Just Sex""."

131, Just talking about what matters.
132," Right, what's up baby  Let's welcome Kiaira K publicist to the stars to the show."
133,So you are saying this happens.
134," No, what we're saying is we wanna focus on the album, not the negativity."
135," Okay, so when was the first time that you cheated on Kiaira?"
136,Was this recently?
137," Kamilah, can we focus on the album, please."
138, Why don't you just tell the truth.
139," Kamilah, it didn't happen."
140,Okay he did not cheat on me.
141,"I know Will, that video was old long before he and I even got together."
142," Will, why don't you just admit that you made a mistake?"
143,We all know you're not perfect.
144,Even though you pretend to be.
145, I asked you not to discuss this.
146,I have not cheated on Kiaira.
147,Now please can we keep back to the interview before I turn into a meme on this show.
148, And we'll be right back after this commercial break with the Kamilah Trill Show.
149," Kamilah, what the hell is wrong with you?"
150,You set me up.
151," Told you that nothing was off the table, stop tryna people please."
152,"And just admit not just to her and your fans, but to yourself."
153, Look Kamilah.
154,We're trying to give you an opportunity to fix this like a professional or if you'd like for me to step out of character I can drag you across a little gossip show.
155," Oh, excuse me."
156,You're threatening me for telling the truth about Will's foolery.
157,Everyone knows that Will has been cheating on you for years Kiaira The whole industry knows.
158, Come on she's lying Ki. She one of the ones  Cheating with who?
159, This is business and ratings are going to be ratings.
160,Whether or not you wanna pretend that the whole world didn't see him and Jordan on tape.
161,Or let's not R Kelly this situation.
162,Just tell the truth Will.
163," Listen Kamilah, what I do and don't do don't got shit to do with you."
164,Aight.
165,But please don't forget who I am.
166, You're delusional.
167,You're everybody's business.
168,You're a public figure.
169,And you screwed up royally.
170," We are about to come from commerical show, places everybody."
171," Either you talk or you leave either way I'm gonna be reporting your news, Mr. Perfect."
172, Okay cool.
173,"Actually, Kamilah, I got a story for you."
174,Kiss my ass.
175," Ooh, word?"
176, And we're back from our commercial break with Kiaira K.
177,Girl let's talk.
178, Let's talk.
179, Hey Dad.
180, Son how're you doing?
181, I heard about what's going on.
182,"âª Happy birthday to you âª Happy birthday to you âª Happy birthday William Clay Gregory the Third âª âª Happy birthday to you We love you, Will."
183,We saw your interview on the TV and I thought you said that Kamilah girl was your friend.
184,She seemed a little rude if you asked me.
185, Mom she was just doing he job.
186,I mean honestly.
187,Everybody wanted her to go hard and then that on me.
188,So I think I came out pretty good.
189, Anyway it's just uncomfortable for us to see you go under so much pressure on national TV.
190, Speaking of pressure Will.
191,"How's Kiaira you know, dealing with all this."
192, You knew her handled the business and cleaning up the mess.
193, Alright.
194,"Well, tell her, I asked for, I got to go check on the mac and cheese."
195," Hey Will, you still here?"
196, I'm still here Pops.
197, Look here now I know you're dealing with something that I can't even understand.
198,Fame and life in the limelight.
199,You got everyone up in your business.
200,That could be overwhelming now now just remember your foundation and put your trust in God.
201,Thank you dad.
202,I needed to hear that right about now.
203," You always got a home here, all right?"
204,If you need to come back here and you need a break and leave that popstar bunnies alone.
205, Okay dad.
206, And don't forget.
207,Think about what I said.
208, Mommy loves you Will.
209, I love y'all too.
210, I know y'all done heard what happened what happened on Kamilah Trill today?
211,"Will Clay, ya boy dropped the ball on live television and Kamila pressed him about him cheating on his fiance with Jordan Holmes."
212, Embarrassing.
213," Let tell you, we got all the tea today."
214," Totally, totally unacceptable and embarrassing."
215,But what do you expect from a guy like Will Clay?
216, You just don't like him.
217," No, it's not that I don't like him."
218,"It's just that like I said, I judge people by their actions."
219, Yes.
220," Okay, his action is showing time and time again that he's a piece of shit."
221,That's it.
222,He's a piece of shit and I'm not surprised.
223,"Okay, you're surprised?"
224, I can give him a little bit more credit than you're giving him.
225, I'm not surprised at all.
226,What I am surprised is that Kiaira is coming to his defense.
227,Like why is she coming to his defense when he cheated on her?
228,That's crazy to me.
229," So black women, we do have to stop doing this."
230,We have to stop putting ourselves as the sacrifice in front of black men.
231,She should have just let him and left his ass out there and let him do whatever he needed to do and catch that L.
232, Apparently now I'm no moral authority.
233,"Okay, but I can call out."
234,"Definitely, I can call out low character."
235,"When I see it now, Kiaira needs to leave him instead of coming to his defense."
236," Black men, don't cheat, that's what they say."
237,"Unfortunately this one did 'cause they got the footage to prove it, baby I done seen that thang."
238,And it's crazy.
239,"But to be honest, this is probably a publicity stunt."
240,That Kiaira has set up in order to help promote his new album.
241,Cause that's what we're all talking about him now.
242," No, no, no."
243,It's not a publicity stunt.
244,"Okay, alright."
245,What do you expect from Will the heartthrob  I can give him more credit than you give him.
246," No, trust me."
247,He's not gonna be faithful to anyone but himself.
248,"It's just, it is what it is."
249,See things for what they are it is what it is.
250," Look, I couldn't really tell if it was him."
251,"It was kind of like that, you know?"
252, It was him.
253," Okay, I guess look, we got the tea everyday, all day on TKA."
254,See you guys next time.
255,I'm your girl Mona.
256," I'm your boy, Justin."
257," Justin don't like Will Clay, but we out here love you guys, peace."
258, Check it out.
259, What?
260, What y'all think.
261," Think about what, why are we here?"
262,What is this?
263, This is my inspiration for my next video.
264,"For ""Ain't Just Sex"" came down here."
265,"I was looking at it and I'm like, this is the direction I'm trying to go."
266," Okay first of all, we need to be focusing on getting in front of this Kamilah Trill interview and this Jordan Holmes video."
267, This is my way of getting in front of it.
268,With the music.
269,I'm telling you It's doper than it looks.
270,"Rod, What you think?"
271,"I don't know man. I kind of like the smoke, baby oil...girls."
272, nigga nigga.
273,I just got in trouble for that.
274,"No, come on a slap in the face to the fans."
275,"If I did something like that, promoting sex."
276,"I'm thinking now, imagine it lit up electric. I'm telling you."
277,"Will Clay, ""Ain't Just Sex""."
278,vocalizing âª You say I'm too much. âª âª So I take it slowly.

282,"âª Damn âª Is better than money and drugs âª âª Is better than kisses and hugs âª âª It's better than falling in love âª  Snap out of it Okay, this is cute."
283,Glitz in your gram and your lights.
284,"We need to focus on the real Okay, you can hump all the lil groupies that you want."
285,That's our deal.
286,That's fine.
287,But now it's in the public eye and you embarrass the hell out of me on national TV.
288,"Ki, I didn't know anyone was going to record it. Come on."
289,"Oh, so now it's the person that taped its problem."

466," Shardae, please do me a favor and snatch this jawn weave out."
467, I'm going to let her live off Will's hard work and success another year.

540," Yeah, you love to lie."
541, No I don't.
542,"But you don't mind if I lie and it benefits you, come here."
543," Stop it, just saying I'm not in the mood."
544, I didn't ask if you were in the mood.
545,"(Staci G) âª so early in the morning, or the evening, âª Or late afternoon  That's your fire, right?"
546, Hell yeah.
547,But who laid down in reference?
548,That is Staci G.
549,We were working on it for a while now.
550,You want me to go get her out of studio B?
551," Yo is she signed, 'cause if she ain't signed I think I'm gonna need to get her for my new label."
552," Yo, I've been telling her that you would love her style."
553,She reminds me of you. I'ma go get her.
554, Alright.
555," Will baby girl, Staci G."
556,Staci it's the homie Will Clay.
557,Staci I just played him the track that you referenced for him.
558,Yo I'm telling you she's the next Lauryn Hill.
559," Yo, this is crazy."
560,It is so amazing to meet you.
561,Like I grew up listening to you.
562,So for you to be standing here is insane.
563,"You're like one of my greatest inspiration  But first of all, grew up come on."
564,Don't make me feel so old.
565,How old are you anyway?
566, 18.
567, Okay maybe I am old.
568,"Oh, what was I doing when I was I think I was just signing my first deal."
569," Yo, Stacy plays the hell out of the guitar too."
570,And that's all I got plugged to her.
571,I wanted a guitarist and I was looking for a lady so everybody recommended Staci.
572, Okay so you play the guitar and you sing.
573,Question?
574,You're trying to be a musician or you're trying to be an artist?
575, An artist for sure.
576," Okay, okay."
577,You got any more original music I can hear.
578, Well I've been producing with my iPad since I was like 15 and Mell has been working me for months now.
579," Staci, I know you just didn't tell me you've been producing on the iPad."
580,Bro man times have truly changed.
581,For real.
582,I got an idea though.
583,Staci G how would you feel about opening up for Will Clay?
584,"On my new world tour, and possibly sign into my new label?"
585," What, hell yeah I'm with all of that."
586," Okay, that's what I like to hear but I'm gonna tell you this though."
587,I ain't going to go easy on you.
588,Cause that just ain't the Will Clay way.
589, You better not go easy.
590,Cause it wasn't nobody easy on you.
591,You already know.
592," Oh, look, I'm here for all of it."
593,But I was wondering would you be willing to sing the song that I referenced for Rell as a duet instead of by yourself?
594, Staci G and Will Clay.
595,"Yo, I think I'm here for that."
596,Let's go cut it now.
597,You got to show me all those riffs and runs you was doing.
598,"âª Ooouuu, ooouuu, yeah All Over Me âª I don't need steak and eggs or breakfast in bed, âª âª Cuz you always keep me satisfied, âª âª Keep my appetite fed, âª So early in the morning, âª or evening, âª or late afternoon, âª All my body needs is you âª So baby put your hands, âª All over me, âª And baby put your lips, âª All over me, me, me, âª All over me, âª And I don't need a million girls, âª âª I just need you, âª Oh, see you're the first thing on my mind, âª âª The last thing that I wanna do, âª âª Ooh, ooh, yeah, âª So when I'm lonely and I need your touch, âª âª You're the only feeling I want. âª âª So baby put your hands, âª Yeah âª All over me, âª Over me, baby âª And baby put your lips, âª Just put your lips, âª All over me, me, me, âª All over me, âª I said all over me, âª I said all over me, âª I said all over me, âª I said all over me, âª I said all over me, âª All over me, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Just put your hands, âª Just put your hands, âª All over me, âª Over me âª Ooooo âª Baby, put your lips âª Put 'em on me, âª All over me, âª All over, all over, all over me baby, âª âª All over me, âª All over me, âª All over me, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Ooouuuooo, âª Yeah, âª Just put your hands, âª All over me baby, âª Just put your hands, âª Just put your hands, âª All over me, âª Ooouuu, âª Ooouuu  Okay."

615,"I mean, come on."
616,She's exactly what we looking for.
617," Hi, I can't believe I'm in the same room with Will Clay and Kiaira K."
618," And we can't believe we're in the same room as Staci G G, G."
619, Stop stop don't embarrass me.
620," Ki I told you, look, we got to sign her."
621," I mean, that wasn't bad."

632, Hey guys.
633,What's up?
634,To all my home bodies out there.
635,Thank you for holding me down and having my back.
636,Cause these last couple of weeks have been crazy.
637,People have been calling out my name.
638,Paparazzi is harassing me and my family everywhere I go about (Jordan Holmes) rumors and lies.
639,Look I just want to set the record straight.
640,Okay Will and I are just friends.
641,"The footage isn't recent, and he's actually like..."
642,He's like a mentor and there hasn't been anything between us I respect him and Kiaira's relationship and I expect y'all to do the same.
643,"Okay on another note, my single's coming out."
644, What?
645,Babe.
646, You're welcome.
647," Oh, how'd you do that?"
648, I got my sources.
649," That's talking about my baby Kiaira K Ooh, ooh ooh come here Kiaira K Ooh, Ooh!"
650,"Hey come on, let's go."
651,K.
652,You're a fool (jazz music playing in background)  Goodnight.
653,Sorry we're closed.
654, Perfect timing.
655, What you're doing here?
656,"I'm vindicated, baby."
657, I see things must be going good if you're doing a surprise pop ups on your friends.
658," Come on, Shardae I said I'm sorry."
659, So you just came to kick it or apologize for the other day.
660, I actually came to talk to you.
661,I need a little bit of advice or something.
662,And I know he wanted a few people in my life.
663,We're actually gonna keep it one hundred with me.
664,"All right, wassup?"
665,You know how rough stuff been going lately.
666,And I just been thinking about getting older as an artist and what I'm going to do after this.
667,And I know I'm not too old yet but I've been doing this for a long time and it's really starting to take a toll on me.
668," You in your feelings again, talking about taking a break from your music."
669,Is that what you really want to do?
670," Not all the way, look check it out."
671,"So I met this artist's name, Staci G, And she is cold, she's lit When I tell you she just got the IT factor and it dawned on me."
672,Maybe I could develop an artist.
673,I'm more than just my voice.
674, So what y'all going to be like a Rick James and Teena Marie.
675,You got jokes. See girl you always playing too much.
676, No I'm going sign her.
677,"I'm a develop her, write with her, create a classic album and bow out as Will artist and welcome as Will the executive."
678, It's ambitious I like it.
679,You know I'll support your stuff.
680,"(Will) Oh, thank you!"
681, So is Kiaira cool with this?
682, What'd you think about last night?
683, What sex?
684, No Stacey G at the studio.
685, Why are we talking about this now?
686,I'm ready to go upstairs for round two.
687, Because it's just been on my mind heavy and I'm want to make sure we lock her down before we lose her.
688," Look, she was good and all well, but we need to focus on you and getting you locked into this longterm deal."
689,That's money on the table now.
690, I just think about it.
691,Staci could be the key to getting our record label off the ground and I could retire and maybe just transition into working on her and me and you guess what we can do?
692,You can start a family.
693,You talking about retiring and becoming a produ... Chile! Please.
694,you need to worry about singing.
695,And let me and Rodney worry about your career.
696,All right.
697,Wow!
698,"I will see you later, family, man."
699, Wow goodnight to you too.
700," So Kiaira, isn't cool with it."
701, Not the way she was talking.
702, But would you do it without her?
703," I don't know, I've been with Kiaira and Rod for so long."
704,"It's like, I couldn't even imagine my life, or my career without them."
705, Well you need to do what's best for you.
706,And sometimes Rodney and Kiaira don't have your best interests in mind.
707, Why are you so dope Shardae?
708,You've been literally one of the most consistent people in my life.
709," All your life, and best friends tell each other the truth."
710,And I don't want you to waking up one day and just realizing that your purpose was right in front of you.
711,You are more than a beautiful man that can sing.
712, So you think I'm beautiful.
713, Always ruining a tender moment with ya pretty ass.
714,(jazz music playing in the background)  Hey baby.
715," Rodney, how you doing man?"
716,Thank you so much.
717,Thank you man.
718,I appreciate it.
719,"Oh the good stuff, huh?"
720, Hey Steve.
721,You mind if I get another round of that?
722,Oh yeah.
723,Feel free to indulge.
724, Yeah damn right.
725, Especially you Will.
726,I'm gonna take this whole bottle home.
727, So we want to commend you all.
728,"Will, Rodney, and Kiaira for all of your hard work and achievements and your new world tour that we believe will be your best yet."
729, Thank you so much.
730,It's shaping up to be pretty lit.
731,We all know by now that initially we had some doubts onto whether or not we could get a good return from an RnB album that seemed to speak to only a certain demographic.
732,"But ultimately, ultimately, you surpassed those expectations with the creation of this new album."
733," Your support means everything to us Steve, thank you so much."
734, So how about these contracts cause that's why we're here tonight right?
735,"That is why we're here, right?"
736," See, that's what I like about you."
737,You put your business first  You know.
738, So let me introduce you to Braxton McCall.
739,He is our bright new executive that was brought over from the merger with BCMA.
740, Think he was at the birthday party right?
741," Yeah, he was."
742,So this is more like your second introduction.
743, I recognize you man.
744,Good to see you.
745, Good to see you.
746,"Thank you, Steve."
747,"Will, my sole purpose is to strengthen our partnership with the deal that benefits us all and takes your career to the next level."
748,So I'll be teaming up with Kiaira and Rodney behind the scenes to ensure that dream.
749,I think you'll be happy with our very lucrative offer that far exceeds any offer that any R&B artists would receive in today's climate.
750,"This agreement would take effect, once you first step on stage for your new world tour this summer."
751, We want you to know how much you're valued Will.
752," Damn, I mean, well, yes, this is good stuff."
753, Will.
754," I mean, it's a nice number, but it's a 360."
755,I don't do those.
756," Look, I totally understand."
757,"Look, 360's get a bad rep but I still think you can see the benefits of this."
758, Will everyone in this room knows how amazing you are and all of the great talents that you possess.
759,"Braxton and Steve, wanna make you the face of their new merger and a major brand worldwide."
760,"Our first priority is going to be getting you moved from the East coast to LA, where BMCA is finest agents are located and getting you into the new artist development program."
761, Wait what?
762,I just moved back.
763,Y'all want me to go back and do what? I know y'all don't think Will Clay going through anybody's artist development program and actually did Kiaira tell y'all that I'm actually not even sure that I want to be an artist anymore.
764,I kind of want to get on a backend and do some producing.
765," Will, I'm confused I just..."
766, Do you mind if we just had a moment with Will outside?
767, Kiki look I know what I want.
768,I know what I want.
769,"Okay, we'll be back."
770, I don't know why y'all had to pull me out to meeting.
771,Being all dramatic.
772, Somebody want to tell me what the hell was that in there?
773, That was Mr. Gregory over here wants to leave all this money on the table.
774,"So you can start his new record label with his muse for the day, Staci G."
775, Hold on.
776,"Wait, Nobody thought it was important to tell me that before we walked in there?"
777, Think about it y'all we don't need them.
778,"The three of us, we know the game but we also know music."
779,Add that with Staci well we got magic.
780," Will, I get it, but it's a lot of commas in there, man."
781, A lot of commas.
782, Can we do both?
783, Bro that's chump change compared to our work Think about it.
784,If we get ownership we're not living off the advances that the label given us.
785,"It's a big picture move here, bro."
786,Come on.
787,You know what?
788,It's my career.
789,Y'all gotta do what I tell y'all to do because I pay y'all.
790,I write the checks.
791,So this is what I want.
792,This is what I'm going to go in there and make it happen.
793,That's all I'm saying.
794," Relax, you're getting a little, worked up, calm down."
795,Let's talk about that.
796," All right, listen Ki you go in there, make something up."
797, Make something up?
798,You guys?
799,Oh my God.
800," You you go home, and go get some rest."
801,And we'll reconvene tomorrow.
802,"We'll figure this out, okay?"
803," Rodney, Kiaira, this is deeper than what know."
804,I made a promise to my grandfather many years ago at his grave that I would never settle.
805,And then I would always remember that all things are possible through Christ and y'all gotta make it happen.
806," Okay, okay, I'll handle it and I'll make sure we take care of what you need first and foremost, okay?"
807, Fix this.
808," But listen, this is what I find interesting."
809,I always took Will Clay to be selfish.
810,Like he's like a pretty boy.
811, Cause he is.
812,He definitely is.
813,"But, it looked like he wanted to do something a little bit more than sing apparently."
814,Ya know my sources tells me that he done turn down the multimillion dollar deal in pursuit of doing his own thing independently.
815," Okay, I see you, Will Clay."
816,"I'm not gonna turn down a big deal like that, but it's okay to each's own."

961,"There's gotta be another option other than this because sparkles that ain't the aesthetic I'm going for  No shut up Will, you look fine."
962,"Stop being overly dramatic, okay?"
963,I know you want to be your own man and dress yourself but less thinking more singing.
964,Okay leave the decision making to me.
965, What you tryna say.
966,I can't make my own decisions?
967, What?
968,"I am not having this conversation right now, okay?"

1002,Can you add some more reverb when we get over in the room?
1003, Yeah first off you sounded great.
1004,Kiaira told me not to add any more reverb.
1005," No, no Kiara got nothing to do with the way I sound, I do."
1006,So go over there and add some more reverb like I asked got it?
1007," Yes, sir."
1008," Cool also while you're at it, can you talk to the lighting designer?"
1009,The lights ain't doing nothing for me.
1010,They gotta dance we need like some gobos or some movers or something.
1011,Can y'all do something about that.
1012, I don't want to be combative.
1013, Kiaira told me I can't make any set design changes without her prior approval.
1014,She said she has to approve everything.
1015," No, no excuse me."
1016,Kiaira said what?
1017," Will, baby, listen."
1018, I'll get right on that for you.
1019," So yeah, about that Kiaira thought we should change that too."
1020, Yo Rodney you're my homie.
1021,But you got to start realizing who pays who here.
1022,"Alright when I ask somebody to do something in my rehearsal, I want to hear yes sir."

1026," My pleasure, sir."
1027, My pleasure sir.
1028," I'm sick of hearing all this goddamn Kiaira said, Kiaira said this my show."
1029,"And if y'all could implement that, that y'all could both hit the door."
1030,"And I mean that, bro."
1031,I don't wanna hit any doors.
1032,I don't ain't deal with this shit no more.
1033," Okay I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
1034," What? Will, no, one's begging you to be here."
1035,Okay Staci G is ready.
1036, You two are hilarious.
1037," No, no, no chill Rod."
1038, What you mean Staci G's ready?
1039,This is my show.
1040, I mean that this show is gonna go on with or without you.
1041,I just wonder what your fans are gonna think when they find out that their little favorite artists backed out because he didn't get his way.
1042," Man, fuck them fans."
1043,And this dumb ass show is deeper than that.
1044,"And you know what Kiaira, you've been trying to control and manipulate my career with your analytics and all your formula since day one."
1045,But guess what?
1046,You can't recreate God given talent.
1047, Will please.
1048, And it's right here.
1049,Something your ass won't never know nothing about.
1050,Kiaira what you got to realize?
1051,This is a thousand of you but it's only one of me.
1052,And I mean that.
1053, He didn't mean that.
1054, Yes he did.
1055, If you think that you can make it without me go right ahead.
1056,But don't you dare come running back when everything falls apart.
1057, Will she didn't mean it bro.
1058, What're doing?
1059, Hey Ki fuck you.
1060," Will, Will we can fix this."
1061,"Will, Will."
1062, Rodney he's washed we got Staci and she is the future.
1063, Let's go.
1064," Like, I really hope he takes his pompous ass and stops alienating folks and talking about his fans like give the younger artists a chance instead of sabotaging his own career."
1065,But his new music sounded good though.
1066,"So I'm still listening to the album, even though he had jerk."
1067,You done with him?
1068," I ain't got no word, nothing enough."
1069,I have nothing left to say.

1266," I just tried to stand up for him, you know be everything that he needed."
1267,But I guess that just wasn't enough.
1268,"I was the one taking all the Ls, you know I was the one picking up the pieces and rearranging them you know, making sure that he looked good at all times but I guess for somebody like William Clay Gregory the third, that just wasn't important."
1269,"You know, but, I mean, At the end of the day the money is what talks right?"
1270, Wow.
1271,So did you know that he was cheating on you with Jordan Holmes?
1272," You know, Jay, I didn't want to believe it, but me being me I believed him when he said that it wasn't recent, you know I didn't have any reason not to, so I took his word for it and I kept it moving."
1273,"You know, that's what black women do."
1274, Sounds like you were something special. A real rider.
1275,"I mean, that's how I was raised, you know, with honesty and integrity."
1276,The only good thing that came out of this situation is that Rodney and I was able to start our own label and we were able an sign amazing artist Staci G.
1277,"You know, I got an awesome partner, an awesome artist out of an unfortunate and horrible situation."
1278, I know that's right.
1279,"Now what we really want to know is, did you get the bag from his lying ass?"
1280, Let's just say I am not the unfortunate one okay?

1282,Thank you so much.
1283,Tell us some more about what you got going on.
1284, My pleasure Jay.

1286,She was able to capture some of that raw pain and emotion that I had gone through and was able to put into the song.
1287, Oh so y'all like Jermaine Dupri and Usher with the Confessions.
1288," I mean, I hadn't thought about it, but you can say that."
1289," All right, now we definitely have a special treat for our listeners."
1290,"First let's get into this new Staci G song and maybe after the commercial break, we can get into some more tea about Will Clay and his retirement announcement."

1329,Looks like a shell company.
1330,"Since you didn't make arrangements and you haven't returned my calls for a month, the feds are going to be at your home tomorrow morning to cease property."
