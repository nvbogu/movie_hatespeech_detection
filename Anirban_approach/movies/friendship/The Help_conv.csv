0,"You could argue even, you know, Nick Drake's mystique is a lot to do with him not being around, d'ya know what I mean?"
1,"If Nick Drake was now on Chatty Man with Alan Carr, talking about his new record, that mystique would be dissipated, wouldn't it?"
2,"No, you're absolutely right, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3,"Age shall not wither him, you know what I mean?"
4, He's frozen at that moment.
5, Ian Curtis.
6,"And it's a slender body of work, lan Curtis has got two albums."
7,"And of course, people who never knew the band at the time, guys our age, ""Blimey did you ever see Joy Division?"" I said, ""Yeah, about 30 times, they were always around, I was bored with them,"" but the mystique builds inextricably."
8,"Starting to think that both of us still being here is rather a kind of tired, bourgeois thing to do."
9, What are you saying?
10," I'm not saying anything, mate."
11,"Anyway, this is Findley and Donovan and coming up later, Wobbly Legged Rat, who, if you've been a regular listener to this show, you'll know we're very keen on."
12,"Looking forward very much to seeing them tomorrow, live in Glasgow."
13,"And later on in this show, we have Gabriel and Damascus."
14,"âª I'm bored out my mind âª âª Too sick to even care âª âª I'll take a little walk âª âª Nobody's going to know âª âª I'm in senior ward âª âª It gives you a little free time âª âª I'll just use it all at once âª âª Took the fence and the lane âª âª The bus then the train âª âª Bought an Independent to make me look like I got brains âª âª I made a story up in my head if anybody would ask âª âª I'm going to a seminar âª âª I'm a genius âª âª I'm a prodigy âª âª A demon at maths and science âª âª I'm up for a prize âª âª If you gotta grow up sometime âª âª You have to do it on your own âª âª I don't think I could stand to be stuck âª âª That's the way that things were going âª âª The Bible's my tool âª âª There's no mention of school âª âª My Damascan Road's a transistor radio âª âª I tune in at night when my mum and my dad start to fight âª âª I put on my headphones âª âª And I tune out âª âª I am devout âª âª The girls'll sing about my life âª âª But they're not here, they've got the wild life âª âª If you want to find out, find out âª âª You have to look them in the eye âª âª That's why my only choice âª âª Is find the face behind the voice âª âª I know what they're after âª âª This life is kind of boring âª âª Kids don't want you âª âª He's gotta play the record, hey âª âª The kids are gonna want you âª Thank you, thank you, people."
15,We are Wobbly Legged Rat.
16,This song is for you.
17,"Eins, zwei, drei, vier!"
18,"âª Oh yeah âª Hello, we are King James the Sixth from Scotland."
19,"Yeah, we're just... we're kind of trying that name out, so if you get any ideas, just shout them out."
20,All right!
21,"Come on, get started!"
22,"Right, just..."
23,We want Anton!
24,I want Anton!
25,"âª One fine day, I'm gonna leave this town âª âª I'm gonna run with the deer âª âª I'm gonna swim like a swimming thing âª âª I've had it with this, girl, I've had it with you âª âª At least look at me when I say that we're through âª âª And I'm done âª This is actually..."
26,it's quite a good song if we could play it.
27,All I can hear is the bloody drums.
28,Ow.
29,"Fight, fight, fight!"
30,Fight! Fight! Fight!
31,"You're a bloody tea drinker, pal."
32,You shouldn't be in a band!
33,Are you okay?
34,You're the guy from the fight.
35,My guitar got it worse.
36,You don't look so good.
37,Morning.
38,"I was just gonna come and check your pulse, see if you were still alive."
39,Who are you again?
40,"Oh, James, the guitar player."
41,"So, do you have a job or do you just make money playing guitar?"
42,"No, I work at the university swimming pool."
43, I'm a lifeguard.
44, Lifeguard.
45,"I see, you're always saving people."
46,Grab the ring and just calmly swim back.
47,Here is the safeness.
48,"Yeah, when I get the chance."
49,This is my stop coming up.
50,"So, thank you, lifeguard."
51,I know where to find you.
52,Eve?
53,"Eve, come back here!"
54,"Eve, wait, hey, wait."
55,"Come, come, come here."
56,Let's get her in to one of the single rooms.
57,I'm fine where I was.
58,"Well, you should've thought about that before."
59,"So, we've had the police looking for you."
60,You've wasted our time and the police's time.
61,You've put yourself right back where you started.
62,"So, you're gonna stay in the single room that we've got for you."
63,You'll have no visitors.
64,We're gonna take your phone and your books and you'll have a nurse watching you at all times.
65,"Morning, Eve."
66,Come on.
67,Thank you.
68,Step on for me.
69,Okay.
70,"Okay, this is your life."
71,"People need to start at the bottom and work their way up, okay?"
72,"So, if you don't have the basic things, like food, water, sleep, you can't go anywhere."
73,"Only when you have those, you can proceed up to the next level where you have a home, family, friends, have money to get by."
74,"You have wellbeing, relationships, sex."
75,"And then you could move up to this top layer, where you have art, morality, music."
76,"And these things can catch you if you fall, but if you try going for this top layer first and there's no support, then the whole pyramid just crashes down."
77,"So, it's as simple as that, is it?"
78,"Yup, it is."
79,Don't worry about it.
80,"Your stomach shrunk, it's not used to a full meal."
81,I've been crying all day.
82,It's pathetic.
83,It's maybe not such a bad thing.
84,It's progress.
85,"Two weeks back, you wouldn't have been able to, but now that you're eating again, your body is waking up."
86,You're feeling things again.
87,That's good.
88,And what if everything I'm feeling is shit?
89,That's the hard part.
90,Do you ever think about writing your feelings down?
91,"So, how are you liking it here?"
92,It's fine.
93,It's not like I have anything else important to do at the moment.
94,But you will one day.
95,"All right, that's you're done."
96,"âª Pretty when the wind blows âª âª I love my tree in autumn âª âª Like I love my tree in summer âª âª Like I love my tree in winter âª âª They locked me in a room âª âª And I thought of you in autumn âª âª And I'm sad I won't see you again âª âª Pretty when you sing me a new song in autumn âª âª And a new song in winter âª âª And a new song in summer âª âª Pretty when you put down your bow and come over âª âª With the smell of your breath that I love âª âª With the look in your eye âª âª That I love âª Eve, can you tell me when the last time was that you felt good?"
97,"I don't know, really, I mean, I guess everything sort of started going downhill after I moved away from home, you know?"
98,What did you love when you were young?
99,Um...
100,"I loved reading, I kind of loved being by myself, I suppose."
101,Um...
102,"Watching movies, dressing up."
103,"I know I have to eat, I know how to eat."
104,"I know I wasn't looking after myself, but I'll do okay."
105,Why don't you try for a music school?
106,I could help you with the applications.
107,"Well, I might do one day, but right now, I just wanna get back to life."
108,"But your life before you first came in here was a disaster, so it has to be a different life."
109,"And I've got a plan that involves a gradual reintroduction to your life, combined with a step by step reduction in your pills."
110,And how long's that gonna take?
111,"Enjoying our time in Glasgow, very much so."
112,"They ""Kissing in the Red Zone"" hit makers, we can now say Wobbly Legged Rats are gonna be coming in and doing a live session later in the week, which people are looking forward to enormously."
113,"Come on, fire up."
114,"We look frightened, we don't need to be frightened of them because we're all fucking mental, do you understand?"
115,"They're not mental, they don't have a clue, right?"
116,These are children...
117,"they're beautiful children, but they're children, and we can take them down, do you understand?"
118,Go mental!
119,"Come on, ref."
120,"Oh, right in the fanny."
121,You all right?
122,I'm gonna go and get changed.
123,Eve?
124,Eve?
125,"No, you're absolutely right, yeah, yeah, yeah."
126,"I mean, do you think that, like... I mean the Stones are still around, of course, but, I mean, they do have a dead member."
127,"I mean, obviously, there is a mystique 'cause they did lose one along the way."
128,"It's almost like with Led Zep, isn't it?"
129,"It's almost like unless you've lost one, you don't really kind of..."
130,You're not really the upper echelons of rock 'n' roll.
131, The water looks really good.
132, Jesus!
133,You scared the shit out of me.
134,Eve.
135,At your service.
136,I told you I'd find you.
137,"Wow, you look well."
138,I like your knees.
139,"So, a swim, possibly?"
140,"Oh, yeah, sure, okay."
141,"A quick one though, I have to keep the main light off."
142,Do you have a costume I could borrow?
143,"Yeah, there's some in the office."
144,I'll just...
145,"So, what are you doing here?"
146,I was just playing football against the uni.
147,How's it goin' anyway?
148,"Really good, actually."
149,"Been making music, writing songs and stuff."
150,That's a big bag.
151,"Yeah, I'm kind of in between places."
152,"Ah, well, you know, there is a room in my flat..."
153,"sort of a room, a bit of a room that's free."
154, A bit of a room?
155, Yeah.
156,"I mean, well, it's a separate room, it's just a bit enclosed."
157,"Well, I'm okay with enclosed spaces."
158,"Cool, well, I mean, if you want, I can ask the guy."
159,Okay.
160,"Okay, okay, good."
161,"âª I love my room, I'm getting used to sleeping âª âª Some nights, I really like to lie awake âª âª I hear the midnight birds âª âª A message in their words âª âª The dawn will touch me âª âª In a way a boy could never touch âª âª Their promise never meant so much to me âª Makes him sound like early Joseph Cale."
162,Sounds like the Pastels and everything.
163,"I mean, that is absolutely definitive indie, isn't it, really, I mean the look with the sort of, you know, an anorak and hair that looks slightly like it's been dipped in chip fat, you know?"
164,I used to try and dress like Roddy Frame in 1981.
165,"You didn't get a girlfriend till you were 30, did you?"
166,"Excuse me, hi."
167,Are you guys doing a live session tonight?
168, Yeah.
169, What's your band called?
170,Wobbly Legged Rats.
171,"Oh, yeah, I've heard of you."
172,"If I give you something, could you give it to Findley or Donovan?"
173, Sure.
174, This is really important.
175,They're expecting this tape.
176,I'll give it to them the second I see them.
177,Okay.
178,Did we meet before?
179,"Nope, never."
180,I would have remembered.
181,I am Anton.
182,We play at the Berlin Club in a few days and I can add you to the list if you'd like.
183,"Okay, sure, I'll try and make it."
184,All right.
185,"Just please give them the tape, okay?"
186,Remember to give them the tape.
187, Yes.
188, Thank you.
189,Nice to meet you.
190,She is unbelievable.
191,"Yup, but it's not like she's gonna look at us with all the Swiss Germans here."
192,"No, there's no way she's getting past the big Swiss German."
193,Life is tragic.
194,But good.
195,Eve.
196,I've been out of the city for a while.
197,Maybe you can tell me if I start acting conspicuous.
198,I like conspicuous.
199,Probably take the freakiest thing about you and blow it up.
200, Are your hands cold?
201, No.
202,I bet if I touched your hands they'd be freezing cold.
203,My hands are fine.
204,"Cold, knew it."
205,"I couldn't stand that, I mean, I'd get sick instantly."
206,I've got the constitution of an abandoned rabbit.
207,When did you learn to play?
208,I've always played.
209,Show me something.
210,"âª Grow up, you're nearly 25 âª âª What happened when you were a child âª âª Do you require an analyst âª âª Or will a friendly smile suffice âª âª Find your space, are you breathing well? âª âª Do you feel okay? âª âª Are you calm? âª âª Are you comfortable? âª âª Is your heartbeat racing? âª âª Is this your soul you're facing? âª âª Lay down, my couch is over there âª âª I think you'll find it's way more comfortable âª âª Take off your glasses, don't be scared âª âª For 30 pounds, I'll listen to your stories dear âª âª Shut the window there âª âª We should keep this session intimate âª âª Don't you agree âª âª I have experience in matters similar âª âª I can't juggle, I can't knit a pinafore âª âª But I'll listen to your tale and give you some advice âª âª I was an ace when I was young âª âª I learned to dance, I didn't have to learn âª âª I was a case when I grew up âª âª A case of hope crashing to the ground âª âª I learned, I hit the skids âª âª And I woke up, me, myself and I was a different person âª âª If I take you on, will you be pliable âª âª As a confidante, I'm quite reliable âª âª Dreamer, though you are âª âª It is you that's been my signpost âª âª So far âª Do you often sing to people?"
211,"No, never, really."
212,"Just you, just now."
213, You're very good at it.
214, Thank you.
215,I've been teaching this girl to play guitar.
216,Mmhm.
217,You should come with me some time.
218,And what do you want me to do?
219,Maybe we could work on one of your songs?
220,Or you could help her write something.
221,"I mean, she wants to write, but she doesn't quite have your way."
222,You may have to pretend to be my assistant.
223, Carry your pencils and stuff?
224, Exactly.
225,Some thought should be put in to the matter of what to wear.
226,"Hi, James."
227,"Cassie, this is Eve."
228,Do you mind us hijacking your lesson?
229,"It depends, are you going to make me play scales?"
230,O.
231, Then I don't mind.
232,"So, what would you rather do?"
233,"Well, when I started this, I was hoping we were going to write songs."
234,It does help to know your instrument first.
235,I think sometimes you just need to know the chord you're looking for.
236,"Yeah, but how do you find it?"
237,"Well, maybe we should just try and write a song right now."
238, Okay.
239, Well...
240,"a good song isn't written by committee, I don't know if..."
241,"Cassie, what have you done today?"
242,Just tell me the first thing you did when you got out of bed this morning.
243,"Well, I meant to get up really early, but I was still the last nap and I had to fill the dishwasher 'cause I was last downstairs, which was a ripoff 'cause I didn't get anything to eat."
244,And then what happened?
245,"I jumped in the shower, got dressed."
246,Captain was crying so I had to take her out.
247,She's my dog.
248,"We went to the park, climbed the fence for a shortcut."
249,Anything happen in the park?
250,"Captain was acting strange, she kept running ahead and then got into the herb garden and then she started digging like mad."
251,"âª I got out of bed and came here for adventure âª âª I stepped on a stone on the way âª âª I took off my shoe and a dog came towards me âª âª Wagging his tail happily âª âª Dog, if you could speak, you'd know what to do âª âª Simply turn around and run âª âª Rent a cheap second and crystal ball âª âª I would trust my future to you âª âª Got out of bed when the springs wouldn't have me âª âª Fired me up, like a gun âª âª Fell into my suit and I walked down to breakfast âª âª Green leaves and blue sky and sun âª âª Boy, if you could speak, you'd know what to do âª âª You'd sit and let the world go 'round âª âª Remember all you saw and tell it back in the stories when the day is done âª âª Remember all you saw and tell it back in the stories when the day is done âª My Theory for Applied Music rocked."
252,"We were doing Romeo and Juliet  for English, but I got more into the song, ""Romeo and Juliet."" It's a good song."
253,The guy who wrote that song is a songwriting deity.
254,Did he write any other tunes as good?
255,"One, one and a half."
256,"So, then how can you proclaim him a deus?"
257,"A man needs only write one genius song, one song that lives forever in the hearts of the populous to make him forever divine."
258,"Well, it should be easy then."
259,It's not easy.
260,"Many women and men have lived empty, wasted lives in attics trying to write classic pop songs."
261,What they don't realize is it's not for them to decide.
262,It's God.
263,"Or, the god of music."
264,"Or, the part of God that concerns Himself with music."
265,That's why the hit maker has to be considered part divine because the divine spoke through them.
266,Preposterous notion.
267,But quite a good one.
268,Excuse me for one minute.
269," So, you came."
270," Yeah, I just made it."
271,Sorry I missed your band.
272,Have you been working in a factory or what?
273,"No, I've been waitressing."
274,What are you doing?
275,I have an idea.
276,"Come, come."
277,What is this place?
278,This is where I work sometimes.
279,"Wow, do you own this place?"
280,"No, I don't own it, but I know where all the good stuff is."
281,I could help you pick something to wear.
282, Really?
283," Sure, have a look around."
284,"âª They never met âª âª The singer and the swinger âª âª She walked in âª âª They walked around each other âª âª Fighting for the mirror and smiling âª Nope, that is not for you."
285,This is for another species.
286,"âª I was tongue tied âª You could try it, I suppose."
287,"âª And she aspired to perfection as a hipster âª No, that is not suitable to your shape."
288,Your breasts are exquisite.
289,The dress looks like a potato sack.
290,You're not a potato.
291,"Okay, well, walk forward."
292,Now on your left.
293,"Forward, good."
294,Right.
295,âª I wouldn't waste time âª Warm.
296,Warmer.
297,âª Every second day just dreaming âª Bingo.
298,Try this one.
299,"âª My dream was realized but I was sleeping âª Hey, did you give my tape to those guys?"
300,"Yes, they said they would put it on the pile."
301,Is that all they said?
302,"Well, they said that it was unusual to get a tape these days."
303,Ta da.
304,"âª She passed out cold âª âª Are you okay? âª âª Just lie still âª âª You'll feel better âª âª What happened, I wanna go home âª âª Where am I âª âª What have I done wrong âª âª You say that but how do you know âª âª Who are you? âª âª What do you want? âª âª I always wondered how things could be âª âª I wouldn't waste time dreaming about me âª âª Spend every second day just dreaming how the first one ought to be âª âª My dream was realized but I was sleeping âª âª I was sleeping âª James."
305,James.
306,What is it?
307,What's wrong?
308,Really bad dream.
309,Can I just stay up here for like two minutes?
310,"Yeah, yeah."
311,What?
312,There's water running under the door.
313,"Okay, I've got it."
314,You okay?
315,I'm fine.
316,"Um, I was going to go out for a wander if you want to come."
317,"No, I'm just gonna to stay here."
318,Okay.
319,"âª Pretty Eve in the tub âª âª Please allow me to scrub âª âª Please allow me to rub âª âª Tell me cares of the day âª âª Let me wash them away âª âª All the hideous weight âª âª Dry you gently âª âª Dress you tenderly âª âª And ready for bed âª âª You're asleep still standing up âª âª I like you not made up âª âª You've got a nice face âª âª It is crumpled and creased from the way that you sleep âª âª But I like you the best in one of my vests that you casually keep âª âª Steal from me my underwear âª âª You wear it better than me âª âª Go all day, no false alarms âª âª You charm them all âª âª The worker, labor free shirker âª âª Management lady âª âª Government spy âª âª Long legged girl from the west âª âª You came onto the scene like an energetic beam âª âª Charming ways you have learnt âª âª All the boys have been bent by your mesmerizing gaze âª âª Waltzing into situations âª âª Very kind, getting a raise âª âª Writing home to tell your folks about the city ways âª âª Are nagging at you âª âª What's a girl supposed to do âª âª When a city closes in âª âª Noise from the lady upstairs âª âª She's as deaf as a post âª âª As transparent as a ray âª âª Boys are queuing âª âª Trouble's brewing âª âª But you take it all in âª âª But you take it all in âª âª Ride the wave of their affection âª âª Look behind their gaze and confessions of lust âª âª Pretty Eve in the tub âª âª Please allow me to scrub âª âª Please allow me to rub âª âª Please allow me to scrub âª Why did you want to meet here?"
320,"I have lungs, asthma."
321,When I'm waiting for someone I like to be in tropical Southeast Asia.
322,What's up with you?
323,"Argh, bloody Findley and bloody Donovan ever got back to me."
324,The radio guys?
325, Mmhm.
326, Ah.
327,You expected they would.
328,"Yeah, I hoped that they would."
329,"You know, those guys are not going to go for someone playing and singing acoustic on an old tape."
330,You've got to make it easier for them.
331,They're not going to take a chance on some nutcase.
332,Ow.
333,"You know, you need to write for something, you need to have a reason."
334,"Right, be yourself."
335,Write about yourself.
336,Whatever it is that's happened to you.
337,I thought you said we were going to have some fun tonight.
338,"Ah, we are just getting to it."
339,"Jesus, can you even see?"
340,"Wait, just put..."
341,"okay, put them on, thanks."
342,Thank you.
343,I want to be a councilor.
344,Like a marriage counselor?
345,"No, on the City Council."
346,How do you get that?
347,People have to vote for you.
348,"Oh, no one's going to vote for you, James."
349,You're too feminine.
350,"I used to meet my friend Carol before school, go to meet my boyfriend."
351,What age?
352,Thirteen.
353,Quite advanced for 13.
354,"Good way to start the day, though."
355,Quick snog down at the statues.
356,I like this time of night.
357,Feels like the morning.
358,"I don't know why the birds are going so crazy, they're meant to be in bed, or at least thinking about sleep."
359,They might get randy at this time of year.
360,Maybe they're having a bird disco.
361,"Oh, no way, I know discos are frowned upon in bird society."
362,Oh really?
363,How do you know that?
364,I was a young ornithologist.
365,Cass!
366,Cassie!
367,Cassie!
368,What are you doing?
369,"We're going on a day trip, do you want to come?"
370,Go get dressed.
371,Okay.
372,"Cassie, just come out the front door."
373,"Oh, okay."
374,What is this place?
375,It belongs to the university.
376,You're serious?
377,We're going in that?
378,How does it go?
379,You have to paddle.
380,Where are we going?
381,That way.
382,But what's that way?
383,Are we going through the country or through the city?
384,Are we canoeing through traffic?
385,"Well, you can either go to Edinburgh or you can go to the sea."
386,There's a fork up ahead.
387,"Anyway, it's kayaking, it's not canoeing."
388,We call this canoeing where I grew up.
389,"Yes, well, we're in Scotland now."
390,"Eve, why would you want to come here when it's sunny in Australia?"
391,"Well, because when I finished high school I met this boy who was in a band and I..."
392,What?
393,She's a groupie.
394,Don't listen to James.
395,Was he good looking?
396,Was he really good looking?
397,He was quite good looking.
398,Was he Australian?
399,"He was Australian, but he moved over here with his band."
400,"I guess I followed him, I don't know."
401,"Well, why were you not in the band?"
402,"Well, I wasn't really playing music then."
403,So you crossed multiple continents for a boy.
404,This is weird.
405,You want to go back?
406,"No, it's good weird."
407,I feel like I'm escaping.
408,I feel like Tom Sawyer.
409,We should definitely fake our own deaths.
410,"Oh, excuse me, blondie, I know you."
411,You go to the posh school?
412,Would you go with my pal?
413,Where does he want me to go?
414,I don't understand what you're saying.
415,"Would you go with him, as in go with him?"
416,"Uh... James, paddle."
417,"Oh, I love her, she's an English rose."
418,But I bet she's 30.
419,To deny the ned would be to deny the whole point of this town.
420,What was that?
421,"I'm just saying, this is a ned city now."
422,"It's a Victorian theme park, but it's run by neds."
423,What happened to the Victorians?
424,"They built the city, they used the workforce, then they fucked off with the money."
425,I know more about the city than I would say of the local residents.
426, What?
427, I do.
428,"I study the history of this place, I've..."
429,I have.
430,"Sorry, James, you are English."
431,"No, I'm not."
432,How long after you were born in Scotland did you live in Scotland?
433,"All right, well, I was born here and then after like six months we moved."
434,"Oh, that doesn't count."
435,"If you went to the pub now, around the corner, and you were like, ""Hi, everyone, I'm Scottish,"" someone would punch you in the face."
436,Absolutely.
437,No they wouldn't.
438,Maybe I'd punch them back.
439,We're definitely a band now.
440,Why are we a band now?
441,This is something only a band would do.
442,This is band shit.
443,"Day trips, canoeing, kayaking."
444,"What do you think, James?"
445,"I think we are three people paddling a boat, that's all."
446,So what makes a band then?
447,"You don't make a band, a band makes you."
448,It comes up and sweeps you along.
449,"Do you know what, I think it's possible that all the truly great records have been made anyway."
450,"I mean, what's the point?"
451,Pop music's basically...
452,it's been on the slide since 1969.
453,Do you have any idea what he's talking about?
454,"Not really, but he sounds quite sad."
455,"I'm going to be in Eve's band, and you can either be in it or go back to posting up sad notices in sad cafÃ©s."
456,Thank you.
457,There you are.
458,"So is this a regular thing with you, James, just taking girls on random day trips?"
459,Up until this point I would have said no.
460,I don't believe you.
461,I think it's the one sneaky little move you have.
462,It's a good one.
463,Thank you for helping.
464,"And, thank you as well."
465,What did I do?
466,I don't know.
467,Okay.
468,Steady.
469,"Steady there, me hearties."
470,"You can keep shouting, because as captain of this vessel I'm going to have to knock you out."
471,"James, just chill out."
472,I drank too much wine.
473,We know you did.
474,You still feel like Tom Sawyer?
475,A bit.
476,Like Tom Sawyer when he's drunk.
477,"Hi, this is Dr. Callie Gretty here, please leave a message after the tone and..."
478,"Okay, so what do you want this band to sound like?"
479,"Well, I don't know."
480,"I mean, do you really have to think about it?"
481,Doesn't it just happen?
482,"Mostly it does, depends on what kind of color you want to add to the songs."
483,Do you want it to just be us three?
484,"Yes, I... I don't think I could handle any more people right now."
485,So you don't want any drums?
486,Or a bass?
487,"Well, wouldn't those things just get in the way?"
488,"I mean, wouldn't they choke the sounds?"
489,Isn't that exactly what happened with your band?
490,"Yeah, but those guys were idiots."
491,They... they didn't know what they were doing.
492,Let me just ask you this.
493,"The... the records that you love, would you say they were folk music, classical, jazz, or pop?"
494,Pop music.
495,Then we're gonna need drums and a bass.
496,"Ugh, but I don't want any other people in the band."
497,I think we can make a nice sound.
498,"Ohh, we... we can make a nice sound, yeah, there's no doubt about that."
499,"But let me tell you this, if you want to hear your voice floating in the middle of a beautiful tapestry of frequencies, you're gonna need a pop group."
500,"Oh, okay, I just thought about something."
501,"We get people to play drums or bass or whatever we need, but we tell them right from the start that we're the band."
502,They do what they're told or they can leave.
503,"But I mean, do you think people would actually go for that?"
504,It's not like we're experts or anything.
505,"That doesn't matter, no one knows anything except you."
506,"You're the song writer, you're the boss."
507,So what do we do?
508,Advertise.
509,James can make one of his super cool flyers and I won't steal it like I did last time.
510,"Can you do it, big man?"
511,"Come on, let's go, it's pissing rain."
512,"âª He's a loving kind of guy âª âª He's dedicated to his mate âª âª His choice, he is in love âª âª But temptation always pulls the other way âª âª As he waits, his dream fresh inside his head âª âª His baby is sleeping below âª âª He's a loving kind of guy âª âª He goes to church every day âª âª He's trying to forget âª âª Every day he chips away a little rock on his shoulder âª âª Love is a sculptor and he makes him a shoulder again âª I've got to go to work."
513,Will you come find me and tell me what happens?
514,"Okay, okay, you've got me."
515,"Just sit, sit down."
516,What are you doing here?
517,We're not doing anything.
518,But you've left a trail there.
519,"Okay, listen, shush."
520,Shh!
521,"Calma, shut up."
522,"Listen to the guy, he's got something to say."
523,"If you want to be in the band, got to listen to the guy, okay?"
524,"The handsome guy, hm?"
525,"Okay, this is what we're looking for."
526,There's this place at the university where this other band rehearses and we can borrow their stuff.
527,"Apparently there's twins in the band, and they're both hot."
528,Are you all right?
529,"Yes, I'm fine."
530,"Shit, so we're really gonna do this?"
531,"Eve, your brother's here."
532,You don't have a brother.
533,Hi.
534,One second.
535,What's the deal with the Swiss chap?
536,"The man mountain, the yodeling flingy."
537,The fuckish dilettante.
538,What's a dilettante?
539,"I don't know, one who dabbles?"
540,Has he dabbled?
541,"Oh, he's tried."
542,You let him?
543,I was preparing to let myself.
544,Then he got kind of hypnotized.
545,My cleavage cast a spell over him.
546,Really?
547,Is that usual?
548,"No, absolutely not."
549,I go up and down quite a bit.
550,"Sometimes I quite like them, feel ready to show the world, and other times I just want to tape them up and go running through the barley."
551,How did you get in here?
552,We said we had your inhaler.
553,Can we get your room keys?
554,What are you gonna do in there?
555,We're gonna use your guitar and your keyboard and write a new song.
556,"Okay, but don't go through my stuff."
557,"No way, brother."
558,We might even cook you dinner.
559,What's the song like?
560,"A little bit Osmonds, little bit Bowie."
561,"Oh, oye, no."
562,"Hey, I love him."
563,I'm going through a real phase with him.
564,"Yeah, of course you are, every young girl your age goes through a phase with him, which is fine, it's commendable."
565,What are you talking about?
566,I've never shed a tear to a Bowie record.
567,"Uh, I'm sure he's really going to be upset about that."
568,"Yeah, well, it's important."
569,Music's meant to move you or whether...
570,"Okay, and then, James, can you bring the guitars in?"
571,"One, two, three, four."
572,"âª Come Monday night the day of work is done âª âª Tuesday morning looms âª âª The grey of ordinariness âª âª Start by putting off your chores and all the crushing bores âª âª Say your morning prayers âª âª Sing a rousing song âª âª Then sing it on the long walk home âª âª Come Monday night we're in a state of grace âª âª Twenty million boys are caught up in a paper chase âª âª If the weekend promised much then it failed to touch on a single count what I was hoping for âª âª What I was hoping for âª âª Come Monday night we turn the telly off âª âª To listen to the silence âª âª Light that comes in from outside âª âª If you could catch it all and pin it to your wall âª âª Then you will sleep much better âª âª Baby, you would sleep much better âª âª Maybe you would sleep much better âª âª Baby, you would sleep much better âª âª Maybe you would sleep much better âª âª Baby, you would sleep much better âª âª Maybe you would sleep much better âª âª Baby, you would sleep much better âª âª Maybe you would sleep much better âª So, is the band going to have a name?"
573,"Oh, no, not a name conversation."
574,Why not a name conversation?
575,Don't you think it's stupid just to give yourself a name just because you sing songs?
576,"What, so the Beatles were stupid?"
577,"Well, they were kind of stupid if they actually stopped to think about it."
578,You definitely think too much.
579,You think the fun out of things.
580,"I mean, I... I'm a lifeguard, I work at a pool with three other guys."
581,We didn't give ourselves a name.
582,"What, like the Lifeboys or something?"
583,That's pretty good.
584,"Look, I just don't want to have a name conversation."
585,"It's a Saturday, right now all over this town hundreds of bands just like us are having name conversations."
586,"Thousands of punks, Goths, psychobillies, indie kids, rockers, and just general knobheads are just sitting there arguing about what to call themselves."
587,I think you just hate people.
588,I don't mind people.
589,I just can't stand collective idiocy.
590,"Maybe we should have a name that means something really dirty but nobody knows what it means, like Pearl Jam or something."
591,What... what does Pearl Jam mean?
592,"Well, it's like, you know, it's like spunk."
593, What?
594, Like jizz.
595,after a man's excretion.
596, Ew.
597," What, how is that?"
598,"Because that's like the average amount that a man ejaculates, ten ccs, yeah."
599,Who measures that?
600,"I don't know, scientists."
601, Scientists?
602, Sperm scientists.
603,Ew.
604,A selfabsorbed prat.
605,I suppose with...
606,We're going out.
607,Who's going out?
608,Me and you.
609,O.
610," Yes, we are."
611,Come on.
612,What's happening in here?
613,"Uh, in the Halls, I don't know."
614,We should look in.
615,"âª Baby, it's time to get out âª âª Twenty years incarceration âª âª Twenty minutes of elucidation âª Hey, that's the guys."
616,"You know, the guys are playing on stage."
617,"âª I've got an idea âª âª It's gonna take more than a year âª Come on, let's dance."
618,âª Baby's just waiting for the phone to ring âª Did you know that they played in here?
619,âª Just hopin' for some love âª  Yup.
620, Sneak.
621,âª Please look around you âª We should tell Cassie about this.
622,We should tell Cassie about him.
623,âª You dress like the '50s âª âª You watch I Love Lucy âª âª You fail in every category of what a modern man should be âª Is that Captain there?
624,"Yeah, that's her, Jim."
625,Can I borrow her?
626,"Yes, she's been here for too long anyway."
627,Captain.
628,Go get Cassie.
629,"Ladies and gents, may I introduce Eve Carmichael."
630,"âª Just another Saturday âª âª The boys are dressed up fine âª âª Think I'll wait till half past eight to dress myself divine âª âª Tenthirty I'm in rags âª âª A slutty look accompanies my questionable gaze âª âª Through the strobe light and the haze âª Hey, Captain."

632,Quite a pretty specimen.
633,She's gonna eat him up.
634,"Is it true, they're gonna let us play in a few weeks?"
635,"Yes, it's true."
636,"We could do with a few more songs, though."
637,"Man, we're gonna have our own show."
638,"But you know I'm going on holiday tomorrow, right?"
639,What?
640,Since when? You never said anything about a holiday.
641,"I know, I buried it 'cause I was dreading it, but there's no escape."
642,"A week in Bordeaux with the family, it's gruesome."
643, Hello.
644, Hi.
645,This is James and Cassie.
646,This is Anton.
647,May I talk to you for a minute?
648,Sure.
649,Bye guys.
650,Who the fuck is he?
651,I'm just thinking about my tape that you gave to the radio station.
652,"Mmhm, what of it?"
653,I just think I should do it again.
654,It was too...
655,"I don't know, it feels like a long time ago."
656,I think I could do it much better now.
657,"No, it's okay."
658,How are you to know?
659,It sounded very naive.
660,You listened to it?
661,"Well, yes, briefly."
662,"Wow, you must have listened to it straight after I gave it to you."
663,"Pretty soon, yeah."
664,You had a tape player in the van?
665,"One of the guys had a radio cassette, yeah."
666,So you all heard it.
667,Those that were listening.
668,And this is before you gave it to Findley?
669,I didn't give him the tape.
670,"What, why?"
671,"Well, for a start it was a little embarrassing."
672,What do you mean?
673,"Nobody hands in cassettes, especially not to a radio station."
674,That's not the point.
675,It was from me for him and he would have gotten it.
676,"I don't think so, and you could do better."
677,You said so yourself.
678,Fuck!
679,It was hard to listen to.
680,"You need someone else to play guitar, not you."
681,You need to record with proper equipment.
682,"You know, your words are depressing and selfcentered."
683,"Your songs are... are baby songs, they are songs for children."
684,"You're going to have to learn to take criticism, you know."
685,Fuck you!
686,Where are you going?
687,Church.
688,Why?
689,It's 'cause of the dream I just had.
690,What was the dream?
691,There's nothing more boring than other people's dreams.
692,"No, I want to hear it."
693,I dreamt I was dead and I could look back on everything I'd done.
694,Was I in it?
695,I don't think so.
696,It was like I'd been sent back to pick through all the details of my past with a massive magnifying glass.
697,So what do you think it means?
698,Every moment we have is actually much more important than we take it for.
699,So you're going to church.
700,Just thought I'd go and see if I could get the feeling back.
701,So can I come with you?
702,I'm just going to wander down by myself.
703,I'll see you back here later.
704,James.
705,James!
706,This is Cassie De la Roxfurd.
707,"At the tone leave your name and message, I'll get back..."
708,James!
709,"âª I'm all alone âª âª This is a holiday âª âª Some bloody holiday âª âª My friends have gone away âª âª They're of the temporary sort, I think âª âª I will be better without âª âª As long as you let me out âª âª To taste the air beside the river âª âª I pick the soundtrack âª âª With immaculate care âª âª Such a lot rests upon it âª âª My life upon a song âª âª You don't know how much I need âª âª Musician, please take heed âª âª I thought I might just write a letter âª âª Anything to stay away âª âª From books and lessons today âª âª Besides, it's part of my induction âª âª Into the literate world âª âª I am a literate girl âª âª I lean my love upon you with each line âª âª A gift of improvising removes me from revising âª âª I'll kick this mood off with a change of scene âª âª I bought a leotard and go to the gym âª âª I couldn't get away with wearing it last summer âª âª But I lost a lot of weight âª âª I think it's down to leaving meat out of my diet âª âª As a rule, I won't buy it 'cause it's cool âª âª And if the nighttime threatens me with pain âª âª I will give in to the lust âª âª I will do what I must âª âª I've got a number of a girl I know âª âª Who gets her hallucinogens from a pair of hooligans âª âª I'll take a dose, I don't mind trying âª âª She lets me stay there while I leave the ground âª âª Old episodes of Minder,  I snuggle right beside her âª âª Think that I'll stay till morning âª âª She's got me started yawning âª I want a story with a happy ending."
710,"So you are James, please."
711,How long have you known Eve?
712,"Um, just since the start of the summer."
713,"Ah, and you are the boyfriend?"
714,"No, uh, I'm the friend."
715,Ah.
716,How's she doing?
717,"She's okay, now."
718,Did you know that Eve was in here before?
719,Yeah.
720,She left too soon.
721,"I advised her she wasn't ready, but she didn't listen."
722,Did she ever talk about her illness?
723,But you figured it out?
724,If you listen to the songs.
725,The songs.
726,How did you know where I was?
727,"Uh, it was me that brought you in."
728,Eve Alexander Carmichael.
729,What the hell happened to you?
730,What do you mean?
731,All that day.
732,Where were you? You said you were coming home.
733,"Well, I don't... I don't tell you everything."
734,"I mean, it's not like you tell me anything."
735,"Okay, I should leave you to get some rest."
736,"Nononono, don't go, please."
737,I've had enough rest.
738,Are you gonna be okay?
739,"Like, I mean, do you want me to do anything?"
740,"Just come and see me, okay?"
741,And maybe bring Cass sometimes if she can bear it.
742,"You've had a setback, a predictable one."
743,"I mean, you must've had some good times this summer."
744,Yeah.
745,What about finishing your college application?
746,I think you're ready.
747,"âª My room faces north âª âª But the sun's in the south âª âª I'm just waking up to the news of my birth âª âª I am a girl, and I'm lucky to be here âª âª Whatever that's worth âª âª Like an ostrich, I lived with my head in the sand âª âª I slipped into corners, I sat on my hands âª âª I learned to stifle the shouts and the outrage I'm feeling deep down âª âª With my chains falling off and the hope in a friend âª âª Cafes and walkways and sculptured weekends âª âª I am getting to love my freedom âª âª I am getting to like my surroundings âª âª My room faces north âª âª But the sun's in the south âª âª You are far out of reach âª âª Could I be any worth to some special person? âª âª My mind is unknowing of any such luck âª âª So I yell out the window âª âª Answer the mail âª âª My diary is quiet âª âª The definitive nail in my social coffin âª âª I blame all the boffins for making me fail âª âª For an hour in the park or an hour on the couch âª âª With the boy of my choice if he makes me go ""Ouch!"" âª âª I will swap all my dumb school prizes âª âª I'm open to dark surprises âª âª My room faces north âª âª But the sun's in the south âª âª You are far out of reach, perfect hand, perfect mouth âª âª I'll barter my freedom, I'll trade all my medals âª âª Please keep me in dreams âª âª I don't want commitment, I don't want the drama âª âª I just want your dreams âª âª I just want your genes âª Are you sure you want me to sing it?"
748,"Of course, I couldn't sing it like that."
749,I wrote it for you.
750,And do you think we might do that one at the concert?
751,"Absolutely, we need that song."
752,"I don't know, James."
753,"If you two don't get together, then every song and every film and every book I've ever heard, seen, and read are wrong."
754,It's different for us.
755,She makes songs.
756,She writes them.
757,She's a character in them.
758,"It's her world, and it's her private place, and it's the only thing that really means anything to her."
759,I don't suppose there's ever been so much repression of true feelings since Stalinist Russia.
760,Letter!
761, Hi.
762, Hi.
763,Are you okay?
764,"Yeah, I'm fine."
765,Are you okay to be here?
766,"Yeah, they know I'm here."
767,They let you out pretty late.
768,Uhhuh.
769,Um.
770,I think I might go to college.
771,Music school in London.
772,What do you think about that?
773,"Um, I think, why would you do that?"
774,"Well, why not?"
775,'Cause you're already better than anyone there.
776,"'Cause if any of the teachers at this college had a fifth of your talent, they wouldn't even be there."
777,Because they're just gonna try and make you sound like some asshole from TV.
778,"Well, I need to go somewhere."
779,"O, you don't."
780," Yes, I do."
781,"I do, okay."
782,I need order.
783,And I need structure.
784,And I need people.
785,Grown up people.
786,"I mean, what are you gonna do?"
787, What does that mean?
788," What are you gonna do, you're just gonna sit around here for the next ten years getting more tired and fed up with everything?"
789,"You say we can make records, how can we make records?"
790,You need money to make the kind of records you wanna make.
791,"And even then, who's gonna listen to them?"
792,You're the only person that wants to hear them.
793,"Well, what's wrong with that?"
794,You can't make records for anyone else.
795,"I mean, I don't care if we made a record and no one bloody listened to it as long as it was a record that we wanted to make."
796,"Well, I can't have that, James."
797,Okay?
798,"I just, I've been inside my own head for way too long."
799,"I want to sing, and I wanna dance, and I wanna meet new people, and I don't wanna look back."
800,Look.
801,"I like you, and I like Cass."
802,I mean...
803,I love you and Cass.
804,I'm just not going back in that room.
805,And I'm not going back to the hospital.
806,You have to go back tonight.
807,You know what I mean.
808,"I'm gonna take these wet jeans off, okay?"
809,Thank you.
810,What's the point in that?
811,What?
812,"I mean, the time for that was ages ago."
813,When you were shagging Anton?
814,No.
815,"What, when you were so mental you couldn't even get dressed properly?"
816,Maybe.
817,Maybe I didn't fancy you then.
818,You fucking did.
819,James.
820,Mm?
821,I wanna tell you something else.
822,"At the start of the summer, just before I left the hospital, this woman came to cut hair, and when it was my turn, out of the blue she just started talking to me and telling me that she healed people while she cut their hair."
823,You didn't think she was just some nut?
824,"By that time I was a nut's best friend, remember?"
825,"So anyway, a couple of weeks ago when I wasn't doing so well I went to her house."
826,So did she cut your hair again?
827,"No, she..."
828,she told me to lie down.
829,She had this massage couch.
830,She put a blanket over me and she told me that she practiced Christian healing.
831,"And I said, ""What if you don't believe in Jesus?"" She said it would still do me good."
832,You don't believe in Jesus?
833,"Well, I know he was a man, I just don't know how much of the story to believe."
834,"So, anyway, I shut my eyes, and I imagined the desert, you know, like a Christmas card with camels in."
835,"And then I thought, ""What if the woman's hands were his hands, would that help me?"" And nothing happened."
836,But then...
837,"my eyes were tight shut, but I..."
838,"I know this sounds stupid, but I felt like there was a man standing over me."
839,"And I was too scared to open my eyes up, I couldn't move."
840,"It was a strange moment, but it was like I knew that this was my chance, like, like I could decide my own fate."
841,"So I started saying to myself, ""I want to be better."
842,I want to be well.
843,"I want to be better, I want to be well."" Over and over."
844,And I suppose that was a prayer.
845,"After, did you feel any better?"
846,"I mean, a few days later I started feeling much worse."
847,"You know, seriously panicking, paralyzed in bed."
848,What about now?
849,I feel...
850,different.
851,It's like she sort of cleaned me out or something.
852,"Um, do you think you'll still play the show?"
853,"Yeah, I will."
854,Just don't...
855,"don't tell Cass I'm leaving, okay, just not yet."
856,Okay.
857,"It was that sort of scrubby, huge Jiffy bag on reception."
858,"Opened it, what did we find in there?"
859,The world's last cassette.
860,The world's last cassette.
861,"We had to roam the streets looking for an old car and break into it with a wire coat hanger, and play the cassette in the car, and then we got arrested."
862,"Which means even if I could, I can't get along to the old school house where God Help the Girl is playing."
863,"But anyway, you have a good gig, don't worry about us."
864,Onetwothreefour.
865,"âª I fried my head, I'm not a brunette âª âª I'm a down and dusky blonde âª âª I am living in a tree âª âª When I lie in bed I see âª âª Beyond my brother's head, the moon, I hear the rain âª âª I am conscious of my voice as a tool, it's more demure âª âª Than your friend, the singing queen âª âª With her matinee good looks âª âª She talks like talking from a book âª âª I speak the language of my village, of my street âª âª But I need a friend, and I choose you âª âª I'll tell you the way I feel âª âª The truth is crushing like a heel âª âª I will forget the kiss and feel if you will, too âª âª It's drag that you're getting old âª âª I'd love to think about the year âª âª When we sobbed, and then we cheered âª âª The town deserted like a film âª âª Your torso crushing me âª âª Into the country âª âª And the tunnels, and the fields âª âª I read a book a day like an apple âª âª But I did not eat âª âª And so the doctor came to me âª âª She said, ""A woman does not live âª âª By the printed word âª âª Forgive yourself and eat"" âª âª Autumn sped along outside âª âª Trick photography on speed âª âª I was locked inside a room âª âª They made a deal, they would control âª âª The simple things like bodies âª âª But I kept my soul âª âª When I needed someone I chose you âª âª Because the fledgling soul awakes âª âª And on the balcony she quakes âª âª And she is waiting for the sign âª âª And when her brother does not come âª âª And when the sister's much too young âª âª She chooses you âª Just wait one minute, and I'll walk you down."
866,"Okay, I get that most of the things that Eve says about me are true."
867,I think she thinks I'm too opinionated and bitter.
868,I know she thinks I just wanna be comfortable.
869,But what's so bad about that?
870,At least it's an ambition.
871,I just want a period of controlled happiness.
872,"Yeah, but you do it at the expense of living, of all experimentation, of all..."
873,"Wai... wait a minute, you don't get to come in here."
874,"I'm telling my side of the story, I've been waiting all summer to do it."
875,"Okay, sorry."
876,I've always dreamed of making a record.
877,I've always dreamed that I could place a small flag in the timeline of pop history.
878,"This might seem preposterous to you, but you know what?"
879,"Fuck off, this is my dream."
880,"I just wanted to play a part, but I never thought I could till Eve came along."
881,Never came close.
882,"Without wanting to sound blasphemous, I am the voice crying in the wilderness, and she is my Messiah."
883,"I might not be fit to tie her musical boot laces, but I could've helped her make records."
884,I could've listened to her songs and backed her up on simple yet accurately played guitar.
885,"I could've designed the sleeves, distributed the flyers, licked the envelopes, whatever, I would've done it."
886,"Eve may go on to greatness, but according to me the greatness already happened this summer."
887,The greatness of this summer came from somewhere else.
888,"Just for a moment we were all in the right place, and the possibilities were infinite."
889,Now I'll go back to my room.
890,Eve will get on the train to a grown up life free from neurosis.
891,"Cassie will wonder for a few moments, ""What the hell just happened?"" before she gets torn back into her own living delights and active miseries."
892,And I'll go back to my room.
893,Was she on it?
894,Yeah.
895,Do you want a lift?
896,Yeah.
