622,It felt like a breast.
623,Didn't it feel like an arm?
624,"An arm? No, it felt like a breast."
625,I'll bet it felt like an arm.

627,Because it was an arm.
628,What's the matter with you?
629,You were feeling her arm.
630,That's what i was trying to tell you.
631,You squeezed an arm for 11 minutes.

641,Why didn't you let me think It was a breast?
642,I thought you should know So you wouldn't make that mistake again.
643,You wanted to ruin my memory of it.
644,What do i care If you spend your life squeezing arms?
645,"I thought you should face reality, Especially if you're timing it And going for records."
646,I guess you're right.
647,"Oh, god!"

780,She used to be...
781,Watch that step.
782,"Ok, ok."

806,I don't want to just lay her. I respect her.
807,There's something you have to understand.
808,"It's alright to respect her, But she won't respect you If you don't try to lay her."
809,I don't believe that.
810,It's true.
811,My brother told me.
812,That's the way ladies are.
813,They want you to try even if they don't let you.
814,"Because even though they don't let you, they want you to."
815,I think i understand.
816,Good. Then you can start memorizing.
817,"Oh, this is crazy."
818,What?
819,Point 3.
820,What's crazy about it?
821,I've never heard of the word.
822,LatinThe original guys were latins.
823,I wouldn't know how to pronounce it.
824,"You don't pronounce it, you just do it."
825,I don't know where it is.
826,What the hell is this in number 4?
827,"That's latin, too."
828,"It's all in latin, hermie."
829,I may have to ask where these things are.
830,They're all approximately in the same place.
831,"""Seek and ye shall find."" Besides, she's supposed to help you out."
832,I hope so. I'll need all the help i can get.
833,"Point 6, hermie Very important."

836,"Well, i still don't know what to do."
837,What do i say?
838,"""How about a little foreplay?"" You don't have to say a word."
839,"Oh, yeah?"
840,Point 2 states we should converse.
841,"When you get to point 6, there's no more talking, Just moaning and sighing."
842,Just moan and sigh.
843,"Well, she'll think i'm sick."
844,"She'll be moaning and sighing, too."

848,"Once she gets started, she's supposed to be something."
849,"I'm home, hermie."
850,"If i follow these 12 points, She might have a kid."
851,"I can't afford a kid, At this stage."
852,So the whole thing's off.
853,"Hermie, you are really dumb."
854,"I may be dumb, but i won't be a father."
855,"Two wrongs, don't make a right."
856,You use protection.

1164,Don't plan on it.
1165,No.
1166,Getting late.
1167,I've got to get to the post office And get these letters off.
1168,I'll run them down for you.
1169,"No, thanks."
1170,"It's tricky postage, Overseas and all."
1171,Thanks anyway.
1172,Hello!
1173,I don't even know your name.
1174,"Oh, dorothy."
1175,I had a cat named dorothy.
1176,It got hit by a truck.
1177,Bye!
1178,Hi.
1179,You know what?
1180,What?
1181,It's all over.
1182,What?
1183,Me and miriam.
1184,What happened?
1185,I'm embarrassed to tell you.
1186,Then don't tell me.
1187,You won't believe it.
1188,"After last night, i'll believe anything."
1189,No. It's not what you think.
1190,"Look, oscy."
1191,I'm in kind of a hurry.
1192,We had an argument this afternoon.
1193,I went over to her house to apologize.
1194,She's got appendicitis.
1195,Took her over to the mainland.
1196,Hope they leave her there.
1197,I hope they don't cut up her boobs.
1198,I don't think the scar goes that far.
1199,She told me she's breaking our date.
1200,"The next thing i know, appendicitis."
1201,She goes to extremes.
1202,They loaded her on the speedboat on a stretcher.
1203,Maybe it's all for the better.
1204,How can you say such a dumb thing?
1205,Because i'm not really interested.
1206,Bullshit.
1207,You're interested.
1208,You took a long look at us last night.
1209,We knew you were looking.
1210,I only caught a glimpse.
1211,Will you shut up oscy.
1212,I don't want to hear your dirty details.
1213,You don't want me to tell you?
1214,I don't wanna hear about it.
1215,I was gonna tell you everything.
1216,Don't.
1217,"When you want to hear, i won't tell you."
1218,Good.
1219,Something's wrong with you.
1220,You're not normal.
1221,Good.
1222,Going to her house?
1223,Screw you.
1224,Got your instructions handy?
1225,It won't be like that.
1226,You wouldn't understand it.
1227,Because you're so crass.
1228,Crass? What the hell is crass?
1229,Just leave me alone.
1230,What are you so mad about?
1231,I don't know!
1232,Got your rubbers?
1233,You're a regular comedian.
1234,You know what?
1235,I'm sorry i tried to help you.
1236,That makes two of us.
1237,I gave you my binoculars to get you educated.
1238,Word's getting out you're a homo.
1239,"If you don't cut it out, You'll get a fat lip!"
1240,Ah!
1241,Homo!
1242,Hello?
1243,Hello?
1244,Hello?
1245,Hello?
1246,Hello?
1247,"Dorothy, it's hermie, Hermie from the beach."
1248,"Hi, hermie."
1249,Hi.
1250,"I don't look very nice, do i?"
1251,I think you do.
1252,I think i don't.
1253,I'm sorry.
1254,"Good night, hermie."
1255,Good night.
1256,Miriam pulled through.
1257,I talked to her mother this morning.
1258,Jesus. They didn't even operate.
1259,They froze her.
1260,I'm relieved about it.
1261,But she's through for the summer.
1262,Won't be back on the island again.
1263,My first lay...
1264,gone with the wind.
1265,"Hey, have you seen benjie anywhere?"
1266,That rat still has my glasses.
1267,"Hey, you know, you shouldn't feel so bad, No matter what happened."
1268,You don't have to tell me.
1269,"But if you want to tell me, you can."
1270,You don't have to unless you want to.
1271,Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass.
1272,"Hey, i thought maybe we'd attack The coast guard station tonight."
1273,"You know, give them a scare?"
1274,"""Dear hermie, i must go home now."
1275,"""I'm sure you'll understand."
1276,"""There's much i have to do."
1277,"""I won't try and explain what happened last night ""Because i know that, in time, ""You'll find a proper way in which to remember it."
1278,"""What i will do is remember you, ""And i pray that you be spared all senseless tragedies."
1279,"""I wish you good things, hermie, ""Only good things."
1280,"Always, dorothy. "" I was never to see her again, Nor was i ever to learn what became of her."
1281,We were different then.
1282,Kids were different.
1283,It took us longer to understand the things we felt.
1284,"Life is made up of small comings and goings And for everything we take with us, There is something that we leave behind."
1285,"In the summer of '42, We raided the coast guard station four times."
1286,We saw five movies and had nine days of rain.
1287,"Benjie broke his watch, oscy gave up the harmonica, And in a very special way I lost hermie... forever."
