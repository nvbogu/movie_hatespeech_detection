0, Joanna 'Cause she was black.
1,"It was during segregation, they didn't treat African Americans then."
2,They didn't have any black blood.
3,"And if she hadn't been black, she wouldn't be dead 'cause they woulda had blood for the white people."
4,"If we had the right to vote back then, I think my mother would have lived and I would have known her."
5," Narrator To millions of Americans, the long fought battle for voting rights culminated on Bloody Sunday when 600 courageous marchers were attacked by police on horseback as tear gas and screams filled the air."
6,"Selma, the Edmund Pettus Bridge, forever ingrained in American history."
7,Monuments to a struggle.
8,Everyone can now vote.
9,So what happened?
10,What happened after Selma?
11, Selma has been locked into the American imagination as this place of voting rights strength.
12,But what gets missed is it freezes Selma in time.
13,And so you don't see what happened to Selma afterwards.
14,You don't see the massive white flight.
15,You don't see the shutting down of the businesses.
16,You don't see the massive unemployment.
17,You don't see the kind of economic despair that has happened in Selma.
18,"So yes, that power of the right to vote, but that's not the fully story of Selma."
19,"And that kind of resentment and retrenchment that we see happening in Selma, the decay that we see happening there."
20,"You get a wealthy white area in Selma, and then you get the rest of Selma."
21,That is so indicative of the United States of America right now.
22,It looks like it's working.
23,"I mean we see that we have elections, we see that people go to the polls, we see that people cast their ballots, we see the kind of horse race as the percentage of the votes are coming in and they're tallying up, and so it looks like it's all working."
24,But it's not.
25," Narrator It's not working because, like Selma, the right to vote has decayed over the years through legislative maneuvering in order to disenfranchise massive portions of the population."
26,The same population that was fighting for those very rights all the way back in 1965.
27,The unspoken reality is that America was always a country by white people for white people.
28,"But as a nation that is becoming browner, an existential threat to the established order."
29,"It's also important to understand that voter suppression is not driven by party, it is driven by ideology."
30,"And with the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the Republican party saw a political opportunity that, to its own detriment, couldn't resist."
31," As the Republicans wooed the southern Democrats in, what they thought they were doing was getting additional representatives in the south that could help them in Congress with the votes to be able to push forward a conservative agenda."
32,"Y'know, small government, et cetera."
33,"But when you woo the toxin of white supremacy in, it cannot be contained."
34,"It is a virus, it is toxic, and it took over."
35," Narrator The party of Lincoln had a tenuous control of the south, at best."
36,That was enforced by the military during Reconstruction.
37,"More than 1,500 African American men held office throughout the south."
38,"But the gains made after would be nullified with the Compromise of 1877, a backroom deal allowing Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, to be president, and for the removal of federal troops from the south, ceding it back to the Democrats who, in turn, starting with the 1890 Mississippi constitution, would usher in Jim Crow and segregation."
39,"The signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a Democratic president caused a shift in party allegiance among white voters who felt their segregationist way of life was under attack."
40,The staunchly Democratic south would become Republican.
41, Joanne All these stores were thrivin'.
42,"We had Ben and Kay, we had Butler's Shoes, we had Zales, we had all those chain stores was down here."
43,It was a thrivin' community.
44,This used to be a shoe store and I had a bad experience in there 'cause I tried on shoes and didn't know it.
45,I wasn't supposed to try on shoes.
46,"We were standin' in front of Carter's drug store, it's still in Selma today, alive and well, but at that time Carter's had a lunch counter."
47,"And I wanted to sit there, but my grandmother said I couldn't."
48,"She said colored children, that's what we were called, can't sit there at the counter, it's the law."
49,It didn't stop me from wanting to sit there.
50,"Every time I pass by it, be peepin' in that window, watchin' those white kids spinnin' around on those stools and it looked like so much fun."
51,"Well, one day my grandmother was talkin' to one of her friends at front of the store and I was doin' what I always do, peepin' that window, wishin' it was me."
52,"This particular day my grandmother noticed and she leaned over my shoulder, she pointed through the window to the counter, she said when we get our freedom, you can do that too."
53,I became a freedom fighter that day.
54, Voter suppression is not just a southern phenomenon.
55,"It allows them a level of comfort, some level of patting oneself on the back to go oh, those southerners."
56,But this is nationwide.
57,It is doggone near from sea to shining sea.
58,"We see it in Wisconsin, we see it in North Dakota, we see it as well in Alabama, in Florida, in Texas."
59,"We see it in Kansas, we see it in Ohio, we see it in Michigan, we see it in Pennsylvania."
60,"Pennsylvania's not the south, Michigan is not the south."
61,Ohio is not the south.
62," Narrator In fact, 33 states, 2/3 of the country, have some form of voter suppression under the guise of protecting the integrity of the vote."
63,"But as history has shown, voter suppression has never been about integrity, but about preserving the right to vote exclusively for whites."
64,"Following the Civil War, the 15th Amendment prohibited the barring of anyone from the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
65,"To get around that, states used societally imposed conditions instead of race as the litmus test to vote."
66,The poll tax and literacy test.
67,"Newly freed African Americans had no money, and only 3% could read or write."
68,"And if that didn't work, then there was always the tools of terror."
69,"As Mississippi senator Theodore Bilbo often stated, the best way to keep an nword from voting was to visit him the night before."
70,"By 1940, in places like Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, more than half of the African American adults had less than five years of formal education."
71,"It's not too hard to imagine, then, that only 3% of all black adults in the south were eligible to vote."
72,"Underfunding black education, poverty, voter intimidation, and outright murder had laid waste to the 15th Amendment."
73,"In Selma, it resulted in less than 1% of the African American population registered to vote in a city that was over 50% black."
74," Joanne And did you know that these streets, you see the sidewalk?"
75,And see how it's up and down?
76,"Well, the white people walked up top, black people walked on the bottom."
77,"And those benches, that used to be the only place in Selma that black people could sit."
78,All that was allowed.
79,They had nowhere to go to the bathroom.
80,That's a good question.
81,"Voting rights, where are we with voting rights?"
82,"Man, that voting must be awfully valuable, I promise you, 'cause every time I turn around, somebody tryin' to take somethin' from it."
83,"Some people think that we had the right to vote, everything would be, it was, after that was fine, right?"
84,It wasn't.
85,"Even after that, for every gain that we made, we had to fight for it, even today."
86,"So let's just get rid of that thought that, and then we ended up African American president and you know the world, the whole world has changed."
87,No.
88," In that 2016 election, black voter turnout had declined by 7%."
89,Now this was a close election.
90,And the narrative that we received was y'know black people just didn't show up.
91,And you know why they didn't show up?
92,'Cause they just weren't feelin' Hillary.
93,"Y'know, Hillary is uh, she's Hillary."
94,"She doesn't have Obama's charisma, she doesn't have his magic, she doesn't have his skills, and she know she's Hillary."
95,So they just didn't show up.
96,"Well, that's not quite accurate."
97,"This was the first election in 50 years, presidential election in 50 years without the protections of the Voting Rights Act."
98," Narrator To really understand this, we have to go back to the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush."
99,"While the carnival atmosphere of Florida's hanging chads dangle like a specter over the election results, the real danger was lurking nearly 800 miles away in St. Louis, Missouri."
100,"It was there that Senator Kit Bond cried voter fraud after Democrats protested the illegal purging of nearly 50,000 registered voters."
101,It would become the rallying cry that would plant the seed for massive voter suppression.
102," So in this legislation, with the reality of all that had happened with machines that didn't work, with intimidation and no place to complain, this law was putting in place ways to deal with that debacle, the reality of that debacle."
103,"He added, Kit Bond insisted on adding the fiction of voter fraud into federal law."
104,And that meant that now you had sitting in federal law that states could require voter ID.
105, Which was the poison pill.
106, Which was the poison pill.
107, Narrator But voter ID would only be one of many levers which a party could pull to suppress the vote and change the results.
108,"Combined with voter purging, mass incarceration, gerrymandering, and the closing and moving of polling locations, this lethal cocktail would alter our democracy."
109," Joanne When I look at some of these trees, I just wish they could talk."
110,I can see my ancestors really strong up at these trees.
111,"It's sad, this whole place, this whole thing is makin' me sad."
112,Was this necessary?
113,"When I say that, I mean, why did it take a war to make people realize that we should be free?"
114,"People ask us why we livin' in the past, that was then and this is now."
115,"Okay, what's different?"
116,"I'm not in the street watchin', I don't see much different."
117,We're fighting for the right to vote in then.
118,We were fighting for basic human rights then.
119,Aren't we still doin' the same thing now.
120,So don't tell me it was then.
121,"It might be then for you, but see I have not, if you progress, you forgot to take me."
122," Barack Obama, a black man, was elected president of the United States."
123,"Now, one of the things that we hear, because this was repeated at 2012, one of the things we hear is how racist can America be?"
124,We elected a black man twice to the White House.
125,"Well, it's not quite accurate."
126,Because wouldn't that have said it means how racist can white Americans be because we white Americans elected a black man twice to the White House.
127,But the majority of whites who have voted have not voted for a Democratic candidate for president since 1964.
128, Narrator Barack Obama brought 15 million new voters to the polls.
129,"They were overwhelmingly African American, Asian American, Hispanic, young, and poor."
130,A coalition that would be the hit list for what would become voter suppression laws.
131,"By 2012, over 180 bills restricting voting rights appeared in 41 states."
132,Senator Lindsey Graham at the 2012 Republican National Convention said out loud what everyone was thinking.
133,"The demographic race we're losing badly, Republicans were not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term."
134,The landmark Shelby versus Holder Supreme Court decision in 2013 changed elections forever.
135,It ruled Section 4(b) unconstitutional.
136,Section 4(b) of 1965 Voting Rights Act required free clearance for those states that wanted to implement any changes or that demonstrated a history of racial bias.
137,"Chief Justice Roberts wrote that our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problems speaks to current conditions and that Congress' reasoning for Section 4(b) was based on 40 year old facts, having no logical relationship to the present day and thus is not responsive to current needs."
138,"In short, racism is over."
139," So, in the 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, it came out in evidence that from 19, starting in 1982 that the Department of Justice had stopped over 700 attempts by the states to implement racially discriminatory voting laws."
140,So all preclearance stopped over 700 attempts.
141,"So when John Roberts is looking saying ah that discrimination is a thing of the past, we're talking in the 21st century where there is evidence before the U.S. Supreme Court about racial discrimination."
142,And the court chose to ignore it.
143,"Two hours, with just two hours after the Shelby County vee Holder decision is implemented, boom Texas right off the bat implements its voter ID law."
144," Narrator Texas voter ID law SB 14 allowed for a limited number of IDs, which white people are more likely to carry."
145,"In particular, a gun license."
146,"But it also included a drivers license, which sounds innocuous enough until you realize that nearly 1/3 of the counties in Texas do not have a DMV, including some that are heavily minority."
147,"For many, it would require a 250 mile round trip visit to the DMV to obtain in ID."
148,"Nearly 600,000 black, Latino, or poor voters who were already registered did not have required ID, in addition to one million who were not registered also lacked it."
149,"And because any language providing reimbursement by the state was stripped out of the bill, voter ID in Texas became a modern day poll tax."
150,The voter ID law in Texas was not an isolated incident.
151,"According to the state of Indiana, only 1% of the eligible population did not have the required identification which amounted to 43,000 citizens."
152,"However, an independent study found the number was not 1%, but 16%, and that whites were 11.5 percentage points more likely than African Americans to already have the acceptable ID."
153,"But in places like Marion County, where 200,000 of the state's black population lives, there was a catch 22 at play."
154,"To get the required ID, you had to have a birth certificate."
155,"And to get the birth certificate, you needed the required ID."
156,"In Georgia, HB 244 required an ID from the Department of Driver Services, but 1/3 of the state's counties did not have a bureau."
157,"And in Atlanta, with a population exceeding 480,000 residents, of which nearly 60% are people of color, there was not a single office."
158,North Carolina's voter registration amongst African Americans increased 51% in the 21st century.
159,"And their voter turnout rate in the 2008 and 2012 elections were higher than that of whites, so Republican legislators learned which IDs favored white voters and required at those."
160,Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote that the law clearly had a discriminatory intent.
161,"In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker promoted a bill that would require an ID and then went about closing motor vehicle offices in Democratic areas, but extending the hours in those areas that favored Republicans."
162,"As author Jeremiah Goulka observed, this was in a state in which half of blacks and Hispanics are estimated to lack a driver's license and 1/4 of its DMV offices are open less than one day per month."
163,"In Alabama, after their voter ID law was passed, it wasn't Governor Robert Bentley who came up with the idea to close the DMVs in 31 predominantly black counties as a way to save money, but Rebecca Mason's, his aide and mistress."
164,"When challenged, Bentley finally agreed to allow those offices to open for one day a month."
165," Joanne Green Street Baptist Church is a church that, a historic church in African American community and to just let that beautiful old church just go, it's horrific."
166,"But there's also the rest of the town that is in, looks like Green Street too in a lot of places."
167,"If we continue on this road, the road we're goin' as of today, I don't know how Selma's gonna survive."
168,What's goin' on with this yard?
169,"All of this is poverty, all of this."
170,It's sad.
171,"It was a thriving community and when we had mass white flight, white people left."
172,"They left the houses, put up for sale signs some of 'em, some of 'em rented the houses and then didn't even bother to keep them up."
173,"Y'know, they're not here anymore so it doesn't matter."
174,"And then they tell the world that you ran it down when you didn't, it was already runnin' down."
175,"I can't, in all fairness, blame white flight on everything that even when you're downtrodden, you don't have to live like you're downtrodden."
176,"You don't have to, you pick up the trash."
177,You don't put trash in your yard.
178,"Now, it'll be a month or so before the city just come and pick that up."
179,That's ridiculous.
180,"Look at this house, it has so much character."
181,Dang.
182, Narrator Alabama's poverty is striking and ranked near the bottom of every index.
183,"While 14% of whites live below the poverty line, that number jumps to 34% for Latinos and 31% for African Americans."
184,"In nearly half of Alabama's black belt counties, the conditions are those you would find during the Great Depression."
185,A United Nations report on extreme poverty found large portions of the black belt had no waste disposal infrastructure.
186,"For the poor, registering to vote is extremely difficult."
187,"Alabama ranks 48th in the nation for inner city transportation in a state with a rural population of 844,000."
188,Nearly 14% of black households compared to 4% of whites do not have access to a vehicle.
189,"The state pretended to solve the problem by allowing for online registration, but 56% of the rural population does not have access to the internet."
190,"A mobile registration unit was created but issued only 5,070 voter cards out of the 250,000 they knew would be required."
191,"In addition, they also closed nearly 7% of their precincts."
192,"And despite African Americans making up 71% of those who hold a government issued public housing ID, it was excluded on the approved list."
193,"According to Alabama's Secretary of State, John Merril, the problem was very clear."
194,"If you're too sorry or lazy to get up off your rear and to go register to vote, or to register electronically and then go vote, then you don't deserve that privilege."
195,"Of course, voting is not a privilege in America."
196,It is a right.
197," And again, this is gonna sound really reasonable, and that would be that periodically, the Secretary of State would go through and remove those who had died, because you don't want dead folk voting, who would remove those who had moved out of the district."
198,"So say you had been in Georgia and now you move to California, you shouldn't be on the rolls in Georgia if you're livin' in California now."
199,"So again, it sounds reasonable."
200,And it says that you can't be removed simply because you haven't voted.
201,Reasonable.
202,But that reasonableness in the hands of secretaries of state has created massive damage.
203, Narrator The damage is staggering.
204,"Between the 2012 and 2016 election, which represents a 33% increase between the 2008 and 2012 elections."
205,"In the run up to the 2018 election, Georgia became the epicenter over voter purges and their use it or lose it laws because the person in charge of controlling who gets to vote was one of the candidates running for governor."
206,The then Secretary of State Brian Kemp purged nearly 1.2 million names from the rolls.
207,"On the eve of the election, his office lost the registrations of 40,000 Georgians and placed 85,000 more under investigation of which only 25 were found to have problems."
208,The majority of these new voters were people of color.
209,"In the end, Kemp defeated his Democratic rival, Stacey Abrams, by just 54,723 votes."
210,Purging of voter rolls went supernova when Kris Kobach became Kansas' Secretary of State in 2011 and inherited a little known program called Interstate Crosscheck.
211,"Today, Crosscheck is used in over 30 states."
212,"It crossreferences the names, birth dates, and the last four digits of 45 million registered voters' social security numbers."
213,Over seven million names have been flagged by the system.
214,"In 2016, Kobach's office rejected more ballots than Florida, whose population is seven times larger than Kansas."
215,What makes Crosscheck so dangerous is how inaccurate it is.
216,Researchers have found that it has a 99% error rate and a unique feature in the system allows it to single out people of color who predominantly don't vote Republican.
217," How it works is most of the states, many of the states don't bother with social security."
218,"They don't bother with date of birth, they don't bother with suffix, and they really don't quite bother with your middle name either."
219,They do some variation of your first name.
220,They really hone in on that last name.
221,But there's a problem with that.
222,Minorities are overrepresented in terms of common last names.
223,"In terms of common last names, minorities are at 85 of the top 100 most common names in the United States."
224,"For instance, if your last name is Washington, there's almost a 90% chance that you're African American."
225,"If your last name is Hernandez, there's over a 90% chance that you're Hispanic."
226,"If your last name is Lee, over a 90% chance that you're Asian."
227," There was a time that in my life that I didn't even entertain the thought of talkin' to white people, y'know."
228,They were just nonentities to me.
229,"If I had to interact with any, it was on a different level that I, they were over there and I was over here."
230,"And even when I was in the Army, right?"
231,That I had all these white officers.
232,"I worked, when I was in the Army, I worked for JAG, I was a Most of the officers that I worked for were white."
233,"And I generally liked some of them but then if one said somethin' that I didn't, that could be misconstrued as racist, my antenna would go up."
234,Forrest's memory has been tainted by the accusations started by a northern newspaper during the war that he had ordered the execution of black troops captured at Fort Pillow in Tennessee.
235,It was also rumored that he organized the Ku Klux Klan resistance to reconstruction after the war.
236,Several Congressional inquiries produced no credible evidence to support either accusation and no charges were ever brought against Forrest.
237,"Having accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and savior in 1875, he was called home October 29, 1877."
238,Okay.
239,"Okay, first of all, I don't think, see this is what I call that history that they tell their versions, y'know?"
240," Narrator After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery except as a form of punishment."
241,The master was replaced with a carceral state.
242,"Under the Black Codes, African Americans were arrested on the simplest of offenses."
243,"In 1868, Florida created a law to disenfranchise those with a felony conviction."
244,"By 1906, every state across the south banned felons from voting."
245, Felony disfranchisement has a long sordid history.
246,Let's talk about Alabama.
247,"Alabama and its Jim Crow Constitution of 1901 crafted a language in there that said if you have been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, you have lost your right to vote."
248,Alabama refused to define moral turpitude.
249,"And so, you have a conviction but you don't quite know if it's moral turpitude or not."
250,Are you going to risk voting and getting hit with another felony because you decided to vote?
251," Narrator In 2017, Alabama finally defined moral turpitude."
252,"But by that time, 15% of African American adults, or one out of every seven, could not vote because of felony disenfranchisement."
253,Over six million Americans can't vote because of felony convictions.
254,where an amendment to Florida's constitution was passed in 2018 to reverse this practice only to have the Republican dominated legislature act contrary to the will of the people and kept it from happening.
255, 40% of black adult men in Florida could not vote.
256,Over 20% of black adults in Florida could not vote.
257,"Now Florida would count the heads of all of those people when it came to the census, which would then lead to the number of representatives the state would have in Congress."
258,"But none of those heads have the right to vote, to be able to choose their representatives."
259,It was like the 3/5 clause all over again.
260,And let's be clear that what is driving this massive felony disfranchisement is the war on drugs.
261, I'm standin' on the last piece of the original cement where the march from Selma to Montgomery left from.
262,"Bloody Sunday, March 7th, 1965."
263,"And I been tryin' to fight to save it because I think it's important that this history was bad, so I have to find a way to connect the children to it without just pointing out here and say that that's where, y'know, that's where the march left from."
264,"Big deal, they just see another empty space, right?"
265,"But I bring the children here and I stand them here and I instruct them pick up a rock, then I make them hold it up in the air and say and then I identify at least three of 'em."
266,"Oh, that's John Lewis' rock, you do know how John Lewis is, right?"
267,"Sometimes they know, sometimes they don't."
268,Give me a teaching opportunity.
269,"Oh, John Lewis was a congressman, is a congressman now but I knew John Lewis 54 years ago when he stood on that same rock you're holdin'."
270,"He was the president of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee."
271,Look at you holdin' that history in your hand.
272,"You must be a history maker, too."
273,"When you feel like you can't do anything, go pick up that rock and hold it in your hand and take from it the strength of the ordinary people who stood on that same rock and made history that not only changed this little town, but America."
274,And then get up off your behinds and do somethin' about it.
275,Is that clear?
276,And they all answer yes ma'am.
277, Gerrymandering is as old as the nation itself.
278,But the way that it has basically come onto steroids in the 21st century is absolutely frightening.
279, Narrator Gerrymandering has always been about party and race.
280,"Every 10 years after the census, district maps are redrawn based on the number of representatives."
281,"In its simplest form, redistricting would work as follows."
282,Let's say you have 100 voters and you need to split them into 10 districts.
283,"If you split them up evenly, you would have 10 competitive districts that could go either way."
284,"However, what if you simply put all of your competitor's voters into one district and then split yours into the other nine?"
285,"Obviously, your opponent would win their one district but you would win the other nine and thus be able to make all the rules."
286,"In an ideal world, districts are drawn fairly."
287,But we don't live in an ideal world.
288,"President Benjamin Harrison called gerrymandering political robbery, and he was right."
289,"Both parties do it, that's nothing new."
290,"But in 2010, when Republicans gained control of the legislature in the governor's office in 26 states, everything changed."
291,"Aided by computerdriven software, gerrymandering went to a whole new level."
292,"Districts were now drawn down the block level, and even to the houses on the block."
293,Districts were drawn to pack and stack segments of the population in order to dilute their voting power and suppress voter turnout.
294,"Paul Weyrich with the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which helped craft voter suppression legislation, was blunt in his reasoning."
295,I don't want everyone to vote.
296,The Republican party's leverage in the election quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.
297,Texas is a minority majority state.
298,but they control 70% of the districts.
299,"And similar results are found in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Florida, all because of the some of the craziest gerrymandering ever."
300,"The Louisiana Second District, Texas 35th, Illinois Fourth, Florida Fifth, Maryland's Third, and North Carolina's infamous 12th District."
301,"In fact, of the 10 most egregious gerrymandered districts, North Carolina leads the pack with three."
302, I'm tired of people beating us down and tryin' to act like we're not the same just because my skin is dark and some of my other brothers and sisters may be white doesn't mean that God didn't make me too.
303,"And I don't think God made it a joke, okay?"
304,"And the sooner we realize that we all human beings, the better this world will be."
305, The studies are really clear on this.
306,"When you're white, generally what happens is that whites in white neighborhoods have to wait in line the least amount of time to vote."
307,"And so it looks like ah, you go in, you show an ID 'cause everybody has an ID, you go cast your ballots, you're in and out in what, five minutes, six minutes?"
308,"If you're a minority, however, again the studies are clear."
309,"If you're black and you're in a black neighborhood, you have the longest amount of time to wait to vote."
310,And that is because there are fewer machines that actually work that have been assigned to your precinct.
311,There are fewer poll workers.
312,"In short, there are fewer resources put into minority precincts."
313,"And so with fewer resources, the line just grows and grows and grows."
314,"And so here in Georgia, for instance, in our last election, the average wait was about three hours to vote."
315,"It looks like it's working, it looks like everybody has the same opportunity."
316,They don't and that is deliberate.
317, Narrator One of those tricks is the restrictions placed on polling stations themselves.
318,African American and Latino voters have traditionally been early voters.
319,"Legislators in places like Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, and Florida have reduced the availability of early voting."
320,do not have any early voting at all.
321,"In Ohio, the Secretary of State allowed for only one early polling station per county."
322,"That might work for the 6,000 people of Pickaway County, which is nearly 95% white."
323,"But in Hamilton County, home to the state's third largest city, the majority minority city of Cincinnati, one polling station for 800,000 people just isn't gonna cut it."
324,"In Indiana's 92 counties, only three have populations larger than 325,000 residents."
325,"live in two of the three counties, Marion and Lake."
326,"It probably comes as no surprise, then, that former governor Mike Pence and the Republicanled legislature decided that counties with a population over 325,000 were restricted to one polling station unless the bipartisan county election board unanimously voted to have more."
327,Smaller white counties have no such restrictions.
328,But closing early polling stations is just one way to restrict access to the vote.
329,"Moving the location is effective, as well."
330,North Carolina moved nearly 1/3 of those in predominantly black areas.
331,Studies have shown that voting by black voters drops .5% for every tenth of a mile the polling station is moved.
332,"It's estimated that 19,000 black voters were kept from voting using this method."
333, Joanne I need people to understand this.
334,This history happened.
335,And we can't go back and erase it.
336,But what came out of that history and where do we take it from there?
337,Sometimes I think I'm marchin' over that bridge again or definitely gonna have to march over there again to make a change.
338,"But we need each other, we're not goin' anywhere."
339,"We're not movin' forward when you try to hurt us, a whole segment of people."
340,"You're not movin' forward, you just think you are."
341,And it's gonna always be that unrest and that craziness you have to deal with when the power is not distributed properly.
342,"And that's what most movements are about, distribution of power."
343," One of the things that we began to understand in the movement, during the Civil Rights movement, was that as long as somebody was not free, none of us were free."
344,That hasn't changed.
345,That hasn't changed.
346,When we're talking about what is happening with voter suppression where we get representatives who are unrepresentative.
347,We get members in a democracy who are not responsible to that democracy.
348,None of us are free.
349," Narrator Of the one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, there were 31 reported incidents of voter fraud."
350,These included false claims by the loser.
351,The incident rate of voter fraud is between .0003% and .0025%.
352,"In 2016, there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud."
353,"In short, voter fraud is a false flag narrative designed to suppress and disenfranchise specific bodies of the electorate in order to maintain the status quo in a changing America."
354,Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes in 2016.
355,"Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin made him president."
356,"If Hillary won those three states, which Obama won in 2008 and But she didn't."
357,Voter suppression worked.
358,The most striking results are in Wisconsin where the voting rates of African Americans dropped to less than 50% in 2016 from 78% in 2012.
359,This decline was more than four times the national average.
360,Wisconsin is 92% white.
361,"There's 348,308 African American citizens make up just 6.1% of the population."
362,Nearly 70% of Wisconsin's black population lives in Milwaukee.
363,"In the 2016 election, in Milwaukee as a result of voter suppression."
364,"Donald J. Trump won Wisconsin by 22,748 votes."
365, Obama said yes we can.
366,And we saw what happened in that 2008 election.
367,"Today, we have to say yes we will."
368,It is upon us to stand up and fight for this democracy.
369,Yes we will.
370,It is that determination that had 11 year old Joanne Bland on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
371,This was a little girl well before she could be able to vote willing to put it on the line to be free.
372,That's a freedom fighter.
373,Yes we will.
374,"That's how we get the democracy we deserve, not the one that they're trying to foist upon us."
