1,They are close.
2,Koba!
3,"Now, father?"
4,"Son, stay..."
5,"Thank you, Koba."
6,"Think before you act, son."
7,"Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes..."
8,Scars make you strong.
9,Come meet your new brother.
10,Another son.
11,"Makes me think how far we've come, Maurice."
12,Seems long ago.
13,Still think about them?
14,Humans?
15,Sometimes.
16,Didn't know them like you did.
17,Only saw their bad side.
18,"Good, bad... doesn't matter now."
19,Humans destroyed each other.
20,Apes fight too.
21,But we are family.
22,Wonder if they're really all gone.
23,Ten winters now...
24,Last two... no sign of them.
25,They must be gone.
26,That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!
27,"Shut up, Ash!"
28,They shot Ash! Shot my son!
29,"Rocket, wait..."
30,Go!
31,Go!
32,Koba!
33,Follow!
34,Must attack them now!
35,Before they attack us!
36,We don't know how many there are.
37,How many guns they have?
38,Or why they came up here?
39,"They shot your son, Rocket!"
40,Don't you want to fight?
41,I follow Caesar.
42,Koba's right!
43,"They almost killed you, Ash!"
44,No!
45,If we go to war...
46,We could lose all we've built...
47,Home.
48,Family.
49,Future.
50,I will decide by morning.
51,Caesar.
52,For years I was a prisoner in their lab...
53,They cut me... Tortured me.
54,You freed me.
55,I would do anything you ask.
56,But we must show strength!
57,"We will, Koba."
58, Human lies!
59, No! No!
60,Show me.
61,The... lights.
62,You brought others?
63,Come on!
64,"If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!"
65,Why help them?!
66,They seem desperate...
67,"If we make them go, they'll attack."
68,Let them.
69,We'll destroy them while they're weak.
70,And how many apes will die?
71,We have one chance for peace...
72,Let them do their human work.
73,Then they'll go.
74,Human work?
75,Human work.
76,Human work.
77,Human work!
78,Koba say...
79,Apes should hate humans...
80,Enough!
81,From humans Koba learned hate...
82,But nothing else.
83,You sound sick... You ok?
84,Just need rest.
85,You worry about the humans...
86,Where's Koba?
87,Still angry.
88,Said he was going hunting...
89,"Look, humans below!"
90,Why are we here?
91,Caesar trusts humans...
92,Koba does not.
93,Enough guns here to kill every ape...
94,Must warn Caesar.
95,Who knows what humans are really doing up there?
96,Said no guns!
97,Human leave now!
98,This my home.
99, You should not be here.
100,Do not trust you.
101,One day.
102,You stay one day.
103, One day!
104,Ape will help.
105,I will not help!
106,Just came from the city.
107,Humans very dangerous!
108,Where is Caesar?
109,With the humans...
110,Caesar.
111,Hey!
112,"No! No, no, no, don't! No! No! No!"
113,Where Caesar? Want Caesar.
114,Caesar!
115,Humans attack your sons.
116,You let them stay!
117,Put apes in danger!
118,Caesar love humans more...
119,than apes!
120,More than your...
121,sons.
122,Ape...
123,not...
124,kill... ape.
125,Forgive me.
126,You are my son...
127,I need you to listen...
128,You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?
129,Neither will you.
130,Your father doesn't trust me now.
131,You need to protect him.
132,His love for humans...
133,Makes him blind.
134,I know...
135,As long as they are here...
136,I fear for Caesar's life.
137,For yesterday.
138,Look. Look.
139,Watch. Watch.
140,"""It was Friday."
141,"""A real nice afternoon."
142,"""Warm."
143,"""We were hanging... hanging..."
144,"""We were hanging out..."
145,"""at this kegger down at the swimming hole."" Hanging out."
146,Hanging.

196,No.
197,Not human.
198,Koba.
199,Son.
200,I'm so sorry... For everything.
201,No.
202,I...
203,am to blame.
204,But Koba betrayed you.
205,I...
206,chose to trust him...
207,because he is ape.
208,I always think...
209,ape better than human.
210,I see now...
211,how much like them we are.
212,Where Koba now?
213,On the human tower...
214,Loyal apes around him.
215,And those who not follow?
216,Prisoners.
217,Maurice. Rocket.
218,Koba killed Ash.
219,Fear makes others follow.
220,But when they see you alive...
221,They will turn from Koba.
222,Not if I am weak.
223,Ape always seek strongest branch.
224,I must do something to stop him.
225,Father.
226,Let me help you.
227,"Okay. Caesar, look."
228,Apple. Apple.
229,Good.

239,They're on their way.
240,Mother too.
241,Must go. Now!
242,Thank you.
243,"All right, I'm coming out!"
244,Don't shoot!
245,Caesar has no place here.
246,Apes follow Koba now.
247,Follow Koba to war.
248,Apes win war!
249,Apes together strong!
250,Caesar weak.
251,Koba weaker.
252,Trusted Koba like brother.
253,Caesar brother to human!
254,Koba fight for ape!
255,Free ape!
256,Kill ape. Koba fight for Koba.
