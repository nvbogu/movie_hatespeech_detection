32,It's a weighty responsibility.

57, Do her. Do her.
58, I'm just saying.
59,Oh? Mmm.
60,"""Watching Dee Dee Allen's Eleanor Roosevelt croaking out a heavyhanded message of activism is like paying an aging drag queen to shove a syrupsoaked American flag down my throat."" Well, thatâ¦ That's not criticism."

62,"""If you're considering buying a ticket to this show, do yourself a favor."" ""Buy a few feet of good, heavy rope instead and then go hang yourself."" Oh, God! Oh, God!"
63,What?

65,It's not the show. It's you two.
66,You're just not likeable.
67, What?
68, What?
69,Nobody likes a narcissist.
70," Oh, thisâ¦  Oh, that."

87, Trent.
88,Why are you dressed like a waiter?
89, I'm in between gigs at the moment.
90, Hmm.
91,"Honestly, Dee Dee, I feel adrift as I did in my days before Juilliard."
92,"Oh, my God."
93,"You see, my passions are fueled by the power of Lady Theater and how she can, with a gentle touch of her hand, sculpt a human soul."
94," But we learned at Juilliardâ¦  Oh, mother of God."
95,"If I could soliloquize, ""If you prick me, do I not bleed?"" ""And if you do not pay me, do I not still act?"" That might be enough."
96,"Still, I have played Hamlet, and yet I'm only known as that guy from the beloved early aughts' sitcomâ¦ Talk to the Hand."

122,We'reâ¦ We're still celebrities.
123,We still have power.
124,"Now, The Times sort of castrated you as it were."
125,Yep. They wrote you off as aging narcissists.
126,I still don't understand what's wrong with that.
127,"There's a very simple way that we can still love ourselves yet appear to be decent human beings, okay?"
128,We will become celebrity activists.
129, Oh! Brilliant!
130, Right?
131, All we need is a cause.

153, Are they allowed to do that?
154, No.
155,"Principal Hawkins, your response."
156,The first thing I'm going to do is contact the Indiana state's attorney.
157,This is not about school rules.
158,This is a civil rights case.
159,"Wait, seriously?"
160,I'm betting pressure from the state's attorney will stop these bigots cold.
161,It better.
162,Because I'll tell you this much.
163,"If word gets out, people are gonna get mad."
164,This pisses me off.
165,"The next thing you know, some modernday Eleanor Roosevelt is gonna march down here and all hell's gonna break loose."
166,We have got to go down there and raise holy hell.

190,Do you like the bears?
191,"Yeah, you know, I'm pretty sure this breaks a few laws."
192," It's our way of saying thank you, Emma."
193, Yeah. Thanks for canceling prom.
194,I didn't cancel prom. Your parents did.
195,Come on. Lay off her.
196," Oh, are you on her side now?"
197, No.
198,I'm just not in third grade.
199,See you at practice.
200,"Unlike your social life, this isn't over."
201,"âª Note to self âª âª Don't be gay in Indiana âª âª Big headsup That's a really stupid plan âª âª There are places Where it's in to be out âª âª Maybe San Francisco or thereabout âª âª But in Indiana, without a doubt âª âª If you're not straight Then guess what's bound to hit the fan? âª âª Just breathe, Emma âª âª Not everyone is that repressed âª âª Just breathe, Emma âª âª It wouldn't be high school Without a test âª âª Just close your eyes and count to ten âª âª Go to your happy place âª âª And then try not to combust âª âª Just breathe âª Hey, Emma.

204, Like an exchange student?
205, Maybe.
206, Mmm.

211,"This is a big deal, Emma."
212,"So, what are you saying?"
213,I'm just saying I'm really excited to be a part of something like this.
214,We'll see how the PTA meeting goes.

234,This is gonna get me my third Tony Award.
235," Oh, my God."
236, What?
237,"Oh, come on, you know how political the Tonys are."
238,They don't vote for you.
239,They vote for your brand.
240,My brand is a little tarnished at the moment.
241,'Cause of the infamous tirade at the Longacre Theatre?
242,When a cell phone goes off in the middle of a performanceâ¦  I can't be held responsible.
243, It was your cell phone!
244, I didn't know that!
245, It was in your wig!
246,"I didn't know that at the time. Anywayâ¦ All the goodwill that we're gonna get from this thing will wash me clean, and I will win, no matter what my next project is."
247,You're just greedy.
248,I'd be happy with one Tony.
249, I thought I had a shot with FDR.
250, Mmmhmm.
251,I need a win.
252,I'm so sick of all the rejection.
253,I'm no Dee Dee Allen.
254, A lot of bile.
255," Well, I'm angry at life."
256,"No, I mean Trent. He's retching again."
257,"You were saying something about yourâ¦ I got into this business, yes, because I loved it, but also to prove to everyone who doubted me, myâ¦ teachers, the kids on the school bus, my horrible parents, that I could do something."
258,Something important.

264,"No, the state's attorney wants us to hold an inclusive prom."
265,Yes.
266,Because that's what they feel best reflects America's values.
267,"Well, this isn't America. This is Indiana."
268,All right.
269,"Just to be clear, this is America and everyone gets to have an opinion..."
270,"Oh, just like you."
271,My son will not be forced to go to a homosexual prom.
272,"Thank you, Beverly! Thank you!"
273,"Again, it is not a homosexual prom."
274,It is an inclusive promâ¦  With homosexuals.
275, You don't have to attend...
276,You don't have to attend if you don't want to.
277,"Lookâ¦ Iâ¦ I'm sorry you're upset, but the organization of the prom is within the purview of the student council."

279,Uhâ¦ Okay.
280,"Well, we want prom to go on, obviously."
281,It's supposed to be a celebration of all students...
282,"Okay. No, thank you. It's fine, everyone."
283,"Sweetheart, I'm so sorry, but this is not a student matter."
284,This is about governmentâ¦ tearing our community apart.
285,It's about big government taking away our freedom of choice.
286,Okay. Okay.
287,This is not about government intervention.
288,"Emma, what is this about?"
289,I just want to go to prom like any other kid.
290,Mmmhmm. But you can't.
291,"She can't, and that's why the courts are involved."
292,Ask yourself.
293,What exactly is it that you find so frightening about gay people?
294,Hold it! Stop! Stop!
295,Hold it!
296,What you are doing here is wrong.
297,I'm sorry. Who are you?

355,That song made me a star.
356,It made me a fan.
357," Uh, Dee Dee, we gotta make haste."
358, Okay.
359,"Uh, Miss Allen, I justâ¦ This is a very delicate situation."
360,I'm asking you and your friends to back off for a few days.
361, Back off?
362, Yeah.
363,Backing off is exactly what we're not going to do.
364,I see what's happening here.
365,You're trying to disarm me with flattery.
366,"It's not going to work, Tom."
367,Flattery makes me stronger.
368,Fuels my ego.
369, That was insane.
370, I know.
371, I'm really freaking out.
372, Don't freak out.
373,"We have a plan, remember?"
374,"We're gonna get dressed up and go to prom and be together in public, not hide anymore."
375,Are you sure about this?
376,There's only one thing I'm sure about.
377,âª I don't want to start a riot âª âª I don't want to blaze a trail âª âª I don't want to be a symbol âª âª Or a cautionary tale âª âª I don't want to be a scapegoat âª âª For people to oppose âª âª What I want is simple âª âª As far as wanting goes âª âª I just want to dance with you âª âª Let the whole world melt away âª âª And dance with you âª âª Who cares what other people say? âª âª And when we're through âª âª No one can convince us âª âª We were wrong âª âª All it takes is you and me âª âª And a song âª âª I don't need a big production âª âª Streamers hanging in the air âª âª I don't need to spend the night with âª âª Confetti in my hair âª âª I don't need a room of people âª âª That I don't really know âª âª I just want to hold you âª âª And never let you go! âª âª I just want to dance with you âª âª Let the whole world melt away âª âª And dance with you âª âª Who cares what other people say? âª âª And when we're throughâ¦ âª âª No one can convince us âª âª We were wrong âª âª All it takes is you and me âª âª And a song âª It's my mom. I gotta go.
378,Okay.
379,"Byeâ¦ âª All it takes is you and me âª âª Andâ¦ âª âª A song âª Oh, God."
380,It's worse than the bus.
381,At least it's quieter. Huh?
382,I need a drink.
383,Hello?
384,"Oh. Dickinson, four rooms."
385,I called yesterday.
386,"Four rooms of varying size to reflect the hierarchy of the company, right?"
387,Where is my suite?
388,We don't have a suite.
389, Now do you have a suite?
390, Oh!
391,"No, we don't have any suites."
392,All the rooms are the same.
393,Oh!
394,Surely you know who I am.
395,"At the very least, I would like a room next to the spa."
396,"Uh, there's no spa."
397,"Angie, what is this place?"
398,We're all gonna get stabbed and stuffed.
399," You know that, right?"
400, Orbitz gave it three stars!
401,Do you have any cabins?
402,"No, we don't have any cabins."
403, How about now?
404, What is that?
405,It's a Drama Desk. You know what it is.
406, I vomited in the bus again.
407, Mmm.
408,"Can I see the hotel doctor, please?"
409,"Oh, my God, it's you."
410,I can't believe it. It's actually you.
411,You're the guy from Talk to the Hand.
412,It's on every night at 9:00 after...
413," Can I have my room, please?"
414," Okay, let's get started. All right?"
415, Let's change some minds.
416, Uhâ¦  Thank you.
417, You're welcome.
418,Oh! A wishing well!
419,"Make a wish, Dee Dee."
420,Death. I wish for death.
421,"Okay, Sheldon's working on a venue."
422,"Now, how's the song?"
423,"Uh, about that."
424,I was misled by my representation.
425,Mr. Sondheim is not a fan of my Sweeney Todd.
426," Quite the opposite, actually."
427," Oh, my Godâ¦ Jesus, Trent, you screwed us."
428,Don't worry.
429,I wrote something myself. Yeah.
430,"It's quite rousing, and in a very humane key."
431,"The Godspell kids will back us up, and they have their own costumes."
432,You're welcome.
433," Oh, my God."
434, Yeah!
435,This is awful.
436,We can't perform this.
437,They'll boo us off the stage.
438,"No, all we need is a simple message that tugs at the heartstrings and a little pageantry."
439, We have everything we need right here.
440, Except a venue.
441,O ye of little faith.
442,I got one!
443,"And a crowd of 2,500 guaranteed."
444, What?
445, That's amazing!
446,What is it? One of those beautiful Antebellum theaters?
447,"No, it's, uhâ¦ an arena."
448,An arena?
449,So it's come to this.
450,"Ladies and gentlemen, Truckosaurus, the careating robot dinosaur, will not be your halftime entertainment today."
451,"Instead, we have some guests who've come from New York to sing us a song about intolerance."
452,Hi there.
453,"I'm Trent Oliver, actor, activistâ¦ and Juilliard graduate."
454,"Emma, this one's for you."
455,"âª Flowers accept the rain And grow more beautiful âª âª Babies accept their mother's breast âª âª So they can grow strong âª âª I accept that I was born A handsome man âª âª So join with me And sing this acceptance song âª âª Let us accept one another âª âª I know it's truly hard âª âª We're sister and brother âª âª Here's what I learned at Juilliard âª âª Bigotry's not big of me âª âª And it's not big of you âª âª Let's all work together âª âª To make rainbow dreams come true âª Ladies and gentlemen, twotime Tony Award winner, Miss Dee Dee Allen."
456," Trent, I could rip your face off."
457, I'm sorry.
458,You made me fail.
459,I am so sick of failing.
460,What do we do now?
461,We leave.
462," First we kill Trent, then we leave."
463, What about the girl?
464,"Hello, everyoneâ¦ We have some news. Emma and I wanted to be the ones to tell you, thanks to pressure from the state's attorney's office, prom is back on!"
465, What?
466, Prom is back on!
467,We did it!
468,Yay!
469,See? We're not narcissists.
470,"Just to be clear, uh, it's not because of youâ¦ Well, maybe it was."
471,"I mean, everybody started freaking out when you got here."
472,"The lawyer might've had legal power, but you really scared people."
473, Aw!
474, We scared people!
475,"Important thing is, it's a victory."
476,Now you get to go to prom like everybody else!
477, Yes!
478, What are you gonna wear?
479,I was thinking like a vintage tux and some high tops.
480,I don't know. Does it matter?
481,"Does itâ¦  Honeyâ¦  Sweetheart, booboo."
482,"I don't know you, okay?"
483,"And you don't know me, but I am begging you, let me dress you for the prom."
484, Okay? Yeah?
485, Okay.
486,We're going to Saks.
487," Uh, there's no Saks here."
488, We have a Kmart!
489, A what?
490, A Kmart.
491,Fine.
492,"We'll check out the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart, do a little fashion show."
493,"Okay! Oh, can we do it tomorrow?"
494,We can meet at my place.
495,I have to go and find out if I still have a date.
496,"Sure. I'll go ahead, do a preshop."
497,Okay? Will you give me a ride in your pickup truck?
498,"Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian, I drive a pickup?"
499," Well, do you?"
500, Shut up.
501, Anybody hungry?
502, I could drink.
503, What's around here?
504, I saw a Big Boy by the highway.
505," Ooh, they have a gay bar here?"
506, I love Big Boy.
507,"Oh, gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed."
508,Oh! Of course.
509," So, it's nice to see Emma smile again."
510, Yes.
511,She's had a rough go of it.
512,I gathered that. Yeah.
513, Even before the prom controversy.
514, Oh?
515,"When she came out, her parents, well, they threw her out of the house."
516, Really?
517, Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.
518," It was, uh, pretty ugly."
519," Ohâ¦ Anyway, umâ¦ thank you for helping herâ¦ Or trying to."
520,"Yeahâ¦  Uh, Tom?"
521," Yes, yeah?"
522,"Is there a restaurant in town that has plates and cutlery andâ¦ Oh, uh, there's an Applebee's by the mall."
523, Would you like to go?
524, Yes.
525,Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.
526,All right.
527, Thank you.
528, You're welcome.
529,How nice of you.
530, Guess what today is?
531, What?
532,Promposal day!
533,"Hey, Kaylee!"
534,"âª Since JV football, I've been adored âª âª Big man on campus but ohsobored âª âª My life was perfect âª âª But so routine âª âª I prayed for someone to intervene âª âª Then something new happened âª âª And turned my life around entirely âª âª And that's 'cause you happened âª âª And look what happened to me âª âª So go to prom with me, Kaylee! âª  You're such an idiot. Yes!"
535, Whoo!
536,"Hey, Shelby, you're next."
537,"âª There's not one subject That I could pass âª âª Before you walked into My Spanish class âª âª Was my heart pounding? âª âª I won't say no âª âª 'Cause life without you was no bueno âª âª Then something new happened âª âª And turned my life around entirely âª âª And that's 'cause you happened âª âª And look what happened to me âª âª So go to prom with me, Shelby! âª SÃ­! SÃ­, seÃ±or!"
538,You did it.
539,"No, you actually did it."
540,We have a prom because of you.
541,It's like a love bomb went off.
542,I've seen six promposals today.
543,People are gonna see us dancing together and kissing.
544,It's gonna be impossible not to kiss you.
545,"Oh, my God, and you know, what's my mom going to think?"
546,"I mean, she'll be in public, so she can't totally freak out."
547,It doesn't matter what she does.
548,This is about us.
549,This is about us finally being us.
550,âª And no more hiding how we feel anymore âª âª I won't hide if you're by my side âª âª Now that the prom is back âª âª On track âª âª And once we walk into that gym âª âª Handinhand âª âª It's pretty obvious âª âª There's no going back âª âª And that's a promise âª I save all of my money.
551,I go to New York every summer.
552, I see as many Broadway shows as I can.
553, Oh.
554,"When I run out of money, I second act them."
555, Oh.
556, Don't tell anybody.
557,Bad!
558,"My point is, I've seen you many, many times."
559,Oh.
560,Mr. Hawkins.
561,Mrs. Greene.
562,Hello. I'm Dee Dee Allen.
563, We haven't officially met.
564, No.
565, Hello. Dee Dee Allen.
566, We're aware.
567,"Ms. Allen, I'm sure that you are very wellversed in the ways of the world and Broadway in particular."
568,That's a community.
569,But you don't know us.
570,You don't know this town and our values.
571,"No, well, I'm just here advocating on behalf of a young girl whose voice perhaps is not heard by some in the community."
572,"Yes. Well, perhaps you should stick to acting instead of activism."
573,Enjoy your meal.
574,We didn't mean to make anything worse here.
575,I appreciate everything that you're doing.
576,"Well, let's just drop it."
577,Yeah.
578,Tell meâ¦ I've never said this before to anyone.
579,Tell me about you.
580, About me?
581, Yeah.
582,I don't know.
583,I'm just a smalltown principal.
584,"Uh, you know, it can be frustrating, but, uh, at least I have a job."
585,"Yeah, lucky you."
586,Single.
587,Sorry?
588,I'm single. Just putting that out there.
589,Really?
590,I'm surprised.
591,"Oh, well, I'm surprised you're surprised."
592,The two things I'm most passionate about in the world are Broadway musicals and secondary school administration.
593,Oh.
594,"I typed that into a dating website once, and a little message popped up that said, ""You will have zero matches forever."" But you're so smart and you're really goodlooking."
595,"Well, if Iâ¦ Thank you."
596,"It's just, I look at people like you, and I just think how lucky you are to be surrounded by your people."
597,My wh... My people?
598,I wasn't born on Broadway. You know?
599,"I'm from Zelienople, Pennsylvania."
600,"Yeah, I grew up dirt poor."
601,"This wholeâ¦ All this, I invented it."
602,Yeah. I'm just a smalltown girl andâ¦  I had a big dream.
603, Hmm.
604,"Single, just putting it out there."
605,"Well, I'm divorced."
606,"Oh, I think I read about that."
607,"Eddie Sharpe, the talk show host?"
608,"Yeah, right."
609,It lasted 15 heartpulverizing years.
610,"I imagine it must be hard being Dee Dee Allen, being a Broadway star."
611,"You know, it is hard."
612,Sometimes I think I reallyâ¦ I just want to quit.
613,"No. No, please, you can't..."
614,You can't do that.
615,Why not?
616,Because I need you to do what you do.
617,"âª My days have little glamour âª âª Writing memos, making calls âª âª And wincing at the grammar Written on the bathroom walls âª âª It's all school supplies And budget size âª âª And wading through red tape âª âª That's why I love the theater âª âª It's how I escape âª So, theater's a distraction."
618,Is that what you mean?
619,A distraction is momentary.
620,An escape helps you heal.
621,"âª We look to you âª âª To take us away âª âª From the soulcrushing jobs âª âª And emasculating pay âª âª When our lives come up short âª âª And our hopes are sad and few âª âª You whisk us off To someplace strange and new âª âª We look to you âª âª In good times and bad âª âª The worlds you create Make the real one seem less sad âª âª The curtain goes up âª âª And every now and then âª âª It feels as if we're coming home again âª âª Yes, coming home again âª âª We need a place to run to âª âª When everything goes wrong âª âª Where the answer to each problem Is to burst into a song âª âª And standard rules of logic âª âª Just simply don't apply âª âª When people dance in unison âª âª And no one wonders why âª You make it sound so beautiful."
622,âª We look to you âª âª As strange as it seems âª âª When reality goes âª âª To scary new extremes âª âª So don't ever give up âª âª And this I guarantee âª âª Next time you think no one cares âª âª You can look âª âª To me âª  That's a nice picture.
623," Oh, it's terrible."
624,Look at the backdrop.
625,"Clouds? What, are we flying?"
626,It's sweet.
627,"Wellâ¦ you know, she needed proof she was still part of the family, and nothing says family like a Sears family portrait."
628, Is there booze in this?
629, There sure is.
630," When you said lemonadeâ¦  Well, it's Indiana lemonade."
631,"Okay, it's official. I love you."
632,You're the cool grandmother I never had.
633,"Hey, let me ask you something."
634,What happened with Emma?
635,"You're not a mother, so you can't know what it's like to see your own daughter give up her child."
636,I'm sorry.
637,"When Emma came out, oh, they could not handle it."
638,To bad parents and their broken progeny.
639,Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid.
640,Mmm.
641,"Oh, I wasn't talking about her."
642,What? You got kicked out too?
643,"Well, I left before they could do that."
644,So the only nice dress I have is this.
645,Wow.
646,"Okay, I mean, yeah, yep, you could wear that to prom or keep it lying around in case there's a remake of Little House on the Prairie."
647,Okay. That's it. I like him.
648,"Emma, please let me dress you for this prom."
649,I don't know. This is all so crazy.
650,What did you wear to your prom?
651,"Well, I was going to wear a silver tux, aqua accessories, the whole look."
652,"I waited outside, anxious to see my crush, but when I saw him with his date, I froze."
653,I couldn't go in.
654,I didn't have your courage.
655,This isn't about me.
656,This is about you.
657,And I promise you are going to have the night of your life.
658,What is your date wearing?
659,I don't know.
660,I've never been to her house before.
661,Her mom doesn't know about us.
662,How long have you been together?
663, A year and a half.
664," Oh, honey."
665,"But she's coming out tonight, big time."
666,That's the plan.
667,I'm really scared.
668,Would you get over here?
669,The point is you are brave.
670,You made all this happen.
671,"When you walk into that gym tonight, you know what people are gonna see?"
672,They're going to see the bravest person on the planet.
673,This is so hard.
674,Does every girl go through this?
675,"Yes, all across town, girls are spraying on their tans and whitening their teeth, trying to look their best for the prom, but they're wasting their time because they don't have the glow that you have right now."
676,"I trust you completely, and that's kind of scary too."
677,Can we please go shop? Can we mall it?
678, Is that okay?
679," Yes, mall the hell out of it!"
680, Let's go.
681, Okay!
682,But get changed. This is disgusting.
683,âª I can tell you're feeling wary âª âª But you can count on Uncle Barry âª âª He can turn this butchy duck Into a swan âª âª Your whole look could use a shakeup âª âª You can borrow all my makeup âª âª And the pair of Spanx I currently have on âª I think I'll pass.
684,"âª Treat the whole world like your runway âª âª Make it fierce, but in a fun way âª âª Try to flip your hair like Cher And drag queens do âª âª And I don't mean to be rude, dear âª âª But you could use some attitude, dear âª âª Let's show the school That tonight belongs âª âª To you âª âª One thing's universal âª âª Life's no dress rehearsal âª âª So why not make some waves Before it's through? âª âª Go big or you've blown it âª âª It's time that you own it âª âª Let's make it clear That tonight belongs to you âª It fits!"
685,"Now, whatever we choose, you've gotta remember to sell it."
686,How do I do that?
687,Allow Miss Glickman to demonstrate.
688,"âª You might find this disconcerting âª âª But ole Barry's done some flirting âª âª Try to bat your eyes Smize each time you grin âª âª I can guess your whole agenda âª âª You be Elphie, I'm Galinda âª âª It's makeover time So why not just give in? âª Come on!"
689,"âª One thing's universal âª âª Life's no dress rehearsal âª âª So why not make some waves Before it's through? âª âª Go big or you've blown it âª âª It's time that I own it! âª Yes, ma'am!"
690,âª Let's make it clear That tonight belongs to you âª What?
691,"âª Belongs to me! âª Oh, God, I can't believe this is finally happening."
692,I know.
693,She almost ruined it for all of us.
694,"Well, what goes around comes around."
695, You look hot.
696, You look so hot.
697,"âª Well, I hate to sound conceited âª âª But the boys get overheated âª âª When I strike a pose or two like thus âª âª And you have to hand it to me âª âª I mean, even I would do me âª âª Let's show the world tonight belongs âª âª To us âª âª One thing's universal âª âª Life's no dress rehearsal âª âª Excuse me while I state the obvious âª âª Go big or you've blown it âª âª It's time that we own it âª âª And make it clear That tonight belongs to us âª Alyssa, you look so beautiful."
698,You should always wear your hair like this.
699, Mom.
700, Yeah?
701,I just want you to know what's gonna happen tonight.
702,"No. Can we not spoil this, please?"
703,I have worked so hard for tonight.
704,I have a right to enjoy it too.
705,You are going to have a wonderful prom like a normal girl.
706, I've made sure of that.
707, What is that supposed to mean?
708,"âª I don't like When strangers get in my way âª âª Or anyone who messes with the PTA âª âª Well, maybe that's just me âª âª But trust me Fixing little problems is what I do âª âª Now everyone is happy I promise you âª âª And I would never Miss a night like this âª âª Alyssa âª âª You're my superstar âª âª Now get your ass in the car âª âª One thing's universal âª âª Life's no dress rehearsal âª âª Excuse me while I state the obvious âª âª Go big or you've blown it âª âª It's time that we own it âª âª And make it clear That tonight belongs to âª âª Make it clear that tonight belongs to âª âª Make it clear that tonight belongs âª Wait there."
709,I'll get the door. Okay? Okay.
710, Are you ready?
711, We're ready. We can't wait.
712," Here, hold this. I wanna get the picture."
713, Okay. here we go.
714, Wow.
715," Oh, my God!"
716,Look at you!
717,You look amazing!
718,Are you sure it's not too girly?
719,"Aw. No, it's just the right amount of girly."
720, You did well.
721, Right?
722,"Hey, where's your date?"
723,We're meeting in the gym.
724,She's still a little shy about all this.
725,"Well, this is where we leave you."
726,Our work here is done.
727,You go. You have the time of your life.
728,Can you walk me in? I'm a little nervous.
729,"Of course. Hey, hold on tight."
730, Ready?
731, Yep.
732, Clutch in this hand.
733," Oh, sorry!"
734,Aw.
735,Come on.
736, Who wants punch?
737, Only if it's spiked.
738,The walk away. The cute little truck.
739, We're doin' it!
740, Go ahead.
741,What's going on?
742,I'm putting the pieces together.
743,Gimme a sec.
744, What is happening?
745, Where is everybody?
746,Something is really wrong.
747,The whole parking lot is completely empty.
748,God. What's the theme of this prom? Death row?
749,"Mr. Hawkins, where are all the kids?"
750,I don't understand.
751,"Mom, what's happening?"
752,Why aren't we at the gym?
753,"At the last minute, there was a problem, so we had to change venues."
754,"No, Mom, what's going on?"
755,The courts told the PTA they had to hold an inclusive prom.
756,Don't worry. It's fine.
757,We did what we were required to do.
758,There was some resistance.
759,"So the parents met without my knowledge, and they've organized two proms."
760,One for the kids at the Elks Lodge in town.
761,And this one just for you.
762, We gave her a prom.
763, You did what?
764,"Wait, no, no."
765,I got texts from kids at school.
766,Everybody said it was here.
767,And they were lying to you.
768,It was part of the plan.
769, You lied to me.
770," Oh, yeah? Who's the liar?"
771,"We know about you and Emma, and trust me, we're doing you a favor."
772,No.
773," Oh, my God. This is so cruel."
774, I'm gonna cry.
775,"Okay, honey. Look at me."
776, Angie.
777, Yeah.
778, I want to go home.
779, I know you do.
780, This isn't happening.
781," And you got us, and this is awful."
782," No, no."
783, Honey.
784,"âª One thing's universal âª âª Life's no dress rehearsal âª âª When people find A scapegoat to condemn âª âª We went big, yet we've blown it âª âª Well, I guess I should have known it âª âª All along tonight âª âª Belonged âª âª To them âª  Alyssa?"
785, I swear I had no idea.
786,How could you not know?
787,You were on the prom committee.
788,It was Shelby and Kaylee.
789,They figured out we were together and they made sure I didn't find out.
790, They didn't want me to tell you.
791, Then come meet me.
792,I can't.
793,"Look, my mother's here."
794,"Well, leave her."
795,Tell her you're gay!
796,Tell her we're in love.
797,"That was the plan, wasn't it?"
798,I'm really sorry.
799,Have fun at the normal person's prom.
800,Wait. Emma.
801,Emma!
802,Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
803,"We are going to that prom, okay?"
804,They can't stop us.
805,We will march into that room...
806,"No! No, enough."
807,This is already the worst night of my life.
808,"Please, just stop helping me."
809,Emma! Emma!
810,This is a complete disaster.
811,This is a PR problem.
812,"No, Sheldon."
813,We had a PR problem back in New York.
814,This was supposed to solve that.
815,But thisâ¦ This is heartbreaking.
816,This is why you came here? For publicity?
817,I have been asked to read a statement.
818,"""What happened here was not the result of some elaborate plan to humiliate this girl, as has been reported in the press."" ""The James Madison High School ParentTeacher Association felt Emma would not be safe if we allowed her to attend prom with the other students because the uncomfortable truth is there are people in our community who are offended by her life choices."" I can't even wrap my head around this."
819,"It's a nightmare. Oh, my God!"
820,I wanna be the cockeyed optimist here 'cause I played Nellie Forbush in South Pacific.
821,"It was a dinner theater production, butâ¦ Ugh."
822,This is horrible. It really is.
823,Thanks for hanging out with me these past couple of days.
824,You've been a good friend.
825, I have?
826, You have. You seem surprised.
827,"No, I justâ¦ I'm a chorus girl. You know, I justâ¦ No one ever thanks me."
828,They don't even see me.
829,"Spend my whole life trying to stay in the game, and keep my daydrinking under control."
830,"That's really nice. Thanks, kid."
831,"Hey, you're going to get through this."
832,I know it.
833,"I thought that when my parents rejected me and stopped loving me that I would never feel any worse, you know?"
834,Mmmhmm.
835,And now thisâ¦ And I feel worse.
836, Honeyâ¦  I've never felt so alone in my life.
837,But you're not alone. You're not.
838,You got me. Hmm?
839,"And we are rideordie, and you do have friends."
840,Where are they?
841, This is it.
842, Yes.
843, No.
844," Well, okay."
845," Emma, can we come in?"
846, Yes.
847, We brought HÃ¤agenDazs.
848, That's fancy ice cream.
849,I know what HÃ¤agenDazs is. Hand it over.
850,"Emma, I know you said you didn't want us to help anymore, but we cannot let them get away with this."
851,We have got to fight back.
852,"Okay, I know everybody's really angry."
853,But I think we have to admit that we have made things worse.
854,I think the best thing we can do is disinfect our things and go back home.
855," No, we are not leaving."
856, No!
857,"Dee Dee, we are gonna stay here, and we're going to turn this thing around."
858, We gotta take back the press.
859," Yes, how?"
860,"Emma, you've got to step up and be the face of this thing."
861,And that's going to get her a prom?
862,This is not about a prom anymore.
863,This is about right and wrong.
864,"We need a national audience, prime time."
865,You want a big audience fast?
866,We gotta use our ace in the hole.
867, One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need.
868, No. No.
869, Dee Dee!
870, He's right.
871,"If I ask him for something, he will want something in return, and what he will want is the Hamptons house."
872,He's been trying to get it for years.
873,"Okay. Okay, fine. Look, Sheldon, you got to get that girl on TV."
874, Okay.
875, Great.
876,"No, not great."
877,"I'm sorry, but there is no way I'm getting in front of a camera and telling my story to millions of people. I can't do that."
878, See?
879," Please. Please, just go."
880," Emma, if you do nothing... Okay."
881, Barry. Go.
882," Okay, I get it. Okay. Okay."
883," Go. Go, go, go. Go, go."
884,I got this.
885,I know what I'm doing.
886,Let me do my thing.
887,"There must be a way to rid this community, and by extension, the nation, of this cancer of intolerance."
888,What are you even doing here?
889,What happened to Godspell?
890,"Indianapolis was canceled, as was the naval base at GuantÃ¡namo Bay."
891,What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this.
892,"Venture forth and seek out the young people and rap, in a nonmusical sense."
893,Mmm.
894,"Let's go get some more, huh?"
895,Two spoons this time.
896,Come on.
897,Gotta stop.
898,"Before you lecture me or kick me to death with those crazy antelope legs of yours, or whatever you're gonna do, I know I should do something."
899,I just can't.
900,You gotta do this.
901,"You gotta do it for all of us people that are standing in the wings, waiting to go on."
902, I'm too scared.
903, Hmm.
904,Let me tell you a story.
905,"It's 1975 and the original company of Chicago is in previews, and the worst flu in history hits the cast."
906,"They're down to the third cover for the role of Roxie Hart and she's scared, just like you are."
907,"And Fosse, who is a real ballbuster, is putting her through her paces and she's petrified."
908,"Worst of all, she's doing the routine like she's a robot."
909,"So the Foss, he says, ""Hey, kid. Snap out of it."" ""You got the steps."" ""You've got the notes."" ""Where's the zazz, baby?"" And even though she'd never heard that word before, she knew immediately what it meant."
910,"And she went out there and she found that spotlight, and she crushed that performance so hard, she had that whole audience standing on their feet screaming bloody murder!"
911,And that girl was you!
912,What?
913,How old do you think I am?
914,It was 1975! No.
915,The point is every Fosse girl knows that story.
916,It's all about finding your light.
917,"âª When a challenge lies ahead And you are filled with dread and worry âª âª Give it some zazz âª âª If your courage disappears What'll get your fears to scurry? âª âª Give it some zazz âª âª Zazz is style plus confidence âª âª It may seem corny or kitsch âª âª But when scared or on the fence âª âª You'll find that zazz Will soon make fear become your bitch âª âª And if folks say you can't win What'll stop them in a hurry? âª âª Give it some zazz âª âª There's no contest for a girl Who has some razzmatazz âª âª So call their bluff And strut your stuff âª âª Like no chick in this hick town has âª âª Instead of giving up âª âª Oh, give it some zazz âª I just don't think I can do it."
918,The thought of getting up in front of all of those people.
919,"Look at my hands, they're shaking."
920,âª If your hands are shakin' âª âª Just turn 'em into jazz hands âª  Doesn't that feel better?
921, No.
922,Try this.
923,This is awkward.
924,You don't understand the concept of zazz.
925,The zazz is not the moves.
926,The zazz comes from within.
927,Do the moves and give it some zazz.
928,Close your eyes.
929,Think about Mrs. Greene.
930,Think about that fake prom.
931,Now think of finally doing something about it.
932,"Oh, I'm seeing it! I'm seeing your zazz!"
933,"Now, follow me!"
934,"âª Do like the brave and bossy do âª âª And if they tear you apart âª âª Ask what would Bob Fosse do? âª âª He'd make the people Have a stepballchange of heart âª âª Ball change! âª âª And if folks say you can't win What'll stop them in a hurry? âª âª Give it some zazz âª âª There's no contest for a girl Who has some razzmatazz âª âª So call their bluff, bam! âª âª And strut my stuff, bam! âª âª Like no chick In this hick town has âª âª Instead of giving up âª âª Give it some zazz âª Now that you found your zazz, it's time to show it to the world."
935, You think you know how?
936, Yeah!
937,"You've sort of been, you know, the woman in my life."
938,You've been the man in mine.
939,And I was thinking this could be our last timeâ¦ We shouldn't be doing this.
940,"Oh, it's romcom Friday."
941,Romcom Friday is sacred.
942,We should be helping Emma.
943, We gotta get her on TV.
944, Sheldon is on it. Come on.
945," How does this work, anyway?"
946, It's infrared.
947, It reduces inflammation.
948," Oh, good."
949,But you can't keep it on too long.
950,It'll blow your face off.
951,What?
952,âª Someday when I'm awfully low âª âª And the world is coldâ¦ âª Saw this movie with Eddie.
953, It was our first date.
954, Was it really?
955, Yeah.
956, Mmm.
957,Then heâ¦ took me out for dinner after.
958,"Well, I took him out."
959,He didn't have any money.
960,"He was just starting out in comedy, and he didn't have the big show like now."
961,"Fifteen years, he didn't have any money."
962,And I picked up the tab. I paid.
963, That was a bad move.
964, No kidding. I'm still paying.
965,Can I make an observation?
966,Is it a pleasant observation or is it an irritating one?
967,You're not over him.
968,"No, don't say that. I am notâ¦ Trust me. I amâ¦ I am way over him."
969,"I'm just mad at myself, you know, I am soâ¦ Why it took me so long toâ¦ figure it out."
970,You know? I believed him.
971,I believed him every single time.
972,"""I promise you, it's nothing."" ""It's meaningless."
973,"She's nothing to me. It's over."" I finally got the message, you know."
974,He didn't love me.
975,He didn'tâ¦ He didn't even like me.
976,But he liked the money.
977,"Oh, yeah, so I got out."
978,I got outâ¦ and I gave him half my money.
979,"And now here we are, singing to trucks."
980,And he's got a hit TV show.
981,And I still owe him half my unemployment check.
982,It's Eddie Sharpe!
983,"Whoa, hey!"
984,"Welcome, everybody!"
985,What's today's words of wisdom?
986,Never sign a prenup!
987,And you know what the worst part is?
988,I shut down.
989,"He took my little, delicate blueberry heart, and he justâ¦ squished it."
990, What?
991," Here's what you're gonna do, okay?"
992,"You're gonna wear something heartstopping, like that yellow cape and those cute little boots."
993,"And you are gonna march down to that principal's office like a bad, bad girl."
994,Tom?
995, Tom is a fan. Friend.
996, Hmm?
997,Wellâ¦ he likes you.
998,As a fan. Friend.
999,I don't know.
1000,Not even that much anymore.
1001,"Okay, let's cut the crap."
1002,"I would kill, kill, to have a guy look at me the way that he looks at you."
1003,Stop it.
1004,You're justâ¦ You're poking my heart with your finger.
1005,"Your stillbeating, delicate little blueberry heart?"
1006,"Do you think he really, really likes me?"
1007,"Oh, my God, yes!"
1008,Barry!
1009, I love you! I love you!
1010, I love you! I love you!
1011,You're just such a greatâ¦ everything.
1012,"Okay, no, no, no. Okay."
1013,"This, the master stroke, your idea."
1014, And the boots?
1015, And the little cute boots.
1016,This is it.
1017,Oh!
1018,That is good.
1019,"Mmm, nowâ¦ you."
1020,I've been thinking about you since we got here.
1021,"Oh, God. I knew this was gonna somehow turn around to me."
1022,And I think it's time somebody poked that gay little heart of yours.
1023,Are we doing this? Fine. Uhâ¦ Do I only go for 10s when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and...
1024,"Your parents. You're from Ohio, right?"
1025,So?
1026,We're in Indiana.
1027," Ohio, Indiana,Â they're close."
1028, I can see where you're driving this.
1029,You have two living parents that you'll never be nearer to than you are right now.
1030, I think you should call them.
1031, No.
1032,They threw me away.
1033,"Well, did they really?"
1034,"I told them that I was gay, and they said that they would take me to therapy to change myself completely."
1035,Let your parents see who you are before it's too late.
1036,If you don'tâ¦ you'll regret it.
1037,I'm not the one who should have regrets.
1038,I was the kid.
1039,I was the kid!
1040,I was 16.
1041,Sixteen years old. I was terrified.
1042,Terrified!
1043,And I needed one thing from them and they couldn't give it to me.
1044,So don't youâ¦ Would the following students please report to afterschool detention?
1045,Harlan Doolittleâ¦ Hi.
1046,"â¦Olivia Blanc, Frances Doolittle."
1047,Thank you.
1048,"Well, they each had a bite."
1049," Ooh, what'd you do?"
1050," Yeah, a big bite."
1051,I appreciate it. Byebye.
1052,Am I interrupting something?
1053,"I was just doing some research, trying to figure out if urinal cakes are poisonous."
1054,"Uh, how can I help you?"
1055,"Well, I've just been wandering around town all day."
1056,I've seen theâ¦ sight.
1057,"And, umâ¦ Bottom line is I just thought you might want to take me to dinner and worship me again."
1058,"No, I would not like to do that."
1059,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do."
1060,"Okay, what's going on here?"
1061,Why is everybody always so mad at me?
1062,"Well, speaking for myself, it's because you're an opportunist."
1063,You came here for publicity.
1064,You're a terrible person.
1065,"No, no. Nobody gets to talk to me that way. Nobody!"
1066,"You know, meeting you in person has been colossally disappointing."
1067,I wanted you to be Dolores.
1068,Who the hell is Dolores?
1069,From Swallow the Moon.
1070,She was joyful.
1071,She was full of courage and hope.
1072," Okay, but she was fictional."
1073, But you made her real.
1074,"When you sang ""The Lady's Improving"" to Troy Gibson, you were admitting you weren't perfect and you knew you could be better, and that's why he didn't fire you from the circus act."
1075,Such humility and dignity.
1076, That's who I thought you were.
1077," Well, I'm not."
1078,I'm not Dolores.
1079,"I'm just a really, really, really good actress. And youâ¦ You're just some hick town high school teacher who can't even tell the difference between fantasy and reality."
1080, Are we done?
1081," Oh, yeah, we're done."
1082,"âª The lady's improving âª âª So don't give up hope âª âª You ask, ""Is she perfect?"" âª âª My answer is nope âª I know what you're doing."
1083,"âª Her range needs expanding âª âª Her edges need sanding âª âª But she can become a sure bet âª âª So I'm begging you, sir âª âª Don't give up on her yet âª You're trying to appeal to the fan in me."
1084,It won't work. I'm not a fan anymore.
1085,"âª The lady's improving So much that she gloats âª âª I know you've got standards âª âª Feel free to give notes âª âª There isn't an issue And that's why I wish you could see âª âª There's no reason to fret âª âª So I'm begging you, sir âª âª Don't give up on her yet âª Seriously, Dee Dee, this is unsettling."
1086,It's like having a fantasy I don't want to have.
1087,âª Everybody thinks that I've got Some kinks that I'll never work out âª âª Even you're inclined To think I'm unrefined âª âª But I promise with some time âª âª That my aptitude will climb âª âª And you'll leave your doubts And disbeliefs behind âª âª The lady's improving Removing all doubt âª Hey!
1088,âª She has hidden charms That are sure to come out âª âª You're bound to discover This book's not her cover âª I need you to stop.
1089,"âª So don't make a move you'll regret âª âª So I'm begging you, sir âª âª No reneging on her âª âª Don't give up on her âª âª Yet! âª Okay, I admit that got to me."
1090,See? See?
1091,I'm not a total lost cause.
1092,That was a totally selfless act.
1093,"I mean, people would pay premium prices for that performance."
1094,"All right, you guys are dismissed."
1095,"Dee Dee, not charging for an apology is not a selfless act."
1096,What the hell?
1097,"If you want people to like you instead of hate you, you have to be good."
1098,A good person. You have to put other people's interests before your own.
1099,You don't understand.
1100,I am a celebrity.
1101,It is all about me.
1102,It has been for decades.
1103,That's the point of celebrity.
1104,So I have to be reprogrammed.
1105,I have to unlearn things like shoving and taking.
1106, You knowâ¦  Yes.
1107,I need help with that. I need aâ¦ teacher.
1108,Please.
1109,Let's go someplace and talk about how to be good human beings.
1110,Apples & Bees?
1111,Hi.
1112,Thanks for meeting me.
1113,I was afraid you wouldn't come...
1114,What do you want?
1115, I'm sorry about what happened.
1116, Were you in on it?
1117,Emma! You know me.
1118,Do I?
1119,What is this?
1120,What are we?
1121," No, you know what we are."
1122," No, I don't."
1123,"Do you know what it was like standing there in that stupid dress alone in the gym, knowing that people got together and planned the best way to hurt me?"
1124, That must've been awful.
1125, It was.
1126,But the worst partâ¦ The worst part was that you didn't come even though you knew what happened.
1127,You didn't come and try and hold my hand or take me out of there.
1128," I couldn't, okay?"
1129, Why?
1130,You know what my mother is like.
1131,She's a complete and total control freak.
1132,"âª The hair has to be perfect âª âª The A's have to be straight âª âª You have to join the debate club On that there's no debate âª âª You'll have Bible camp each summer To keep you pure and clean âª âª Endless rules apply When you're Alyssa Greene âª âª Trophies have to be first place Ribbons have to be blue âª âª There's always some competition Or hoops for jumping through âª âª Your mom's made sacrifices So win homecoming queen âª âª 'Cause it's doordie When you're Alyssa Greene âª âª And you wish there was a world Where you were simply free to live âª âª And when people criticize you You had no more shits to give âª âª And in this other lifetime âª âª When you tell yourself ""be brave"" You won't cave âª âª That's the one thing I truly crave âª âª But your feelings have to be phony Your weight has to be tracked âª âª If you don't like shaking pompoms You'd better learn to act âª âª Just have everything perfected By the time you reach 18 âª âª Don't ask how or why When you're Alyssa Greene âª âª Improve all of your strong points And hide things that you lack âª âª 'Cause Mom's convinced if you're perfect Your father might come back âª âª You're not yourself âª âª You're not what she wants You're someone in between âª âª Your whole life's a lie When you're Alyssa Greene âª I'm gonna go public and tell my story."
1133, Will you do it with me?
1134, I want to. I...
1135,"Yeah, wanting to isn't enough."
1136,I believe you have feelings for me.
1137,But I can't do this anymore.
1138,It hurts too much.
1139,Are you breaking up with me?
1140,"I guess I am, yeah."
1141,Bye.
1142,"âª You're not yourself âª âª You're not what she wants You're someone in between âª I saw it on CNN. They said that Edgewater, Indiana overflows with bigotry."
1143,"Hey, look."
1144,It's that guy from Talk to the Hand.
1145,"Hey, guys. I was just taking a walk, enjoying the sweet scent of Americana."
1146,We're not interested.
1147,"I feel like there's an ideological divide between us, but if we got to know each other, we could bridge it, right?"
1148,So I'll start.
1149,I'm Trent. I'm an actor.
1150,My instrument was forged in the fiery furnace that is Juilliard.
1151,I'm sure your drama teachers told you about that institution.
1152, We don't have a drama program.
1153, Explains your general lack of empathy.
1154,Let's start with you.
1155, Me?
1156, Yes. Why do you hate gay people?
1157," Hey, I'm a good person, right, Shelby?"
1158," Yeah. Yeah, we all are."
1159, We go to church.
1160," Yeah, we're Christian."
1161,"Well, I'm sure there are a lot of rules in the Bible that you break every day."
1162,"Well, that's different."
1163,Is it?
1164,"You can't cherrypick the Bible, choosing which parts you want to believe."
1165,We don't do that.
1166,"Uh, you don't?"
1167,Then what's this?
1168,"âª Kaylee has a small tattoo âª âª That tattoo would be taboo âª âª Kaylee, guess what waits for you âª What?"
1169,âª An eternity in the fiery pits of hell âª Hey!
1170,"âª Shelby, you seem sweet to me âª âª But if it has come to be âª âª You've lost your virginity âª âª We'll be stoning you And your family as well âª What?"
1171,âª Or we could use Some common sense instead âª âª When you're lost It always helps recalling âª âª Those immortal words that Jesus said âª Really?
1172,"âª There's one rule that trumps them all âª âª Love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor trumps them all âª âª Love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor trumps them all âª  You know, you kind of make sense."
1173, What are you talking about?
1174,"Oh, come on. You guys don't even feel, like, slightly bad for Emma?"
1175," I mean, you guys used to hang out."
1176, That was before she turned gay.
1177,Maybe she was always gay.
1178,"Exactly, because that's the way God made her, Shelby."
1179, Come on. What?
1180, Whatever.
1181, Hey! It's the Godspell kids!
1182," Hey, Trent. What's going on?"
1183, You guys'll back me up.
1184, With what?
1185,He's just trying to confuse us.
1186,Because my stepdad always says...
1187,Stepdad?
1188,Do you mean your parents are divorced?
1189,"Yeah, and?"
1190,"Well, divorce is a big nono."
1191,"âª Not to oversimplify âª âª But the scripture does imply âª âª That your mom will have to die âª âª How's tomorrow If she's not got any plans? âª âª There's no way to separate âª âª Which rules you can violate âª âª Let's hope you don't masturbate âª âª 'Cause the scripture says We'll have to cut off yourâ¦ âª âª Hands âª âª Or we could use Some common sense instead âª âª When you're lost It always helps recalling âª âª Those immortal words that Jesus said âª âª There's one rule that trumps them all âª âª Love thy neighbor, love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor trumps them all âª âª Love thy neighbor, love thy neighbor âª âª Love thy neighbor trumps them all âª âª Love thy neighbor âª Yes!"

1194," Hi, everyone."
1195, Hi!
1196,"It's okay, it's okay."
1197,He knows what we're up to.
1198,"And I'm on board, as long as Emma's comfortable with it."
1199,"Well, she's outta luck, 'cause we got nothin'."
1200,"Uh, it's not over yet. Dee Dee."
1201, I have arranged a TV appearance for herâ¦  Mmm!
1202,â¦on Eddie Sharpe.
1203,She's booked for tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.
1204,Not the house in the Hamptons.
1205,Yes.
1206,"Hello, Eddie, it's Dee Dee, your brutalized exwife."
1207,But I'm calling on another matter entirely.
1208,What I didâ¦ was I put her interest ahead of my own.
1209, Mmmhmm.
1210, I expect nothing in return.
1211,I have no agenda other than to ease someone else's burden.
1212,"Oh, Dee Dee, that is incredibly generous of you!"
1213,I know!
1214,Hang on. What kind of audience are we talking about here?
1215,"I mean, Eddie Sharpe on a weekday?"
1216,"Fifteen, sixteen million!"
1217, Dee Dee! You saved the day!
1218," Yeah, I did."
1219, I love giving back. It's my new thing.
1220, There you go!
1221, Emma!
1222, Hi.
1223,Emma! You wait until you hear the news.
1224,Dee Dee has got you booked on Eddie Sharpe tomorrow at 8:00 with an audience of 16 million people!
1225,Wow! That's amazing. Thank you.
1226,"Oh, I'm justâ¦ I'm so happy to be able to help."
1227,And I'm gonna take a stand.
1228,"And I want to thank you all because without your love and support, I never would have found the courage."
1229,"But, um, the reason I came was to tell you thatâ¦ I'm going to do it my way."
1230,I'm not going on TV.
1231, You owe me a house!
1232," Oh, my God."
1233, You owe me a house!
1234," Go, go!"
1235, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
1236, Run! Run!
1237,She owes me a house! She owes me my house!
1238,I need my house.
1239,She's a very passionate woman.
1240,So here's what's gonna happen.
1241,"I'm gonna do my thing, and in the end, there will be a kickass prom in Edgewater, Indiana, for everybody, regardless of who they happen to love."
1242,I know it.
1243,Thatâ¦ That would be wonderful.
1244,"And when that happens, I want you to be my date."
1245,"Wait, but what aboutâ¦ We broke up."
1246,Just say yes.
1247,There's no one in the world I'd rather go with.
1248,God. Don't make me cry.
1249,Of course I will go with you.
1250,We are going to the prom.
1251,God.
1252,I can't believe it.
1253,âª I'm oddly excited âª âª Perhaps that's because âª âª Although it shouldn't matter âª âª It somehow does âª âª It's strange But I feel like I'm in a time machine âª âª 'Cause guess what?
1254,"It's like I'm suddenly 17 âª âª So book a white limo, uncork the Dom âª âª After 21 years I am finally going to prom âª âª I once thought A night like this wasn't in the cards âª âª Now I've got a date, a tux And the whole nine yards âª âª A rational person would just stay calm âª âª Oh, since when am I rational? âª âª Barry is going to prom! âª âª The prom! âª âª I wish I could tell that sad kid I was âª âª To stop crying into his Cheetos âª âª They say, ""It gets better"" âª âª Guess what? It does âª âª Who cares if you're a big old girl? âª âª Just get into that gym and twirl âª âª Barry's going to the âª âª To the freakin' prom âª Going to the prom."
1255,"âª In showbiz I never felt such a thrill divine âª âª My date is a high school lesbian Still it's fine âª âª And though it's been years I might call my mom âª âª And tell her that though it's overdue All of my waiting is over too âª âª And if you're not happy, I'm over you âª âª 'Cause Barry âª âª Yes, Barry âª Go on."
1256,"âª Look at me, Mom âª âª Barry's going toâ¦ âª âª Prom âª âª Yeah! âª Hello, interweb."
1257,"My name is Emma Nolan, and I'm 17 and I'm gay."
1258,You might have heard about the fake prom in Indiana.
1259,That was me.
1260,"It was awful in every way, and I spent a lot of time feeling sorry for myself."
1261,So I wrote a song for all the people out there who love someone in a way that the world just doesn't understand.
1262,"I know we all have stories to tell, and here's mine."
1263,"âª Some hearts can conform Fitting the norm âª âª Flaunting their love for all to see âª âª I tried to change Thinking how easy life could be âª âª I just kept on failing âª âª I guess that was a sign âª âª That there wasn't much hope âª âª For this unruly heart âª âª Of mine âª âª Then you came along And right or wrong âª âª Feelings began to overflow âª âª We had to hide Thinking that no one else could know âª âª And not having you near me Was where I drew the line âª âª So I had to conceal âª âª This poor unruly heart âª âª Of mine âª Hi, Emma."
1264,I loved your video. Where do I start?
1265,I think my parents always knew.
1266,I felt so alone.
1267,Nothing made sense until him.
1268,She's the best thing in my life.
1269,The only good thing.
1270,But we're always hiding.
1271,You're not the only one.
1272,âª And though I don't know how or when âª âª But somehow I learned to see âª âª No matter what The world might say âª âª This heart is the best part of me âª âª So fear's all in the past Fading so fast âª âª I won't stay hidden anymore âª âª I'm who I am âª âª And I think that's worth fighting for âª âª And nobody out there âª âª Ever gets to define âª âª The life I'm meant to lead âª âª With this unruly heart âª âª Of mine âª âª Mine âª âª And nobody out there âª âª Ever gets to define âª âª The life I'm meant to lead âª âª With this unruly heart âª âª Of mine âª This is too much.
1273,It's too much for my heart.
1274,That's why I wanted you guys to see it.
1275,I've never been more proud.
1276, So when is the prom?
1277, There's no money left.
1278, What? What do you mean?
1279," We already had a prom, remember?"
1280,There could be a miracle. It's early.
1281,"Okay, people, it's Mickey and Judy time. Okay?"
1282,This is the part where we roll up our sleeves and we put on a prom with our own bare hands.
1283, We are giving Emma the prom she deserves.
1284," Okay, wait a minute."
1285,How much are we talking about?
1286,What does a prom cost?
1287,"I mean, it's not a schoolsanctioned event, so we have to pay a rental fee on the gym."
1288,DJ.
1289, Lighting.
1290, Sound system.
1291,It's still thousands of dollars.
1292,"Right. Umâ¦ Okay, here."
1293,"Charge that until it declines, which will be soon."
1294,I had to declare bankruptcy after my selfproduced Notes on a Scandal.
1295,"Yes. Wellâ¦ I don't have a credit card anymore because Iâ¦ Well, I justâ¦ But, anyway, you can have what I have in my Venmo and there's my cash."
1296,It's all yours.
1297," Thanks, Angie."
1298, Sure.
1299,Okay. This is my card from the Actors Federal Credit Union.
1300,Just cross your fingers and swipe.
1301,"All right. Well, we're making some progress here. This is a nice start."
1302,Umâ¦  We still have a long way to go.
1303, Mmmhmm.
1304, Dee Dee. Dee Dee?
1305, What?
1306,"Oh, come on. I know you've got an American Express black card in there."
1307,There's no limit on that baby.
1308,"Please, please, no."
1309,I already gave a house.
1310,"Exactly, so this is nothing. Come on."
1311,Eleanor.
1312,Franklin.
1313,Why does being good cost so muchâ¦ money?
1314,"Well done, Dee Dee."
1315, Yes!
1316, We're fully financed.
1317, Yeah!
1318," Okay, well, let's give this girl a prom!"
1319, Yes!
1320," Okay, let's do it!"
1321,The students will want to see us perform some sort of number.
1322,"So, look, Iâ¦ I've been thinking hard about this."
1323,Mmm.
1324,That thing that you and I were talking about.
1325, I called your mother.
1326, What?
1327,"Yeah, I found her number in your phone."
1328,How did you know my passcode?
1329,"Well, I guessed. 9481. BeyoncÃ©'s birthday."
1330,Got it on the first try.
1331," Well, why would you do that?"
1332," Because, Barryâ¦  I know you couldn't do it on your own."
1333, What did she say?
1334,"Well, I think maybe you should let her tell you that."
1335,"Hi, Barry."
1336,"Okay. I'm gonna give you some space, and I'll be in the faculty lounge, okay?"
1337,"No. No, youâ¦ You don't get to do this. Okay?"
1338,You don't get to show up out of nowhere. Okay? No. Uhuh.
1339,"I came all this way, Barry."
1340,"Well, you can just turn around and go right back, okay?"
1341,"You called me, didn't you?"
1342,"That was you who called and hung up, wasn't it?"
1343,"I handled this all wrong, honey."
1344,And I'm so sorry.
1345,"Okay. You justâ¦ stayâ¦ When you told us what you were, who you were, your father and I, we were scared."
1346,We hardly knew what gay meant.
1347,"We both thought that somehow we had failed you, like maybe it was our fault."
1348,So it's okay now?
1349,What I needed was a mother who didn't know if it was okay but loved me anyway.
1350,You think you were scared?
1351,How do you think I felt?
1352,"I know, Barry."
1353,I failed you and I know.
1354,That's gonna be on my heart till the day I die.
1355,But all I can say is I was wrong and I'm sorry.
1356,What about Dad? Is he here?
1357,"Uh, no. He's just notâ¦ He's not there yet."
1358,I'm sorry to say.
1359,"Oh, Barry."
1360,Please forgive me.
1361,I've missed you so much.
1362,I missed you too.
1363,I did.
1364,I missed you too. I missed you.
1365,âª Then you came along And right or wrongâ¦ âª  Aren't you tired of watching that?
1366, Eight million people have seen it.
1367,I just don't understand it.
1368,"Well, I think it's brave."
1369,The kids are saying there's gonna be another prom.
1370,Someone's offered to pay for it.
1371,Who?
1372,This is so generous of you guys.
1373,We had to do something after you broke the Internet.
1374,It was crazy.
1375,"The numbers just kept going up, and then the Indiana Star called, and then the Washington Post..."
1376,"Hello, everyone."
1377,Can't have a prom without flowers.
1378,"So I will put these out on the table, even though I'd rather just give them all to you."
1379," Oh, my God!"
1380, Is this for real?
1381,Can I just say you guys are the best middleaged people I've ever met.
1382,"That isâ¦ Oh, honeyâ¦ We need to talk to you about something, okay? And I think it'sâ¦ It's important that you understand the real reason why we came here to visit you."
1383,It wasn't for the Hoosier pie?
1384,"Well, I mean, umâ¦  We were in a show."
1385, A wonderful show.
1386,"Well, I meanâ¦ And we got blasted by the critics."
1387,"They called us narcissists, and it hurt."
1388,And it hurt because I guess they were right.
1389,So we looked around for a cause that might give us some credibility.
1390,Maybe get us some good press.
1391,Like building a house for Habitat for Humanity.
1392,Then we realized that we're not capable of building anything.
1393,And then I found you on Twitter.
1394,"I mean, it was just dumb luck, but meant to be."
1395,"Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, butâ¦ you're going to build something."
1396,You're going to build a prom.
1397,"Stop it! Stop this, please!"
1398,Who gave you people permission to be in here?
1399, I did.
1400, You should have consulted with the PTA.
1401,"Well, this is not a school event, so I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval."
1402,I'm going to be as clear as I possibly can.
1403,Your beliefs are not our beliefs.
1404,"Hey, Emma. Can we talk to you?"
1405,"I was a jerk, and I'm sorry."
1406,You deserve to go to prom just like any other kid.
1407,What? I thought you hated me.
1408,I thought you all hated me.
1409,"Oh, they hated you."
1410,They hated you with a burning passion stoked by centuries of intolerance and the lack of a drama program.
1411,"I'm sorry, too, Emma."
1412,"You know, you explain things really well."
1413,"You should be, like, a teacher."
1414," Oh, you should be our drama teacher!"
1415," Yes, please!"
1416,You should do it. Do it.
1417, You're hired!
1418, I'm a teacher!
1419, As a temp.
1420, Absolutely.
1421,"No, no, no! This is..."
1422,This is what I was afraid of.
1423, Mom!
1424, Let me finish!
1425,"No, you have got to stop talking and just listen, okay?"
1426,People don't turn gay.
1427,They are who they are.
1428,No. You don't know what you're saying.
1429,I do.
1430,I do.
1431,"Look, I know how you were raised, butâ¦ the world's a different place."
1432,"And sure, it's not great, butâ¦ it'sâ¦ it's better because of people who have the courage to be who they are."
1433,People like her.
1434,I don't want to hurt you.
1435,I don't want to hurt anyone.
1436,I just want to be me.
1437,So here goes.
1438," I love you, Emma Nolan."
1439," Oh, my God."
1440,I love you too.
1441,"Alyssaâ¦ No, listen to me."
1442,You are very young and you are confused.
1443,You don't know what isâ¦ I just don't want you to have a hard life.
1444,It's already hard.
1445," Mom, I love you..."
1446, No.
1447,We'llâ¦ We can talk about this tonight.
1448,Okay? Okay?
1449, Okay.
1450, Okay. Okay.
1451,Momâ¦  Just breathe.
1452," Hey, why don't we decorate?"
1453,"Yes, let's decorate."
1454,Let's decorate everything.
1455, All right.
1456, I need you here.
1457,We're gonna make this place really pretty.
1458,Look at that!
1459,I'm so proud of you. Look at what you did.
1460,I can't believe this.
1461,I think we're early.
1462," Yeah, it looks like it."
1463, Mmhmm.
1464,You want to hit up the punch bowl?
1465,No. There's only one thing that I want to do.
1466,"âª I just wanna dance with you âª âª Let the whole world melt away And dance with you âª âª Who cares What other people say? âª âª And when we're through âª âª No one can convince us we were wrong âª âª All it takes is you and me âª âª And a song âª âª I just wanna dance with you âª âª Let the whole world melt away âª  âª I just wanna dance with you âª  âª And dance with you âª Oh, my! Are you kidding me?"
1467,This is amazing.
1468, Our first promgoers have arrived.
1469, Yeah.
1470," Girls, this is unbelievable."
1471," Oh, look at you. You're so beautiful!"
1472,"You look incredible, sweetheart!"
1473, Can you believe we pulled this off?
1474, I can't!
1475,And kids are coming from all over the state.
1476, We're letting them in in one minute.
1477, So let's do this right.
1478,"âª One thing you've taught me âª âª Is how much people enjoy a show âª âª And so you've got me âª âª Debating How this whole night should go âª âª Kids will be watching âª âª To see who every guest is âª âª And so my only request is âª âª Build a prom for everyone âª âª Show them all it can be done âª âª If music blares and no one cares Who your unruly heart loves âª âª Build it now âª âª Make people see how the world Could one day be âª âª It might come true if we take a chance âª âª But till that day comes I say cue the drums âª âª It's time to dance âª âª I just want to dance with you âª âª I just want to dance with you âª  Oh, my God!"
1479, What?
1480,I just got the call!
1481,Tina Louise has shingles!
1482,They want me to go on as Roxie Hart!
1483,What'd you tell 'em?
1484," I said, ""No way. I got a prom to go to.""  Attagirl!"
1485,No! Just kiddin'.
1486,I'm on the redeye tomorrow.
