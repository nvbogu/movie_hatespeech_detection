253, agrarian precapitalist.
254, Let me tell you somethin´.

256,You´re a firstyear grad student.
257,"You just got finished readin´ some Marxian historian Pete Garrison, probably You´re gonna be convinced of that till next month when you get to James Lemon."
258,Then you´re gonna be talkin´ about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...
259,were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740.
260,"That´s gonna last until next year. You´re gonna be in here regurgitatin´ Gordon Wood, talkin´ about, you know, the prerevolutionary utopia..."
261,and the capitalforming effects of military mobilization.
262," SCOFFS  Well, as a matter of fact, I won´t, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions..."
263,"predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth."
264,"You got that from Vickers´ Work in Essex County. Page 98, right ?"
265,I read that too. Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us ?

270,"See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years, you´re gonna start doin´ some thinkin´ on your own."
271,You´re gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life.
272,One: Don´t do that.
273,And two: You dropped 150 grand on a fuckin´ education...
274,you could´ve got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.

478,"  GRUNTING  Ah, Henry."
479," Hi, Gerry."
480,You know something ?
481,I can´t do this pro bono work anymore.
482, It´s just not It´s not worth it.
483, What happened ?
484,"Well, l´m going on national television next week."
485,"I mean, I haven´t got time to tell you, much less talk to that raving looney in there."
486,"An absolute lunatic, he is."
487, LAMBEAU  Henry.
488," MAN  Okay, you are in your bed, Will."
489,"Now, how old are you ?"
490,Seven.
491,What do you see ?
492,Something´s in my room.
493,What is it ?
494,It´s like a It´s a figure.
495,It´s hoverin´ over me.
496,"You are in a safe place, Will."
497,It´s t  SIGHS  lt´s touchin´ me.
498,Where is it touching you ?
499,"It´s touching me down there, and l´m nervous."
500,"You don´t have to be nervous, Will."
501,We start dancin´ and dancin´.
502,"It´s just beautiful, ´cause we can make..."
503,a lot of love before the sun goes down.
504," Skyrockets in flight   Afternoon delight    Hey, hey, hey, afternoon delight   Jesus."
505," Skyrockets in flight Dadadada   I´m sorry, Rich."
506, I have better things to do with my time.
507," Hey, hey, afternoon delight  Come on ! One dance !"
508,"You really hypnotized me, you know ?"
509," For God´s sake, Will."
510," What ? Oh, come on. He left."
511,You can´t pin that on me.
512, I told you to cooperate with these people.
513, Look...
514, into my eyes.
515," Get out, Will."
516,I don´t need therapy.
517, That´s enough. Get out !
518,"  IMITATING SPOOKY SOUND   I called Mel Weintraub this morning to see  Oh, what´s the use ?"
519,What do you want to do ?
520,"  SIGHS  Well, there´s someone."
521, Who is he ?
522,"He used to be my, uh my roommate in college."
523,Trust. Very important in a relationship.
524,It´s also very important in a clinical situation.
525,Why is trust the most important thing...
526,in making a breakthrough with a client ?
527,"Maureen, stop the oral fixation for a moment and join us."
528, Vinnie.
529," Um Because, uh Trust is, uh Trust is life."
530,Wow. That´s very deep.
531,"Thank you, Vinnie."
532," PROFESSOR  Next time, get the notes from your brother."
533,"If a patient doesn´t feel safe enough trust you, then they won´t be honest with you."
534,Then there´s really no point for them being in therapy.
535,"I mean, hey, if they don´t trust you, you´re never gonna get them to sleep with you."
536,That should be the goal of any good therapist. Nail ´em while they´re vulnerable.
537,That´s my motto.
538,"Oh, good, everyone´s back."
539,"Welcome back, everybody."
540," Hello, Sean."
541," Hey, Gerry."
542,"Um, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the presence of greatness."
543,"Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field´s medal winner for combinatorial mathematics."
544, Hello.
545, Anyone know what the Field´s medal is ?
546,It´s a really big deal.
547,It´s like the Nobel prize for math.
548,Except they only give it out once every four years. It´s a great thing.
549,It´s an amazing honor.
550,"Okay, everybody, that´s it for today."
551,Thanks. We´ll see you Monday.
552,We´ll be talking about Freud.
553,Why he did enough cocaine to kill a small horse. Thank you.
554, How are you ?
555, It´s good to see you.
556,Good to see you.
557," Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya."
558, Yeah ?
559,"What, you have to have blood and urine ? What´s up ?"
560,Why didn´t you come to the reunion ?
561,"You know, l´m I´ve been busy."
562, You were missed.
563, Really ?
564, So how long has it been since we´ve seen each other ?
565, Before Nancy died.
566,"Yeah, l´m sorry."
567,I was in Paris.
568,It was that damn conference.
569,I got your card.
570,It was nice.
571, GRUNTING   Come here.
572, Now that´s a takedown.
573,"Hey, what happened ?"
574,Did you get leniency or what ?

582," Sean, Sean."
583,ThisThis boy is incredible.

585,"What makes him so incredible, Gerry ?"
586, You ever heard of Ramanujan ?

588,It´s a man. He lived over 100 years ago. He was lndian.
589," Dots, not feathers."
590, Not feathers. Yeah.
591,He lived in this tiny hut somewhere in lndia.
592,He had no formal education.
593, He had no access to any scientific work.
594, Coffee ?
595," You, sir ?"
596, Just a little.
597,"But he came across this old math book, and from the simple text, he was able to extrapolate theories..."
598,that had baffled mathematicians for years.
599,Yes. Continued fractions.
600,"He wrote, uh  Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge."
601," Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah."
602, And Hardy immediately recognized the brilliance of his work...
603, Mmhmm.
604,"and brought him over to England, and then they worked together for years, creating some of the most exciting math theory ever done."
605,"ThisThis Ramanujan hishis genius was unparalleled, Sean."
606," Well, this boy´s just like that."
607, Hmm.
608, But he´s he´s a bit defensive.
609, Hmm.
610,I need someone who can get through to him.
611, Like me ?
612," Yeah, like you."
613, Why ?
614," Well, because you have the same kind of background."
615, What background ?
616," Well, you´re from the same neighborhood."
617, He´s from Southie ?
618, Yeah.

624, Yeah. Yeah.
625," Sean, please, just meet with him once a week."
626, Mmhmm.
627,Please ?
628,It´s a poker game with this kid.
629,Don´t let him know what you´ve got.
630,"He probably even read your book, if he could find it."
631,It´s gonna be hard for him to find.
632," Hi, Will."
633, Hi.
634,This is Sean Maguire.
635,Will Hunting.
636,How are ya ?

647,I like what you´ve done with the place.
648,"Oh, thanks."
649,"Do you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for, like, a ""shrink kit"" that comes with all these volumes included ?"
650, Do you like books ?
651, Yeah.
652, Did you read any of these books ?
653, I don´t know.
654, How about any of these books ?
655, Probably not.
656,What about the ones on the top shelf ? You read those ?
657," Yeah, I read those."
658, Good for you. What do you think about ´em ?
659,I´m not here for a fuckin´ book report. They´re your books.
660,Why don´t you read ´em ?
661,I did. I had to.
662, Must´ve taken you a long time.
663," Yeah, it did."
664,"United States of America: A Complete History, Volume l."
665,"Jesus. If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard Zinn´s A People´s History in the United States."
666,That book´ll fuckin´ knock you on your ass.
667,Better than Chomsky´s Manufacturing Consent ?
668, Do you think that´s a good book ?
669, You fuckin´ people baffle me.
670,You spend all your money on these fuckin´ fancy books.
671,You surround yourselves with ´em.
672, They´re the wrong fuckin´ books.
673," What are the right fuckin´ books, Will ?"
674, Whatever blows your hair back.
675, Yeah. Haven´t got much hair left.
676,"Hey, you know you´d be better shoving that cigarette up your ass."
677, It´d probably be healthier for you.
678," Yeah, I know."
679, It really gets in the way of my yoga.
680," You work out, huh ?"
681," What, you lift ?"
682, Yeah.
683, Nautilus ?
684," No, free weights."
685," Oh, really ? Free weights, huh ?"

696,Do you like art ?
697, Do you like music ?
698, This is a real piece of shit.
699,"Oh, tell me what you really think."
700,Just the linear and impressionistic mix makes a very muddled composition.
701,"It´s also a Winslow Homer ripoff, except you got whitey rowin´ the boat there."
702,"Well, it´s art, Monet."
703,It wasn´t very good.
704, That´s not really what concerns me though.
705, What concerns you ?
706,Just the coloring.
707,You know what the real bitch of it is ?
708,It´s paintbynumber.
709,Is it colorbynumber ? Because the colors are fascinating to me.
710, Aren´t they really ?
711, You bet.
712,I think you´re about one step away from cuttin´ your fuckin´ ear off.
713, Really ?
714," Oh, yeah."
715,"Think I should move to the south of France, change my name to ""Vincent"" ?"
716," You ever heard the sayin´, ""any port in a storm"" ?"
717, Yeah.
718," Yeah, maybe that means you."
719, In what way ?
720," Maybe you´re in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin´ storm."
721," Yeah, maybe."
722,The sky´s fallin´ on your head.
723,The waves are crashin´ over your little boat.
724,The oars are about to snap.
725, SNIFFING  You just piss in your pants.
726,You´re cryin´ for the harbor.
727,So maybe you do what you gotta do to get out.
728,"You know, maybe you became a psychologist."
729,Bingo. That´s it. Let me do my job now.
730,You start with me. Come on.
731, Maybe you married the wrong woman.
732, Maybe you should watch your mouth !
733,"Watch it right there, chief, all right ?"
734,Ah.
735,"That´s it, isn´t it ?"
736,You married the wrong woman.
737,What happened ?
738,"What, did she leave you ?"
739,"Was she, you know  WHISTLING  banging some other guy ?"
740,"If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you."
741,I will fuckin´ end you.
742,"Got that, chief ?"
743,Time´s up.
744,Yeah.
745,"At ease, gentlemen."
746,You okay ?
747,"Look, l´ll understand if you don´t wanna meet with him again."
748,"Thursday, 4:00."

750,Yeah.
751,Thanks.
752," CHATTERING  Well, you look lovely in those glasses."

755," Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow."
756, Wonderful.
757,"Growing up in England, you know, I went to a very nice school."
758,"You know, it was kind of progressive, organic, doityourself, private school."
759,Then Harvard.
760,Hopefully med school.
761,"You know, I figured out, by the end, my brain´s gonna be worth $250,000."
762,"That sounded horrible, didn´t it ?"
763,  CLAKING   Bring me another mai tai !
764,"Yeah, that´s cool. I mean, I bet your parents were happy to pay."
765,"No, I was happy to pay."
766,I inherited the money.
767,Wow. Is Harvard gettin´ all that money ?
768,"No, Stanford. I´m going there in June when I graduate."
769,"All right, so you just wanted to use this sailor and then run away, huh ?"
770,"I was gonna, you know, experiment on you for anatomy class first, obviously."
771,"In that case, that´s fine."
772," Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar ?"
773, Of course.
774,All right.
775,Promise to All right.
776," This one´s for you, Rudolph."
777," Wait, wait. You need my wand."
778,"All right, give me a hit."
779,Thank you. All right.
780,I´m gonna make all these caramels disappear.

785,That was my It works better when I have my rabbit.
786,"WELL  CLEARS THROAT  I don´t really date, you know, that much."
787,How very unfortunate...
788,I think for me.  CHUCKLING  You know what I mean ?
789,I know you´ve been thinking about it.
790," Oh, no, I haven´t."
791," Yes, you have."
792," No, I really haven´t."
793," Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss."
794,"No, you know, I tell ya, I was hopin´ to get a good night laid."
795," LAUGHING  But l´ll settle for, like, a kiss, you know ?"
796, How very noble of you.
797, Thank you.
798, Mm.
799," No, I was I was hopin´ for a kiss."
800,"Well, why don´t we just get it out of the way now ?"
801, Right now ?
802, Yeah.
803,Come on.
804, GIGGLING  I think I got some of your pickle.
805,"You again, huh ?"
806,Come with me.
807,So what´s this ?
808,A Taster´s Choice moment between guys ?
809,"This is really nice. You got a thing for swans ? ls this, like, a fetish ?"
810,"Is it something, like, maybe we need to devote some time to ?"
811, Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
812, Oh.
813,Stayed up half the night thinking about it.
814,Something occurred to me.
815,"I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep and haven´t thought about you since."
816, You know what occurred to me ?
817, No.
818,You´re just a kid. You don´t have the faintest idea what you´re talking about.
819," Why, thank you."
820, It´s all right.
821,You´ve never been out of Boston.
822,Nope.
823,"So if I asked you about art, you´d probably give me the skinny..."
824,on every art book ever written.
825,Michelangelo ?
826,You know a lot about him.
827,"Life´s work, political aspirations."
828,Him and the pope.
829,Sexual orientation.
830,"The whole works, right ?"
831,I bet you can´t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
832,You never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
833,Seeing that.
834,"If I ask you about women, you´ll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites."
835,You may have even been laid a few times.
836,But you can´t tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman...
837,and feel truly happy.
838,You´re a tough kid.
839,"I ask you about war, you´d probably throw Shakespeare at me, right ?"
840,"""Once more into the breach, dear friends."" But you´ve never been near one."
841,You´ve never held your best friend´s head in your lap...
842,and watch him gasp his last breath lookin´ to you for help.
843,"If I asked you about love, you´d probably quote me a sonnet, but you´ve never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable."
844,Known someone that could level you with her eyes.
845,"Feelin´ like God put an angel on Earth just for you, who could rescue you from the depths of hell."
846,"And you wouldn´t know what it´s like to be her angel, to have that love for her be there forever."
847,Through anything.
848,Through cancer.
849,And you wouldn´t know about sleepin´ sittin´ up in a hospital room...
850,"for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes..."
851,"that the terms ""visiting hours"" don´t apply to you."
852,"You don´t know about real loss, ´cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself."
853,I doubt you´ve ever dared to love anybody that much.
854,"I look at you. I don´t see an intelligent, confident man."
855,"I see a cocky, scared shitless kid."
856,"But you´re a genius, Will."
857,No one denies that.
858,No one could possibly understand the depths of you.
859,But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine.
860,You ripped my fuckin´ life apart.
861,"You´re an orphan, right ?"
862,"Do you think l´d know the first thing about how hard your life has been how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist ?"
863,Does that encapsulate you ?
864,"Personally, I don´t give a shit about all that, because You know what ? I can´t learn anything from you..."
865,I can´t read in some fuckin´ book.
866,"Unless you wanna talk about you, who you are."
867,And l´m fascinated.
868,I´m in.
869,"But you don´t wanna do that, do you, sport ?"
870,You´re terrified of what you might say.
871,"Your move, chief."
872, CHATTERING   KNOCKING   MACHINERY HUMMING   RINGING  Hello ? Hello ?
873,Hello ?
874,"Professor Valenti, are you calling me again ?"
875,Freak.
876," Oh, God."
877," Christ, who did you call ?"
878, No one. I forgot the number.
879, You fuckin´ retarded ?
880,"You went all the way out there in the rain, and you didn´t bring the number."
881,"No, it was your mother´s 900 number."
882,I just ran out of quarters.
883,Why don´t we get off on mothers ?
884,I just got off yours.
885,"  LAUGHING    BILLY  That´s pretty funny, Morgan."
886,"That´s a fuckin´ nickel, bitch."
887, Keep antagonizing me.
888,Watch what happens.
889," All right, then, Morgan."
890, Watch what happens.
891," All right, then, Morgan."
892, MORGAN  Keep fuckin´ with me.
893,No smoking.
894,"What do you mean, he didn´t talk ?"
895,You were in there for an hour.
896,He just sat there counting the seconds until the session was over.
897," Pretty impressive, actually."
898, Why would he do that ?
899,To prove to me he doesn´t have to talk to me if he doesn´t want to.
900,What is this ? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood ?
901,"Yeah, it is, and I can´t talk first."
902,"We know your theory, Alexander, but the boy´s found a simple geometrical picture."
903, A tree structure won´t work.
904, Look now.
905,He´s joining the two vertices.
906,But I can do the sum.
907," It´s how you group the terms, Alexander."
908," But, Gerry."
909,"If we do the whole thing this way, then Hey, look, look."
910, WILL  I wrote it down.
911,It´s simpler this way.
912,Sometimes people get lucky.
913,You´re a brilliant man.
914," DOOR CLOSES    WHISTLING  You know, I was on this plane once, and l´m sittin´ there, and..."
915,"the captain gets on, he does his whole, you know, ""we´ll be cruisin´ at 35,000 feet,"" but then he puts the mike down."
916, He forgets to turn it off.
917, Mmhmm.
918,So he turns to the copilot.
919,"He´s, like, ""You know, all I could use right now is a fuckin´ blow job and a cup of coffee."" So the stewardess fuckin´ goes bombin´ up from the back of the plane..."
920,to tell him the microphone´s still on.
921,"This guy in the back of the plane´s like, ""Hey, hon, don´t forget the coffee.""  CHUCKLING  You ever been on a plane ?"
922,"No, but it´s a fuckin´ joke. It works better if I tell it in the first person."
923,"Yeah, it does."
924,"I have been laid, you know ?"
925,Really ? Good for you.
926," Big time, big time."
927," Big time, huh ?"
928,I went on a date last week.
929, How´d it go ?
930, It was good.
931, Goin´ out again ?
932, I don´t know.
933, Why ?
934, Haven´t called her.
935," Christ, you´re an amateur."
936, I know what l´m doin´.
937,Yeah. Don´t worry about me.
938,I know what l´m doin´.
939,"Yeah, but this girl was, like, you know, beautiful."
940,She´s smart. She´s fun. She´s different from most of the girls l´ve been with.
941," So call her up, Romeo."
942," Why, so I can realize she´s not that smart."
943,That she´s fuckin´ boring ?
944,"You know, I mean, you don´t This girl´s, like, fuckin´ perfect right now. I don´t wanna ruin that."
945,Maybe you´re perfect right now.
946,Maybe you don´t wanna ruin that.
947,"But I think that´s a super philosophy, Will."
948,"That way, you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody."
949,My wife used to fart when she was nervous.
950,She had all sorts of wonderful idiosyncrasies.
951,"You know, she used to fart in her sleep."
952,Just thought l´d share that with you.
953,"One night it was so loud, it woke the dog up."
954," BOTH LAUGHING  She woke up and gone, like, ""Was that you ?"" I said, ""Yeah."" I didn´t have the heart to tell her. Oh, God."
955, She woke herself up ?  LAUGHING   Yes.
956,"Oh, Christ. But, Will, she´s been dead two years and that´s the shit I remember."
957,"It´s wonderful stuff, you know ?"
958,Little things like that.
959,"Yeah, but those are the things I miss the most."
960,Those little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.
961,That´s what made her my wife.
962,"Boy, and she had the goods on me too."
963,She knew all my little peccadillos.
964,"People call these things ""imperfections,"" but they´re not."
965,That´s the good stuff.
966,And then we get to choose who we let into our weird little worlds.
967,"You´re not perfect, sport."
968,And let me save you the suspense.

1368,"This isn´t about me, Sean."
1369,I´m nothing compared to this young man.
1370,You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau ?
1371,In 1905 there were hundreds of professors renown for their study of the universe.
1372,"But it was a 26yearold Swiss patent clerk, doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world."
1373,Can you imagine if Einstein would have given that up...
1374,just to get drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night.
1375,We all would have lost something.
1376,Tim would never have heard of him.
1377," Pretty dramatic, Gerry."
1378," No, it isn´t, Sean."
1379,This boy has that gift.
1380,"He just doesn´t got the direction, but we can give that to him."
1381,"Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young man graduated from University of Michigan."
1382,Did some brilliant work in mathematics.
1383,"Specifically, bounded harmonic functions."
1384,Then he went on to Berkeley.
1385,He was assistant professor.

1396, We gotta give this kid direction.
1397," Yeah He can contribute to the world, and we can help him do that."
1398,Direction´s one thing.
1399,Manipulation´s another.
1400, Sean  We have to let him find I´m not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...
1401,to ruin this boy´s life !
1402,"I was doing advanced mathematics when I was 18, and it still took me over 20 years to do something worthy of a Field´s medal."
1403,Maybe he doesn´t want what you want.
1404,There´s more to life than a fuckin´ Field´s medal.
1405,"This is too important, Sean, and it´s above personal rivalry."
1406,Wait a minute.
1407,Let´s talk about the boy.
1408,Why don´t we give him time to figure out what he wants ?
1409,"That´s a wonderful theory, Sean."
1410,"It worked wonders for you, didn´t it ?"
1411,"Yeah, it did, you arrogant fuckin´ prick !"
1412,"Oh, l´m sorry. I´m sorry that I came here today."
1413,I came here out of courtesy.
1414,I wanted to keep you in the loop.
1415,Nice to be in the loop.
1416,The boy´s in a meeting right now I set up for him over at McNeil.
1417,"Well, Will, l´m not exactly sure what you mean."
1418,We´ve already offered you a position.
1419,"Nobody in this town works without a retainer, guys."
1420,"You think you can find somebody who does, you have my blessin´."
1421,But I think we all know that person is not gonna represent you as well as I can.
1422,"Will, our offer is $84,000 a year."
1423,Retainer !
1424,Retainer.
1425,You want us to give you cash right now ?
1426,"Whoahoho. Easy Now, I didn´t say that."
1427,"Allegedly, your situation, for you, would be concurrently improved if I had..."
1428,$200 in my back pocket right now.
1429, CLEARS THROAT  I don´t think I can Larry ?
1430, I´ve got $73.
1431, Will you take a check ?
1432,Let me tell you somethin´.
1433,You´re suspect.
1434,"Yeah, you. I don´t know what your reputation is in this town, but after the shit you tried to pull today, you can bet l´ll be lookin´ into you."
1435,"Now, any business we have heretofore, you can speak with my aforementioned attorney."
1436,"Good day, gentlemen."
1437,"And until that day comes, keep your ear to the grindstone."
1438, CHATTERING   How´s it goin´ ?
1439, Fine.
1440,Yeah.
1441,Good.
1442, Want some help ?
1443, No !
1444,"Come on. Give me one little peek, and we´ll go to the batting cages."
1445,No.
1446,It is actually important that I learn this.
1447," It´s really important... to me, okay ?"
1448, All right.
1449, Why don´t we just hang out here all day ?
1450," Yes, why don´t we ?"
1451," All right, Mr. Nosey Parker."
1452,"  CHUCKLES  Seeing as you´re intent on breaking my balls,  Let me ask you a question."
1453, All right.
1454,Do you have a photographic memory ?
1455,"I don´t know. I just kind of remember. I mean, how do you remember your phone number ?"
1456,You just do.
1457, Have you studied organic chemistry ?
1458, A little bit.
1459," Oh, just for fun ?"
1460," Yeah, for kicks."
1461,"Yeah, it´s so much fun studying organic chemistry."
1462, Are you mad ?
1463,  LAUGHS  Have you completely lost your mind ?
1464,Nobody studies it for fun.
1465,"It´s not a necessity, especially for someone like you."
1466, Someone like me ?
1467, Yeah.
1468,"Someone who divides their time, fairly evenly, between batting cages and bars."
1469, I would hardly say it was a necessity.
1470, Oh.
1471,"You know, there are very smart people here at Harvard."
1472,"Even they have to study, because this is really hard."
1473,And yet... you do it so easily. I don´t understand.
1474,I don´t understand how your mind works.
1475, Did you play the piano ?
1476, I want to talk about this.
1477,"No, l´m trying to explain it to you."
1478,Do you play the piano ?
1479," Yeah, a bit."
1480," So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart."
1481," I see ""Chopsticks.""  All right, well, Beethoven, okay ?"
1482,"He looked at a piano, and it just made sense to him. He could just play."
1483, So what are you saying ?
1484,You play the piano ?
1485, Not a lick.
1486,"I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals and a box of wood."
1487,"But Beethoven, Mozart They saw it. They could just play."
1488,I couldn´t paint you a picture.
1489,I probably can´t hit the ball out of Fenway.
1490, And I can´t play the piano.
1491, But you can do my Ochem paper in under an hour.
1492,"Right. Well, I mean, when it came to stuff like that, I could always just play."
1493,That´s the best I can explain it.
1494, Come here.
1495,I have to tell you something.
1496, Huh ?
1497, I have to tell you something.
1498, Oh.
1499,Well  It´s not fair.
1500, What´s not fair ? What ?
1501,"I´ve been here for four years, and l´ve only just found you."
1502,"Well, you found me."
1503, Are you awake ?
1504, No.
1505,"Yes, you are."
1506,What ?
1507,I want you to come to California with me.
1508, You sure about that ?
1509," Oh, yeah."
1510,"Yeah, but how do you know ?"
1511,I don´t know.
1512,I just know.
1513,"Yeah, but how do you know ?"
1514,I know because I feel it.
1515, Because that´s a really serious thing you´re saying.
1516, I know.
1517,You could be in California next week...
1518,and you might find out something about me you don´t like.
1519,"Maybe you wish you hadn´t said that, but you know it´s such a serious thing you can´t take it back."
1520,"Now l´m stuck in California with someone that doesn´t really want to be with me,  just wish they had a takeback."
1521, A what ? What´s a takeback ?
1522,I don´t want a takeback. I just want you to come to California with me.
1523,"Well, I can´t go to California with you, so Why not ?"
1524,"Well, one, because I got a job here."
1525,"And, two, because I live here."
1526,"Look, um, if you don´t love me, you should just tell me."
1527,I´m not sayin´ I don´t love you.
1528,Then why ? Why won´t you come ?
1529,What are you so scared of ?
1530,What am I so scared of ?
1531,"Well, what aren´t you scared of ?"
1532,You live in this safe little world where no one challenges you Don´t tell me about my world.
1533,Don´t tell me about my world.
1534,You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town.
1535,Then you´re gonna go off to Stanford.
1536,You´re gonna marry some rich prick...
1537,who your parents will approve of...
1538,and just sit around with the other trust fund babies...
1539,"and talk about how you went slummin´, too, once."
1540,Why are you saying this ?
1541,What is your obsession with this money ?
1542,"My father died when I was 13, and I inherited this money."
1543,"You don´t think every day I wake up, and I wish I could give it back."
1544,That I would give it back in a second if it meant I could have one more day with him.
1545,"But I can´t, and that´s my life, and I deal with it."
1546,So don´t put your shit on me when you´re the one that´s afraid.
1547,I´m afraid ? What am I afraid of ?
1548,What the fuck am I afraid of ?
1549,You´re afraid of me. You´re afraid that I won´t love you back.
1550,You know what ?
1551,l´m afraid too.
1552,"But fuck it, I want to give it a shot."
1553,At least l´m honest with you.
1554, I´m not honest with you ?
1555," No, what about your 12 brothers ?"
1556, All Right.
1557,"  BELT BUCKLE JINGLES  No, you´re not going."
1558,You´re not leaving.
1559,What do you want to know ?
1560,That I don´t have 12 brothers ?
1561,That l´m a fuckin´ orphan ?
1562, You don´t want to hear that.
1563, I didn´t know that.
1564,You don´t want to hear I got fuckin´ cigarettes put out on me when I was little.
1565, I didn´t know that.
1566, That this isn´t fuckin´ surgery.
1567,"The motherfucker stabbed me. You don´t want to hear that shit, Skylar !"
1568, I do want to hear that.
1569, Don´t tell me you want that shit !
1570, I want to help you.
1571, Help me ? What the fuck ?
1572,"What do I got, a fuckin´ sign on my back that says, ""Save me"" ?"
1573, No.
1574, Do I look like I need that ?
1575," No, I just want to be with you  Don´t bullshit me !"
1576, I love you.
1577, Don´t bullshit me !
1578,Don´t you fuckin´ bullshit me !
1579,I love you.
1580,I want to hear you say that you don´t love me.
1581,Because if you say that...
1582,then I won´t call you...
1583,and I won´t be in your life.
1584,  SOBS   I don´t love you.
1585, GIGGLING  Most people never get to see how brilliant they can be.
1586,They don´t find teachers that believe in them.
1587,They get convinced they´re stupid.
1588,"I hope you appreciate what he´s doing, because l´ve seen how much he enjoys working with you, not against you."
1589,"Hello, Will."
1590,"Tom, can you get us some coffee ?"
1591,Sure.
1592,"Now, let´s see."
1593, CLEARS THROAT  Good. This is correct.
1594,I see you used Maclaurin here.
1595,"Yeah, I don´t know what you call it, but This can´t be right."
1596,This would be very embarrassing.
1597, Did you ever consider  I´m pretty sure it´s right.
1598,"Hey, look, can we do this at Sean´s office from now on ?"
1599,Because I got to knock off work to come here and the commute is killin´ me.
1600," Yeah, sure. Did you think of the possibility  That´s right."
1601,It´s right.
1602,Just take it home with you.
1603,What happened at the McNeil meeting ?
1604,I couldn´t go.
1605,I had a date.
1606,So I sent my chief negotiator.
1607,"On your own time, you can do whatever you like, Will."
1608,"But when I set up a meeting with my associates, and you don´t show up, it reflects poorly on me."
1609, Then don´t set up any more meetings.
1610, I won´t.
1611,I´ll cancel ´em.
1612,I´ll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
1613,Maybe I don´t want to spend the rest of my fuckin´ life explainin´ shit to people.
1614,I think you could show me some appreciation.
1615,A little appreciation ?
1616,Do you know how easy this is for me ?
1617,Do you have any fuckin´ idea how easy this is ? This is a fuckin´ joke.
1618,I´m sorry you can´t do this I really am Because I wouldn´t have to fuckin´ sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
1619,"Then you´d have more time to sit around and get drunk instead, wouldn´t you ?"
1620,You´re right. This is probably a total waste of my time.
1621,"You´re right, Will."
1622,"I can´t do this proof, but you can."
1623,"And when it comes to that, it´s only about just a handful of people in the world..."
1624,who can tell the difference between you and me.
1625, But l´m one of them.
1626, Sorry.
1627,"Yeah, so am l."
1628,"Most days I wish I never met you, because then I could sleep at night."
1629,I didn´t have to walk around with the knowledge that there was someone like you out there.
1630, DOOR CLOSES  I didn´t have to watch you throw it all away.
1631," DOG BARKING    PLUNKING NOTES   Bill, hold it. Did you hear that ?"
1632,  MAN MOANING  Morgan !
1633,"If you´re watchin´ pornos in my mom´s room again, l´m gonna give you a fuckin´ beatin´ !"
1634," DOOR CLOSES   FOOTSTEPS RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS   PANTING  What´s up, fellas ?"
1635,"Morgan, why don´t you jerk off in your own fuckin´ house."
1636,That´s fuckin´ filthy.
1637,I don´t have a V.C.R.
1638,in my house.
1639,Come on. Not in my glove.
1640,I didn´t use the glove.
1641,That´s my Little League glove.
1642,What do you want me to do ?
1643,"I mean, what´s wrong with you ?"
1644,You´ll hump a baseball glove ?
1645,Il just used it for cleanup.
1646,  LAUGHING   Stop jerkin´ off in my mother´s room.
1647, Is there another V.C.R. in the house ?
1648," It´s just sad, bro."
1649,So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency ?
1650,"Well, you´d be working on the cutting edge."
1651,"You´d be exposed to the kind of technology you wouldn´t see anywhere else, because we´ve classified it."
1652,"Superstring theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms."
1653,Code breaking.
1654,That´s one aspect of what we do.
1655,"Oh, come on."
1656,That is what you do.
1657,You guys handle 80% of the intelligence workload.
1658,You´re seven times the size of the C.I.A.
1659,"We don´t like to brag about that, Will, but you´re exactly right."
1660,"So the way I see it, the question isn´t: ""Why should you work for the N.S.A. ?"" The question is: ""Why shouldn´t you ?"" Why shouldn´t I work for the N.S.A. ?"
1661,"That´s a tough one, but l´ll take a shot."
1662,Say l´m workin´ at the N.S.A.
1663,and somebody puts a code on my desk.
1664,Something no one else can break.
1665,Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.
1666,I´m real happy with myself because I did my job well.
1667,But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.
1668,"Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels are hidin´."
1669,"Fifteen hundred people that I never met, never had no problem with, get killed."
1670,"Now the politicians are saying, ""Send in the Marines to secure the area,"" ´cause they don´t give a shit."
1671,"It won´t be their kid over there gettin´ shot, just like it wasn´t them when their number got called ´cause they were in the National Guard."
1672,It´ll be some kid from Southie over there takin´ shrapnel in the ass.
1673,He comes back to find the plant he used to work at...
1674,"got exported to the country he got back from, and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job..."
1675,´cause he´ll work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
1676,"Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place..."
1677,was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.
1678,"Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices."
1679,"A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain´t helpin´ my buddy at 2.50 a gallon."
1680,"They´re takin´ their sweet time bringin´ the oil, of course."
1681,"Maybe they even took the liberty to hire an alcoholic skipper, who likes to drink martinis and fuckin´ play slalom with the icebergs."
1682,"It ain´t too long till he hits one, spills the oil..."
1683,and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic.
1684,"So now my buddy´s out of work, he can´t afford to drive, so he´s walkin´ to the fuckin´ job interviews..."
1685,which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is givin´ him chronic hemorrhoids.
1686,"Meanwhile, he´s starvin´, ´cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they´re servin´..."
1687,is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
1688,So what did I think ?
1689,l´m holdin´ out for somethin´ better.
1690,"I figure, fuck it. While l´m at it, why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard ?"
1691,I can be elected president.
1692, You feel like you´re alone ?
1693, What ?
1694,Do you have a soul mate ?
1695,Do I have a Define that.
1696,Somebody who challenges you.
1697," Uh, Chuckie."
1698," No, Chuckie´s family. He´d lie down in fuckin´ traffic for you."
1699,"I´m talking about someone who opens up things for you, touches your soul."
1700, I got I got  Who ?
1701, I got plenty.
1702," Well, name ´em."
1703,"Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost, O´Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke That´s great."
1704,They´re all dead.
1705, Not to me they´re not.
1706, You don´t have a lot of dialogue with them.
1707,"You can´t give back to them, Will."
1708, Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
1709, That´s what l´m saying.
1710,You´ll never have that kind of relationship in a world...
1711,"where you´re always afraid to take the first step, because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road."
1712, You gonna take the professor´s side on this ?
1713, Don´t give me a line of shit.
1714, No.
1715, I didn´t want the job.
1716,It´s not about the job. I don´t care if you work for the government.
1717,But you can do anything you want.
1718,You are bound by nothing.
1719,What are you passionate about ?
1720,What do you want ?
1721,There are guys who work their entire life layin´ brick...
1722,so their kids have a chance at the opportunities you have here.
1723, I didn´t ask for this.
1724, No.
1725,"You were born with it, so don´t cop out behind: ""l didn´t ask for this.""  What do you mean, cop out ?"
1726,What´s wrong with layin´ brick ?
1727, Nothing.
1728,There´s nothin´ wrong.
1729,That´s somebody´s home l´m buildin´.
1730,"Right. My dad laid brick, okay ?"
1731,Busted his ass so I could have an education.
1732,Exactly. That´s an honorable profession.
1733,What´s wrong with fixin´ somebody´s car ?
1734,Someone will get to work the next day because of me. That´s honor in that.
1735,"Yeah, there is, Will."
1736,There is honor in that.
1737,There´s honor in takin´ that 40minute train ride...
1738,so those college kids could come in in the morning and their floors are clean.
1739, And their wastebaskets are empty. That´s real work.
1740, That´s right.
1741,And that´s honorable. I´m sure that´s why you took that job.
1742,"I mean, for the honor of it."
1743,I just have a little question here.
1744,You could be a janitor anywhere.
1745,Why did you work at the most prestigious technical college in the whole fuckin´ world ?
1746,Why did you sneak around at night and finish other people´s formulas...
1747,that only one or two people in the world could do and then lie about it ?
1748,"´Cause I don´t see a lot of honor in that, Will."
1749,So what do you really wanna do ?
1750,I wanna be a shepherd.
1751,Really ?
1752,"I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little spread, get some sheep and tend to them."
1753, Maybe you should go do that.
1754, What ?
1755,"You know, if you´re gonna jerk off, why don´t you just do it at home with a moist towel ?"
1756, You´re chuckin´ me ?
1757," Yeah, get the fuck outta here."
1758," No, no, no, time´s not up yet."
1759," Yeah, it is."
1760, I´m not leavin´. No.
1761," You´re not gonna answer, you´re wastin´ my time."
1762,I thought we were friends.
1763," Playtime´s over, okay ?"
1764, Why are you kickin´ me out ?
1765,You´re lecturin´ me on life ?
1766,"Look at you, you fuckin´ burnout."
1767, What winds your clock ?
1768, Workin´ with you.
1769,Where´s your soul mate ? You wanna talk about soul mates ? Where is she ?
1770, Dead.
1771, That´s right. She´s fuckin´ dead.
1772,She fuckin´ dies and you just cash in your chips and you walk away ?
1773, At least I played a hand.
1774, You played a hand and you lost.
1775,You lost a big fuckin´ hand.
1776,Some people will lose a big hand like that and have the sack to ante up again.
1777,Look at me.
1778,What do you wanna do ?
1779,You and your bullshit.
1780,You got a bullshit answer for everybody.
1781,"But I ask you a very simple question and you can´t give me a straight answer, because you don´t know."
1782,"I´ll see ya, Bopeep."
1783, Fuck you.
1784, You´re the shepherd.
1785,Shepherd.
1786, WhHISPERS  White little prick.
1787,"I just wanted to, you know, um, call you up, uh, before you left, um I´ve been takin´ all these jobs interviews and stuff, so l´m not gonna be just a construction worker."
1788,"Well, you know, I never really cared about that."
1789,Yeah.
1790,I love you.
1791,Will ?
1792,You take care.
1793, Someone´s always comin´ around here    Trailin´ some new kill   Bye.
1794," Says, I seen your picture on a   Hundreddollar bill   What´s a game of chance to you   ln this world   Of real skill   So glad to meet ya   Angeles   Pickin´ up the ticket shows there´s money to be made   Go on, lose the gamble   That´s the history of the trade   Did you add up all the cards left to play   To zero   And sign up with people   Angeles   Don´t start with me tryin´  Will, come on."
1795,Will !
1796,"Will, that´s it !"
1797,We´re done !
1798,I´m sitting in your office and the boy isn´t here.
1799,"Well, it´s ten past 5:00."
1800,An hour and ten minutes late.
1801," I can make you satisfied in everything  Well, if he doesn´t show up and I file a report saying he wasn´t here..."
1802,"and he goes back to jail, he won´t be on my conscience."
1803, Now be coming true  Okay. Fine.
1804,What´s up ?
1805,Thanks.
1806,"Ah ! God, that´s good."
1807,So how´s your lady ?
1808,"Ah, she´s gone."
1809,Gone ? Gone where ?
1810,Med school.
1811,Medical school in California.

1818,I think the week after l´m 21.
1819,They gonna hook ya up with a job or what ?
1820,"Yeah, fuckin´ sit in a room and do long division for the next 50 years."
1821,"Nah, probably make some nice bank though."
1822,I´m gonna be a fuckin´ lab rat.
1823,Better than this shit.
1824,Way outta here.
1825,What do I want a way outta here for ?
1826,"I mean, l´m gonna fuckin´ live here the rest of my life."
1827,"You know, be neighbors."
1828,"You know, have little kids."
1829,Fuckin´ take ´em to Little League together up Foley Field.
1830,"Look, you´re my best friend, so don´t take this the wrong way."
1831,"But in 20 years if you´re still livin´ here, comin´ over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin´ construction, l´ll fuckin´ kill ya."
1832,That´s not a threat. That´s a fact.
1833,I´ll fuckin´ kill ya.
1834,What the fuck are you talkin´ about ?
1835," Look, you got something none of us have."
1836," Oh, come on !"
1837,Why is it always this ? I fuckin´ owe it to myself to do this or that.
1838, What if I don´t want to ?
1839," No, no, no. Fuck you."
1840,You don´t owe it to yourself.
1841,"You owe it to me, ´cause tomorrow l´m gonna wake up and l´ll be 50, and l´ll still be doin´ this shit."
1842,That´s all right.
1843,That´s fine.
1844,"I mean, you´re sittin´ on a winnin´ lottery ticket."
1845,"You´re too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that´s bullshit."
1846,´Cause l´d do fuckin´ anything to have what you got.
1847,So would any of these fuckin´ guys.
1848,Be an insult to us if you´re still here in 20 years.
1849,Hangin´ around here is a fuckin´ waste of your time.
1850, You don´t know that.
1851, I don´t ?
1852, No. You don´t know that.
1853," Oh, I don´t know that."
1854,Let me tell you what I do know.
1855,"Every day I come by your house, and I pick you up."
1856,"We go out and have a few drinks and few laughs, and it´s great."
1857,You know what the best part of my day is ?
1858,It´s for about ten seconds: from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door.
1859,´Cause I think maybe l´ll get up there and l´ll knock on the door and you won´t be there.
1860,"No ""goodbye,"" no ""see ya later."" No nothing. You just left."
1861,"I don´t know much, but I know that."
1862," Mutters  This is a disaster, Sean."
1863,"I brought you in here because I wanted you to help me with the boy,  not to run him out."
1864, I know what l´m doing with the boy.
1865,I don´t care if you have a rapport with the boy !
1866,"I don´t care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense."
1867, But don´t you dare undermine what l´m trying to do here.
1868, Undermine ?
1869,This boy is at a fragile point right now.
1870,I do understand. He is at a fragile point. He´s got problems.
1871,"What problems does he have ? That he´s better off as a janitor, in jail ?"
1872,Better hanging out with a bunch of retarded gorillas ?
1873,Why do you think he does that ?
1874,You have any fuckin´ clue why ?
1875,He can handle the problems.
1876,He can handle the work.
1877,He obviously handled you.
1878,Listen to me.
1879,Why is he hiding ?
1880,Why doesn´t he trust anybody ?
1881,"Because the first thing that happened to him, he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most."
1882,Don´t give me that Freudian crap.
1883,"Why does he hang out with those retarded gorillas, as you call them ?"
1884,"Because any one of them, if he asked them to, would take a bat to your head."
1885, That´s called loyalty.
1886," Yeah, that´s very touching."
1887,Who´s he handling ?
1888,He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him.
1889,"It´s a defense mechanism, all right ?"
1890,"For 20 years, he´s been alone because of that."
1891,"If you push him right now, it´s gonna be the same thing all over again."
1892,I´m not gonna let that happen to him.
1893, Don´t you do that.
1894, What ?
1895,"Don´t infect him with the idea that it´s okay to quit, that it´s okay to be a failure."
1896,"Because it´s not okay, Sean !"
1897,"And if you´re angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been  I´m not angry at you."
1898," Oh, yes, you´re angry at me."
1899,"You resent me, but l´m not gonna apologize for any success l´ve had."
1900,You´re angry at me for doing what you could have done !
1901,"But ask yourself, Sean Ask yourself..."
1902,if you want Will to feel that way if you want him to feel like a failure ?
1903,You arrogant shit !
1904,"That´s why I don´t come to the goddamn reunions, ´cause I can´t stand that look in your eye."
1905," That condescending, embarrassed look."
1906," Oh, come on, Sean."
1907,You think l´m a failure.
1908,I know who I am.
1909,I´m proud of what I do. It was a conscious choice. I didn´t fuck up !
1910,And you and your cronies think l´m some sort of pity case.
1911,"You and your kissass chorus following you around going, ""The Field´s medal !"" Why are you still so fuckin´ afraid of failure ?"
1912,"It´s about my medal, isn´t it ?"
1913,"Oh, God, I could go home and get it for you. You can have it."
1914,"Shove the medal up your fuckin´ ass, all right ?"
1915,"´Cause I don´t give a shit about your medal, because I knew you before you were a mathematical god, when you were pimplefaced and homesick and didn´t know what side of the bed to piss on."
1916,"Yeah, you were smarter than me then and you´re smarter than me now."
1917,So don´t blame me for how your life turned out.
1918,I don´t blame you !
1919,lt´s not about you !
1920,You mathematical dick !
1921,lt´s about the boy !
1922,He´s a good kid ! And I won´t see you fuck him up like you´re tryin´ to fuck up me right now.
1923,I won´t see you make him feel like a failure too !
1924,He won´t be a failure !
1925,But if you push him ! lf you ride him !
1926,I am what I am today because I was pushed and because I learned to push myself.
1927,He´s not you !
1928,You get that !
1929,I can come back.
1930,"No, come in."
1931,"Uh, I was just leaving."
1932,A lot of that stuff goes back a long way between me and him.
1933,You know. Not about you.
1934,  Paper Rustles   What is that ?
1935,This is your file. I have to send it back to the judge for evaluation.
1936,"Oh. Hey, you´re not gonna fail me, are you ?"
1937,What´s it say ?
1938, Wanna read it ?
1939, Why ?
1940,"Have you had any, uh, experience with that ?"
1941,Twenty years of counseling.
1942,"Yeah, l´ve seen some pretty awful shit."
1943,"I mean, have you had any experience with that ?"
1944, Personally ?
1945, Yeah.
1946,"Yeah, I have."
1947,It sure ain´t good.
1948,My father was an alcoholic.
1949,Mean fuckin´ drunk.
1950,"He´d come home hammered, lookin´ to whale on somebody."
1951,So l´d provoke him so he wouldn´t go after my mother and little brother.
1952,Interesting nights when he wore his rings.
1953,"He used to just put a wrench, a stick and a belt on the table."
1954," Just say, ""Choose.""  Well, I gotta go with the belt there."
1955,I used to go with the wrench.
1956,Why the wrench ?
1957,"´Cause fuck him, that´s why."
1958, Your foster father ?
1959, Yeah.
1960,"So, uh, what is it, like, Will has an attachment disorder ?"
1961,Is it all that stuff ?
1962,Fear of abandonment ?
1963,Is that why I broke up with Skylar ?
1964, I didn´t know you had.
1965," Yeah, I did."
1966, You wanna talk about it ?
1967, No.
1968,"Hey, Will, I don´t know a lot."
1969,You see this ?
1970,All this shit ?
1971,It´s not your fault.
1972," WHISPERS  YEAH, I KNOW THAT."
1973,"Look at me, son."
