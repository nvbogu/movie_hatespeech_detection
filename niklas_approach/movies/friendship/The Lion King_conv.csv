1,"is it, my little friend?"
2,While some are born to feast...
3,"others spend their lives in the dark, begging for scraps."
4,The way I see it...
5,you and I are exactly the same.
6,We both want to find a way out.
7,The king approaches!
8,This is not a drill.
9,His Majesty has requested an audience.
10,"Upon his entrance, you will rise and genuflect."
11,Zazu...
12,you've made me lose my lunch.
13,You will answer to Mufasa for missing the ceremony this morning.
14,I answer to no one.
15,Scar? Scar. Scar.
16,"No, no."
17,Don't look at me like that.
18,"Are you hungry, Zazu?"
19,Perhaps we could have a bite together!
20,You can't eat me!
21,It is forbidden to eat a member of the king's court!
22,"Ow! No, please! Stop it!"
23,Scar!
24,"Well, look who's come down to mingle with the commoners."
25,Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
26,Was that today?
27,Must've slipped my mind.
28,Of course I meant no disrespect towards His Majesty or Sarabi.
29,"As you know, I have tremendous respect for the queen."
30,"As the king's brother, you should've been first in line."
31,I was first in line.
32,Or don't you remember?
33,"That is, until the precious prince arrived."
34,"Don't turn your back on me, Scar."
35,"Oh, no, Mufasa, perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me."
36,Is that a challenge?
37,I wouldn't dream of challenging you again.
38,A wise decision.
39,You are no match for His Royalness.
40,"Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share."
41,"But when it comes to brute strength, I'm afraid my big brother..."
42,will always rule.
43,"Not always, Scar."
44,"One day, it'll be my son who rules."
45,Simba will be your king.
46,Then long live the king.
47, What am I gonna do with him?
48," Oh, come on."
49,We both know he should've been expelled from the Pride Lands long ago.
50,"He's my brother, Zazu."
51,This is his home.
52,"As long as I am king, that will never change."
53,"Well, there's one in every family, sire."
54,I had a cousin who thought he was a woodpecker.
55,"He slammed his head into trees, and our beaks aren't built for it."
56,He was concussed regularly.
57,"Oh, you've gone."
58,"Uh, sire, coming back!"
59,Simba.
60,"Dad, you awake?"
61,"Dad, wake up!"
62,Dad!
63,"Dad, Dad, Dad!"
64,Your son's awake.
65,"Before sunrise, he's your son."
66,"Come on, Dad, let's go."
67,You said I could patrol with you today.
68,And today has started.
69,You promised!
70,You up?
71,Let's do this!
72,Let's do this.
73,"So, what's first?"
74,Give orders for the hunt?
75,Chase away evil intruders?
76,Dad! You're going the wrong way!
77,Dad?
78,I'm not supposed to go up here.
79,"Look, Simba."
80,Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
81,You rule all of that?
82,Yes.
83,But a king's time as ruler...
84,rises and falls like the sun.
85,"One day, Simba..."
86,the sun will set on my time here...
87,and will rise with you as the new king.
88,All of this will belong to me?
89,"It belongs to no one, but will be yours to protect."
90,A great responsibility.
91,Everything the light touches?
92,Those trees?
93,And the watering hole?
94,And that mountain?
95,And beyond those shadows?
96,"You must not go there, Simba."
97,But I thought a king could do whatever he wants.
98,Take any territory.
99,While others search for what they can take...
100,a true king searches for what he can give.
101,Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.
102,"As king, you need to understand that balance..."
103,and respect all the creatures...
104,from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
105,"But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?"
106,"Yes, Simba."
107,But let me explain.
108,"When we die, our bodies become the grass..."
109,and the antelope eat the grass...
110,and so we are all connected in the great circle of life.
111, Sire!
112," Morning, Zazu."
113,Do you have the morning report?
114,"Yes, sire."
115,Ten flamingos are taking a stand.
116,Two giraffe were caught necking.
117,The buzz from the bees...
118,is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
119,Ready for some fun?
120,The birds are tweeting at 4:00 in the morning.
121,"I'm like, ""Birds, we get it."" Stay low to the ground."
122,I got this.
123,"Check the wind, the shadows..."
124,and wait for the perfect moment to pounce.
125,"The cheetahs stole the baboons' dinner, and now the baboons are going ape."
126,"Of course, as I say, cheetahs never prosper."
127,That's what I say.
128,Do you get...
129,I'll say it again.
130,Cheetahs never...
131,Come on! It's the news!
132,That's very good!
133,Sire!
134,Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands.
135,They're on the hunt!
136,Where's Sarabi?
137,She's leading the charge.
138,"Zazu, take Simba home."
139,"Dad, let me come! I can help."
140,"No, son. You stay with the other cubs."
141,I am not a cub.
142,Come on.
143,Let's go home.
144,Here we are.
145,Now you go along and play with the other cubs.
146,Great.
147,If you wish to kill something...
148,you might want to stay downwind.
149,"I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar."
150,"Well, let's hope we're never attacked by a beetle."
151,"Go back to your den, Simba."
152,I don't babysit.
153,Babysit? I'm gonna be the king of Pride Rock.
154,My dad showed me the whole kingdom.
155,Said I'm going to rule it all.
156,Is that so?
157,Think about it.
158,"When I'm king, I'll have to give you orders."
159,Tell you what to do.
160,How weird is that?
161,You've no idea.
162,"So, your dad showed you the whole kingdom?"
163,Did he show you the shadows beyond the northern borders?
164,No. He said I can't go there. Ever.
165,And he's absolutely right.
166,An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.
167,An elephant graveyard?
168,Whoa.
169,"Oh, dear."
170,I've said too much.
171,Though I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...
172,you being king and all.
173,You've been there?
174,We've all been there.
175,And it's no place for a cub.
176,All those rotting bones...
177,and burning pools of oozing mud.
178,Rotting bones?
179,Oozing mud?
180,"Promise me you'll stay away, Simba."
181,"Now, you run along."
182,And remember...
183,it's our little secret...
184,Your Majesty.
185,Nala! Come on.
186,We have to go.
187, Where?
188, Watering hole.
189,"Simba, she's having her bath."
190,And it's time for yours.
191,"But, Mom..."
192,I can do it myself.
193,Hold still.
194,You're messing up my mane!
195,Come on.
196,Behind the ears.
197,"Come on, Mom!"
198,See? All clean. Can we go?
199,There's no hyenas.
200,You just chased them all off.
201,Just to the watering hole and no further.
202,And stay downwind.
203,And one more little thing.
204,Zazu will be going with you.
205,Zazu?
206,Zazu goes...
207,or you don't.
208,Come along. Keep up.
209,Let's move in a unit.
210,"Okay, buddy system."
211,"So, where are we really going?"
212,How did you know?
213,You hate the water.
214,"I heard about this place, Nala."
215,"The most incredible, amazing..."
216,Just tell me where.
217,An elephant graveyard.
218,Whoa. How far is it?
219,Not far.
220,Just to the shadows.
221,"But don't worry, everyone's been there."
222,We've never been that far before.
223,What if we get lost?
224,"Relax, Nala."
225,I patrolled the entire kingdom this morning with my dad.
226,There's nothing to worry about.
227,"Well, there is one thing."
228,We have an imminent threat.
229,Something is approaching.
230,"Oh, wait, scratch that."
231,That's my own shadow.
232,How we getting rid of the dodo?
233,"Trust me, I got this."
234,Follow me to freedom.
235,"Oh, how lovely it is..."
236,to see the future king with his future queen.
237,I could just molt.
238,"What do you mean, ""future queen""?"
239,"Well, one day the two of you will be betrothed."
240,Intended. Affianced.
241,"Simba, you speak bird?"
242,Married!
243,Come on. One day you will be married.
244,To each other.
245, Ugh!
246, Ew!
247,"Mmmmmm. That's not gonna happen, Zazu."
248,Never ever.
249,Nala and I are friends.
250,"And besides, she's afraid of rhinos!"
251,And he's never eaten an impala.
252,I've tried it once.
253,"We are never getting married, Zazu."
254,A monarch who ignores tradition?
255,"With an attitude like that, I'm afraid you'll be a pretty pathetic king."
256,"Well, I'm not letting anyone tell me where to go, what to do..."
257,and even who to marry.
258,There will never be a king like me.
259,"Simba, you can't escape your destiny."
260,Just watch.
261,"âª I'm gonna be a mighty king âª So enemies beware âª Well, I've never seen a king of beasts âª With quite so little hair âª I'm gonna be the main event Like no king was before âª I'm brushing up on looking down âª Working on my roar âª Thus far a rather uninspiring thing âª Oh, I just can't wait to be king You have rather a long way to go, young master."
262,If you think...
263,"âª No one saying ""do this"" Now, when I said that..."
264,"âª No one saying ""be there"" What I meant was..."
265,"âª No one saying ""stop that"" âª No one saying ""see here"" Now see here!"
266,"âª Free to run around all day Well, that's definitely out."
267,"âª Free to do it all my way âª I think it's time that you and I âª Arranged a hearttoheart âª Kings don't need advice âª From little hornbills for a start âª If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out âª Out of service Out of Africa âª I wouldn't hang about âª This child is getting wildly out of wing Simba!"
268,"âª Oh, I just can't wait to be king âª Simba!"
269,"I can't see you, Simba."
270,You must be in my sight at all times.
271,I've lost him!
272,I know what you're doing!
273,"Where are you going, Simba?"
274,Come on!
275,"You can't hide from me, Simba."
276,It is my sworn duty to keep you safe.
277,You listen to me right now.
278,"I'm sorry to flutter about in your face, have you seen..."
279,He's a little lion.
280,"He's small, but he's cute."
281,âª Everybody look left âª Everybody look right âª Everywhere you look I'm âª Standing in the spotlight Not yet.
282,âª Let every creature go for broke and sing âª Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing I see you down there!
283,I see you down there!
284,"âª It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling âª Oh, I just can't wait to be king Simba!"
285,"âª He just can't wait to be king âª Oh, I just can't wait âª Just can't wait âª To be king âª I've lost him!"
286,Mufasa's gonna have my feathers.
287,This is not good!
288,"Simba, we really lost him."
289,I know what you're thinking.
290,"""The future king is a genius."" You can't be serious."
291,You would've never gotten away without your queen.
292,Aren't you forgetting something?
293,There is no queen.
294,You could say that again.
295,I'd rather marry an aardvark.
296,Good luck finding one that will say yes.
297,Good luck getting out of here without a bruising.
298,Give it your best shot.
299,Pinned ya!
300,You owe me an apology.
301,Never!
302,Pinned ya. Again.
303,"Nala, stop!"
304,What is that?
305,"You're not gonna trick me, Simba."
306,I know that there's nothing...
307,This must be it.
308,Come on!
309,"Simba, we're way beyond the Pride Lands."
310,"We found it, Nala."
311,You know what this means?
312,It means we can go home.
313,It means they won't treat us like cubs anymore.
314,"Simba, get down!"
315,It could be dangerous.
316,Danger?
317,I laugh in the face of danger.
318,Cool!
319,"You hear that, Nala?"
320,"Simba, come on!"
321,You've proved how brave you are.
322,"Now the sun is going down, I'm not just gonna sit here and..."
323,"Well, look at this."
324,We weren't expecting guests today.
325,Would you two cubs...
326,like to stay for dinner?
327,"Yeah, stay for dinner."
328,'Cause you look like a midnight snack!
329,Can you just give me a little bit of space?
330,I'm helping.
331,We have talked about this before.
332,I come in alone.
333,I'm the lead distraction so everyone can circle.
334,"Okay, okay. Sorry."
335,Don't be sorry.
336,Just do it.
337,"Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for."
338,"What an unexpected treat, to eat the son of a king."
339,"Wait a second, the king?"
340,As in youknowwho?
341,Who rules youknowwhere?
342,Mufasa does not rule me!
343,You can't do anything to me!
344,'Cause I'm the future king!
345,He's telling me what to do.
346,His father's strength flickering inside.
347,I wonder...
348,how all that bravery will taste.
349,"Let them go, Shenzi!"
350,"They made a mistake, a horrible mistake!"
351,"But if you do this, you will start a war with Mufasa!"
352,Hyenas and lions have been at war since the beginning of time.
353,But Mufasa's bloodline will end here!
354,Run!
355,Don't let them get away!
356,Come on!
357,Did you hear that?
358,The future king!
359,"Oh, don't hurt me!"
360,Do it again!
361,If you ever come near my son again...
362,"No, Mufasa. Never."
363,Never again.
364,"You've been warned, Shenzi."
365,I thought you were very brave.
366,Zazu?
367,Take Nala back to Pride Rock.
368,"Yes, sire."
369,"Don't be too hard on him, sire."
370,"I remember a cub, a certain headstrong cub..."
371,who was always getting into scrapes.
372,"And he achieved some prominence, did he not, sire?"
373,I have to teach my son a lesson.
374,"Nala, come along."
375,Simba?
376,You deliberately disobeyed me.
377,I know.
378,You could have been killed.
379,"And what's worse, you put Nala in danger."
380,Do you understand what's at stake?
381,You jeopardized the future of our pride.
382,I just wanted to show you I could do it.
383,That I could be brave like you.
384,"I'm only brave when I have to be, when there's no other choice."
385,But you're not scared of anything.
386,I was today.
387,You were?
388,Yes. I thought I might lose you.
389,"I guess even kings get scared, huh?"
390,More than you could ever know.
391, But guess what?
392, What?
393,I think those hyenas were even scareder.
394,That's 'cause nobody messes with your dad.
395,Come here.
396, Dad?
397, Uhhuh?
398,"We're pals, right?"
399,Right.
400,And we'll always be together...
401,right?
402,"Simba, let me tell you something my father told me."
403,Look at the stars.
404,The great kings of the past...
405,look down on us from those stars.
406, Really?
407, Yes.
408,So whenever you feel alone...
409,just remember that those kings...
410,will always be up there to guide you.
411,And so will I.
412,"But I can't see them, Dad."
413,"Keep looking, son."
414,Keep looking.
415,Mufasa is strong.
416,"Like, way stronger than us."
417, Please give me some space.
418, What?
419,You could lay anywhere in this cave.
420, Where do you want me to...
421, I need some personal space.
422, Okay?
423, Okay.
424,Not to take anything away from you. You were great.
425,But he is...
426,"See, now I know you're doing this on purpose."
427,"Very brave, too."
428,"Tough, good energy."
429,Now you're just being spiteful.
430,Good posture.
431,Next time I see Mufasa...
432,I'm gonna teach him a lesson he will never forget.
433,"Well, you're in luck!"
434,He's right behind ya.
435,Mufasa?
436,That's not the king.
437,You fools have stripped your land of every living thing.
438,And yet I send two little cubs your way...
439,and they come back alive.
440,I guess we'll have to eat you instead.
441,Why eat one meal...
442,when you can be feasting the rest of your lives?
443,What could you possibly offer us?
444,A place where you can fill your bellies.
445,Where everything the light touches is yours for the kill.
446,The Pride Lands are not yours to give.
447,The king controls those hunting grounds.
448,That's why we're going to kill him.
449,Mufasa has always shown too much restraint...
450,when it comes to hunting.
451,When I am king...
452,the mighty will be free to take whatever they want.
453,Because a hyena's belly is never full.
454,Mufasa's far too powerful to challenge.
455,"âª Mufasa is yesterday's message âª A clappedout, distracted regime âª Whose failings undoubtedly presage âª The need for a dif'rent dream âª Yes, leonine times are achanging âª Which means that hyenas must too âª My vision is clear and wideranging âª And even encompasses you âª So prepare for the coup of the century âª Prepare for the murkiest scam âª Meticulous planning âª Tenacity spanning âª Decades of denial Is simply why I'll âª Be king Undisputed âª Respected Saluted âª And seen for the wonder I am âª Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared âª Be prepared  âª Be prepared  âª Be prepared âª Be prepared Be prepared  âª Be prepared  âª Be prepared âª Be prepared Be prepared âª Be prepared âª Be prepared âª Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared âª Be prepared âª My dad was pretty upset with me."
456,"That's why we're here, Simba."
457,I think I know a way for you to make it up to him.
458,A gift that will make him forget it ever happened.
459,But he's the king.
460,What could I give him?
461,Your roar.
462,My roar?
463,Yes!
464,Did you hear that?
465,This gorge is where all lions come to find their roar.
466,All lions?
467,Even my dad?
468,Even Mufasa came here when he was your age.
469,Refused to leave...
470,until his roar could be heard above the rim.
471,All the way up there?
472,That's when you know you've found it.
473,With a little practice...
474,you'll never be called a cub again.
475,Watch this.
476,"You'll get it, Simba."
477,Just takes time.
478,I'll check on you later.
479,"Dad will be so proud, won't he?"
480,It's a gift he'll never forget.
481,Mufasa! Quick!
482,Stampede in the gorge!
483,Simba's down there!
484,Simba?
485,I'll find him.
486,Zazu!
487,Hold on!
488,Help is coming!
489,There he is!
490,On that tree!
491,"I'm coming, Simba!"
492,Hold on!
493,"I'll help them, Zazu!"
494,You get the pride!
495,Go!
496,Dad!
497,Simba!
498,"Come to me, son."
499,Jump!
500,Dad!
501,Scar!
502,Help me.
503,Long live the king!
504,No!
505,Dad?
506,Dad?
507,Dad?
508,Dad?
509,"Come on, wake up."
510,Help! Somebody help!
511,Simba!
512,What have you done?
513,It was a stampede.
514,He tried to save me.
515,It was an accident.
516,I didn't mean for it to...
517,Of course you didn't.
518,No one ever means for these things to happen.
519,But the king is dead...
520,and if it weren't for you...
521,he'd still be alive.
522,Your father had such hopes for you...
523,gave you so many chances.
524,And this is how you repay him.
525,I didn't know.
526,I didn't know.
527,"Oh, what will your mother think?"
528,A son who causes his father's death.
529,A boy who kills a king.
530,What am I gonna do?
531,Run.
532,"Run away, Simba."
533,Run away and never return!
534,Kill him.
535,Go down and make sure he's dead.
536,Seriously?
537,"Oh, I'm sorry."
538,That's a good distance right there.
539,Okay.
540,No little cub could survive that fall.
541,"Listen, we're gonna tell her..."
542,we went down there and we ate him.
543,"Uhhuh. That's perfect, 'cause I am starving!"
544,We're not gonna eat him.
545,Simba is dead.
546,That's all she ever has to know.
547,Works for me.
548,Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
549,The greatest leader the pride has ever known.
550,To lose a brother...
551,"such a deep, personal loss."
552,"And little Simba, who had barely begun to live."
553,A cub whose blood held our future.
554,It's almost too much to endure.
555,I only wish I had gotten to the gorge in time...
556,been there to save them.
557,And so it is with a heavy heart...
558,that I must assume the throne.
559,Mufasa and Simba are gone...
560,which means I am your king.
561,But I must admit...
562,I cannot bear this burden alone.
563,And I will need some help...
564,to ensure the safety of the pride.
565,"Nala, stay close."
566,"And so, from the ashes of this tragedy..."
567,we shall welcome the dawning of a new era.
568,A great...
569,and glorious future!
570,"Oh, dear."
571,I missed 'em!
572,I'm gonna get one of those vultures one day.
573,I'm gonna get one!
574,I don't know why it's so important to you.
575,I just feel like it would make me feel better.
576,"Oh, no."
577,It's a little lion!
578, That is not a lion.
579," Well then, go check it out."
580, What is it?
581," That is not a lion, it's a furry bird!"
582,It looks like a lion!
583,That's not a lion. Let me get a closer look. Excuse me.
584,"All right, let me see what we're dealing with here."
585,It's a lion!
586," Run for your life, Pumbaa!"
587," Wait! Hey, Timon."
588," Wait, Timon, wait!"
589, It's a little lion!
590,It gets bigger.
591,Can we keep him?
592,Can we please keep him?
593,"Oh, oh, okay. I promise I'll walk him every day!"
594,"If he makes a little mess, I'll clean it up."
595,You'll be his little mess!
596,He's gonna eat you and then use my body as a toothpick!
597,"But one day, when he's big and strong, he'll be on our side!"
598,I've got it. What if he's on our side?
599,Hear me out!
600,Having a ferocious lion around might not be such a bad idea!
601,"Well then, can we keep him?"
602,"Yes, of course we can keep him!"
603,"My God, who is the brains of this operation?"
604,âª We're gonna name him Fred! âª Who are you?
605,"Uh, we're the guys who saved your life."
606,Yes.
607,Risked everything.
608,Fought off angry vultures!
609,Hordes of them. Flocks.
610,I'm Pumbaa.
611, This is Timon.
612, Did I mention that we saved your life?
613,It doesn't matter.
614,Whoa. How bleak is that?
615,It doesn't even matter?
616,"Like I don't have enough that I'm dealing with, right?"
617,Now his problems are my problems?
618,But we can help him.
619,We're in a position to help him.
620,"So, how are you, in as few words as possible?"
621,I did something terrible.
622,I don't wanna talk about it.
623,"Look, kid, we've all made mistakes."
624,"Uh, there must be something we can do, right?"
625,Not unless you can change the past.
626,"Well, you know, that's a lot to ask..."
627,That's pretty hard.
628,That's a biggie.
629,...if I'm being honest.
630,"I mean, change the past?"
631,It already happened.
632,"Yeah, so you can't change that."
633,But you know what you can change?
634,The future.
635,That's our specialty.
636,Kind of our thing.
637,How can you change something that hasn't happened?
638,"Well, to change the future, you gotta put your past behind you."
639,Way behind.
640,"Look, kid, bad things happen and you can't do anything about it, right?"
641,Right.
642,Wrong! When the world turns its back on you...
643,you turn your back on the world!
644,And only embrace what's next!
645,"And turn the ""what"" into ""so what?"" Well, that's not what I was taught."
646,"Well, then maybe you need a new lesson."
647,"Repeat after me, kid."
648,Hakuna matata.
649, What?
650, Hakuna matata.
651,Hakuna matata.
652,Most people get a bigger reaction when we say it the first...
653,"Okay, well anyway."
654,Hakuna matata.
655,Some people start clapping immediately.
656,"It means ""no worries."" One and a..."
657,I do the counting here.
658, I wanna count!
659, Why don't we count together?
660," Okay, that's a good idea."
661, All right.
662,One and a two and a...

669, Boom!
670,Those two words will solve all your problems.
671,Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.
672,"âª Why, when he was a young warthog âª When I was a young warthog  How are you feeling?"
673, It's an emotional story.
674,âª He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal âª He could clear the savannah after every meal âª I'm a sensitive soul âª Although I seem thickskinned âª And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind I was always here for you and I resent that.
675," âª And, oh, the shame  âª Yes, he was ashamed âª I thought of changing my name I mean, to what, ""Brad""?"
676,âª And I got downhearted âª Ev'ry time that I farted Are you gonna stop me?
677,"No, I'm not! You disgust me!"

679,You live here?
680,"Well, we live wherever we want."
681,We do as we please.
682,It's beautiful.
683,"Yeah, it's really nice, huh?"
684,"Everyone, this is Simba."
685,"That, my friend, is a lion."
686,What about food?
687,Have you thought about feeding that thing?
688,"Yeah, I'm starved!"
689,I could eat a whole zebra.
690,Here we go.
691,"Uh, no, no, no, kid, we're fresh out of zebra."
692,Any antelope?
693, Uhoh.
694," No, listen, kid..."
695,"if you want to live with us, you have to eat like us."
696,"And most importantly, not eat us!"
697,This looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub!
698, Yeah!
699, It's perfect!
700,"Step aside, fellas!"
701,Ugh. What's that?
702,Ooh. Too chewy.
703,This one's got some nuttiness!
704,Mmm. Now that's what I call umami!
705,"Slimy, yet satisfying."
706,Mmm. Extra crunchy.
707, They're local.
708," Yeah. Oh, are they?"
709,They're from right there.
710,"I'm telling ya, kid, this is the great life."
711,No rules.
712,No responsibilities.
713,Ooh! The little creamfilled kind.
714,I love these!
715, Those are good.
716, I love these.
717,Those are the best.
718,Can I have the head?
719,"Well, kid?"
720,"Oh, well."
721,Hakuna matata.
722,Slimy...
723,yet satisfying.
724, That's it!
725, We didn't lie!
726,Egg sac!

729,"Oh, no, I think we did it. Yeah."
730,I think we got this one.
731,"But we're just getting in the groove, guys."
732,"No, let's leave 'em wanting more."
733,"Yeah, you've grown Meanwhile I look exactly the same."
734,âª It means no worries âª Will you tell him to stop?
735,But you insisted we sing the song.
736,I insisted?
737,You started singing it!
738,"Well, it's our signature song..."
739,we shouldn't be sharing it with everyone.
740,Look at that sunset.
741,"But it's our signature song, so we have to."
742,"Look, just tell him to stop."
743,"âª It means no worries âª Oh, now he's riffing, Pumbaa."
744,This is a nightmare.
745,It actually is becoming better and better.
746,Nala.
747,Come.
748,Sit with us.
749,"Zazu, where have you been?"
750,"I'm sorry, Nala."
751,I came as soon as I could.
752,"The morning report, Zazu."
753,"Your Majesty, the Pride Lands are in imminent danger."
754,The hyenas are chasing off the last of the herds.
755,The bird's back!
756,Get him!
757,"Don't come here again, unless you want to be eaten!"
758,"We have to do something, Sarabi. We have to fight!"
759,Nala. Scar is the king.
760,But you are our queen!
761,We should leave before it's too late!
762,We must all stay together and protect the Pride Lands.
763,This is our home.
764,We must never abandon it.
765,This isn't the home I remember.
766,"Our time will come, Nala."
767,Be patient.
768,Sarabi.
769,The king wishes to see you.
770,Don't go.
771,I'm not afraid of him.
772,"Won't you join me, Sarabi?"
773,There's plenty to go around.
774,"You're overhunting, Scar."
775,I've simply perfected the kill.
776,With the help of my army.
777,You're killing everything.
778,Don't you see? There is nobody to challenge me.
779,We can finally take whatever we want.
780,We?
781,Long ago you chose Mufasa over me.
782,But now there is a new king.
783,So stop being so selfish.
784,You are the selfish one.
785,The other lions look to you.
786,As long as you resist they will reject me.
787,"Take your place by my side, and we will feast together."
788,I will never be your queen!
789,Then from now on...
790,the lions will eat after the hyenas.
791,And they don't leave much behind.
792,"Just what do you think you are doing, young lady?"
793,"Go away, Zazu."
794,I'm going to find help.
795,I will very much not go away.
796,I am sworn to protect you and must order you back to bed.
797,I don't need protecting anymore.
798,"Uh, Scar!"
799,"Uh, wonderful to see you."
800,"Uh, sorry to drop in like this!"
801,Ah!
802,Have I ever told you about my brother who thought he was a woodpecker?
803,Nala...
804,"Oh, I'm gonna get ya!"
805,I'm gonna get ya!
806,"Oh, I got ya!"
807,Oh.
808,Simba! It's you!
809,Did you see that?
810,"Man, that butterfly was right there!"
811,I almost had him.
812,I thought it was a lion.
813,"You know, the other kind of lion."
814,"You know, a real lion?"
815,"I mean, not that you're not a real lion."
816,"But you know, the kind that eats..."
817,I'm gonna go.
818,"Hey, where you going?"
819,You wanna get some grubs?
820,What's up with that guy?
821,"Um, Simba..."
822,How can I say this?
823, He's prey.
824, Yeah.
825,And he is never gonna want to frolic with a carnivore.
826,No. You two will never frolic.
827,Why not?
828,"You see, in nature there's a delicate balance."
829,"Oh, yeah. The circle of life."
830,I know that.
831, No.
832," No, no, no."
833,"I don't know where you're getting ""circle"" from."
834,"No, yeah."
835,There's no circle of life.
836," No, it's no circle."
837," No, not at all."
838," In fact, it's the opposite."
839, Yeah.
840, It's a line.
841, Yeah.
842,It's a meaningless line of indifference.
843,And we're all just running towards the end of the line.
844,"And then one day we'll reach the end, and that'll be it."
845, That's it.
846, Line over!
847, Nothing.
848, Nada.
849,And you can really just kinda...
850,do your own thing and fend for yourself...
851,'cause your line doesn't affect anyone else's lines.
852,You're alive and then you're not. Like this guy.
853,Mmm.
854,You sure it's not a circle?
855,That we're all connected?
856,A circle would mean we're all this.
857,That would mean what I do affects him...
858,"affects that thing, affects that thing."
859,Yeah. No.
860,That's not how it goes.
861,Which would make doing whatever we wanted not that cool.
862,Let me simplify this for you.
863, Life is meaningless.
864, Yes.
865,That's why you just gotta look out for yourself.
866,"That's why you do you, Simba."
867,"Yeah, Simba, for the first time..."
868,we're entrusting you to make a plan for us today.
869,This is important.
870,Think about all you've been taught.
871,What do you wanna do?
872,Absolutely nothing.
873,Whoohoo!
874, Exactly! He gets it!
875,Jackpot!
876,Out of my way!
877,Out of my way!
878, Crunchy!
879, All right! Time to eat!
880,Oh.
881,Hello!
882,"Nice one, Simba."
883,"Oh, thanks."
884,Must've been the termites.
885,Or the crickets.
886,And you wonder why I prefer to sleep underground.
887,"Hey, Timon."
888,Do you ever look up there and wonder what those sparkly dots are?
889,"Oh, Pumbaa."
890,I don't wonder. I know.
891,Really?
892,What are they?
893,They're fireflies.
894,"Fireflies that got stuck on that big, bluishblack thing."
895,Oh.
896,I guess that makes sense.
897,I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
898,"Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything always gas with you?"
899,I know.
900," What do you think, Simba?"
901, Yeah.
902,"Oh, I don't know."
903,But somebody once told me...
904,the great kings of the past are up there...
905,and they're all watching over us.
906,That's a good one!
907,That's insane!
908,That's insane!
909,Royal dead guys watching over us!
910,"Well, I hope they don't fall out of the sky!"
911,"Hang on, Your Majesty!"
912,Don't let go!
913,"Oh, that would be a mess."
914,"Oh, man!"
915,"I mean, Simba, think about it."
916,Why would a bunch of kings be looking out for us?
917,We're outcasts.
918,Royal warthogs!
919,I can't! I can't!
920,I can't!
921,I actually can't.
922,I can't.
923,"No, you can."
924,I can't.
925,Yeah. Yeah.
926,Yeah.
927,That's stupid.
928,I'm gonna go get some grubs or something.
929,What did you say to him?
930,I don't know.
931,"As you were saying it, I thought, ""This won't end well."" You just start laughing."
932,You laughed too.
933,I did not.
934,I would never.
935,"Man, I blew it."
936,Simba.
937,Simba is alive!
938,"âª Aweemaweh Aweemaweh âª Aweemaweh Aweemaweh âª Wee âª Uh wee bum bum buhweh âª Wee âª Uh wee bum bum buhweh âª In the jungle, the mighty jungle âª The lion sleeps tonight âª In the jungle, the quiet jungle âª The lion sleeps tonight âª Wee âª Uh wee bum bum buhweh âª Wee âª Uh wee bum bum buhweh âª Near the village, the peaceful village âª The lion sleeps tonight âª Near the village, the quiet village âª The lion sleeps tonight âª Wee âª Uh wee bum bum buhweh âª Wee âª Wee âª Pumbaa!"
939,Run for your life!
940,"Run, Pumbaa, run!"
941,"Timon, help!"
942,Pumbaa!
943,Pumbaa?
944,I'm gonna die!
945,"I'm coming, Pumbaa!"
946,Hang in there!
947,Move! Move! Move!
948,No!
949,"Oh, no! Oh, no!"
950,No!
951,Nala?
952,Simba?
953,Is that really you?
954,Yeah.
955,"It's me, Simba!"
956,"Nala, what're you doing?"
957,"Oh, my..."
958,I don't believe it!
959,Look at you!
960,Pumbaa...
961,I don't think you're getting eaten.
962,"Oh, where have you been?"
963,I thought you were dead!
964,You thought he was dead.
965,I thought I was dead!
966,I thought you were gonna eat me.
967,What fun!
968,"I'm so sorry, before we move on, how do you two know each other?"
969,"Timon, Pumbaa..."
970,"I want you to meet my best friend, Nala."
971,Best friend?
972,"Well, that hurts."
973,"Nala, you're gonna love it here!"
974,This place is amazing.
975,It's everything you could ever want.
976,"Simba, we need to leave."
977,Scar has taken over with the hyenas.
978,You have to take your place as king.
979,King? Simba?
980,We kneel before you as loyal servants.
981,"Pumbaa, relax."
982,She's wrong.
983,"Lady, you've got your lions crossed."
984,Nice.
985,"Seeing you again, you don't know what this will mean to everyone."
986,What this means to me.
987,You have to come home.
988,This is my home.
989,Please stay.
990,This place is incredible.
991,I know you'll love it.
992,I can't.
993,Come on!
994,At least let me show you around.
995,Where are you going?
996,"Simba, it's so beautiful."
997,âª I can see what's happening I can't. What?
998,"âª And they don't have a clue Who's ""they""?"
999,"âª They'll fall in love And here's the bottom line âª Our trio's down to two Oh, I get it."
1000,âª The sweet caress of twilight Yeah.
1001,âª There's magic ev'rywhere It's ev'rywhere.
1002,âª And with all this romantic atmosphere âª Disaster's in the air âª Can you feel âª The love tonight?
1003,âª The peace the evening brings âª The world for once in perfect harmony âª With all its living things âª So many things to tell her âª But how to make her see The truth about my past?
1004,"âª Impossible âª She'd turn away from me âª He's holding back, he's hiding âª But what, I can't decide âª Why won't he be the king I know he is?"
1005,âª The king I see inside?
1006,âª Can you feel the love tonight?
1007,âª The peace the evening brings âª The world for once in perfect harmony âª With all its living things âª Can you feel the love tonight?
1008,"âª You needn't look too far âª Stealing through the night's uncertainties âª Love is where they are âª And if he falls in love tonight âª It can be assumed âª His carefree days with us are history âª In short, our pal is doomed âª I told you."
1009,Isn't it great here?
1010,"You know, maybe it could be like this forever."
1011,It's amazing.
1012,But there's something I don't understand.
1013,If you've been alive all this time...
1014,why haven't you come home?
1015,We've really needed you.
1016,"They're fine, all right?"
1017,Nobody needs me.
1018,You're the king.
1019,"Nala, Scar is the king."
1020,"Simba, he's decimated the Pride Lands."
1021,"There's no food, no water..."
1022,There's nothing I can do.
1023,What about your mother?
1024,This is your responsibility.
1025,You need to challenge Scar.
1026,I can't go back. Ever.
1027,Why?
1028,Because of what happened at the gorge?
1029,Scar told us that...
1030,You wouldn't understand!
1031,None of it matters. Okay?
1032,Hakuna matata.
1033,What?
1034,"It's something I learned out here, okay?"
1035,"You see, sometimes bad things happen, and there's nothing you can do about it."
1036,"So, why worry?"
1037,Why worry?
1038,What happened to you?
1039,You're not the Simba I remember.
1040,And I never will be.
1041,Are you satisfied?
1042,"No, I'm disappointed."
1043,"You know, now you're starting to sound like my father."
1044,Good. I'm glad one of us does.
1045,You have no idea what I've been through!
1046,I came here looking for help.
1047,I guess I made a mistake.
1048,"Goodbye, Simba."
1049,"""Disappointed""?"
1050,She wants me to go home?
1051,I am home.
1052,"""Best friend""?"
1053,I don't need best friends.
1054,I don't need anybody.
1055,Never did.
1056,Go away.
1057,Going away will not answer the question.
1058,What question?
1059,Who are you?
1060,I know exactly who I am.
1061,"The question is, who are you?"
1062,I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
1063,All right?
1064,Everybody is somebody.
1065,Even a nobody.
1066,"Yeah, I think you're confused."
1067,I am confused?
1068,You don't even know who you are.
1069,Oh. And I suppose you do?
1070,I held the son of Mufasa.
1071,You knew my father?
1072,Correction.
1073,I know your father.
1074,He died a long time ago.
1075,He's alive!
1076,And I can take you to him.
1077,Follow me.
1078,I will show you!
1079,"Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!"
1080,If you can keep up!
1081,Wait!
1082,Follow me!
1083,"Quickly, quickly!"
1084,Come through!
1085,Hey! Slow down!
1086,"Hey, you better hurry."
1087,Hold on.
1088,"I'm coming, I'm coming."
1089,Come.
1090,Your father is waiting.
1091,Do you see him?
1092,I don't see anything.
1093,Look closer.
1094,You see?
1095,He lives in you.
1096,Simba.
1097,Dad?
1098,Simba.
1099,You must take your place in the circle of life.
1100,I can't.
1101,You must remember who you are.
1102,The one true king.
1103,I'm sorry.
1104,I don't know how to be like you.
1105,"As king, I was most proud of one thing."
1106,Having you as my son.
1107,That was a long time ago.
1108,"No, Simba. That is forever."
1109,Please.
1110,Don't leave me again.
1111,I never left you.
1112,And never will.
1113,Remember who you are.
1114,Remember.
1115,"And so, I ask again."
1116,Who are you?
1117,I am Simba.
1118,Son of Mufasa.
1119,âª Yeah Spirit âª Watch the heavens open âª Yeah âª Spirit âª Can you hear it calling?
1120,âª Yeah Simba?
1121,Come on!
1122,What are you waiting for?
1123,Let's go home!
1124,"âª Spirit âª Watch the heavens open, open âª Yeah âª Your destiny is coming close âª Stand up and fight âª So, go in to a faroff land âª And be one with the great I am âª I didn't wanna believe you."
1125,"So, what are you gonna do?"
1126,My father once told me to protect everything the light touches.
1127,"If I don't fight for it, who will?"
1128,I will.
1129,It's going to be dangerous.
1130,Danger? Ha!
1131,I laugh in the face of danger.
1132,It can't be!
1133,"Hello, Zazu."
1134,Your Majesty.
1135,Welcome home.
1136,We're here!
1137,"Oh, everyone, calm down."
1138,We're here.
1139,The backup has arrived!
1140,What are you guys doing here?
1141," Um, we were not worried!"
1142," Um... No, not worried."
1143, 'Cause no worries.
1144, Nope. Hakuna matata.
1145,"We were concerned, because..."
1146,"Because, you know..."
1147,You're our friend.
1148,What about the meaningless line of indifference?
1149,"Well, we were thinking..."
1150, maybe it curves a little bit.
1151, That's a good point.
1152,"I mean, Simba, look, I'm happy to admit when Pumbaa's wrong..."
1153,and this is one of those instances.
1154,What? That wasn't my thing.
1155,You told me about the line.
1156,"Wait, hold on."
1157,"Now, this is the place you're fighting for?"
1158,"Yes, Timon."
1159,This is my home.
1160,Is it behind that terrifying rock?
1161,Talk about your fixerupper.
1162,"I like what you've done with it, although a bit heavy on the carcass."
1163,"Hey, hey, look."
1164,A bird.
1165,"Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu."
1166,"Oh, wow!"
1167,It's a puffin.
1168,Charming.
1169,"Simba, we are with you until the end."
1170,"We are at your service, my liege!"
1171,Follow me.
1172,Hyenas everywhere.
1173,I hope it's a quick death.
1174,"You know, just not a lot of chewing."
1175,What's your plan for getting us past the slobbering guards?
1176,Live bait.
1177,That's a great idea.
1178,Those guys could never resist fresh meat.
1179,"So all we need to do is find something that's, like, big..."
1180,"and plump, and juicy."
1181,Maybe like a gnu?
1182,Why is everyone looking at me?
1183,It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure...
1184,that we proudly present...
1185,your dinner.
1186,"âª Be our guest âª It's working, Pumbaa!"
1187,My old friend.
1188,"Sarabi, why put yourself through this?"
1189,All you have to do is be my queen.
1190,You're suffering for what?
1191,The memory of a life you once knew?
1192,A king you once loved?
1193,I tried to make you understand what a true king can be.
1194,"Scar, a true king's power is his compassion."
1195,I am ten times the king Mufasa was!
1196,You are nothing compared to Mufasa!
1197,Mufasa?
1198,It can't be.
1199,Get away from my mother.
1200,Simba.
1201,You're alive?
1202,How can that be?
1203,"I'm here, Mother."
1204,I'm home.
1205,Simba...
1206,I'm so happy to see you.
1207,Alive.
1208,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
1209,I can give you more than one.
1210,You see...
1211,they think I'm king.
1212,"Well, we don't."
1213,"Your reign is over, Scar."
1214,Simba is the rightful king!
1215,"If you wanna get him, you have to get through us."
1216,"Are you with me, lions?"
1217,"The choice is yours, Scar."
1218,Step down or fight.
1219,Must this all end in violence?
1220,I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
1221,To feel the shame of knowing...
1222,I took the life of someone I love.
1223,I put all that behind me.
1224,But have they put it behind them?
1225,Do your faithful subjects know what you've done?
1226,What is he talking about?
1227,So you haven't told them your little secret?
1228,"Well, Simba..."
1229,now's your chance to confess.
1230,Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death.
1231,It was me.
1232,It's not true.
1233,Tell me it's not true.
1234,It's true. I'm sorry.
1235,He admits it.
1236,Murderer!
1237,"No, no."
1238,It was an accident.
1239,If it weren't for you the king would be alive.
1240,It's your fault he's dead!
1241,Do you deny it?
1242,I'm not a murderer.
1243,We should believe a son who takes the life of a father?
1244,We should believe a son who takes the life of a king?
1245,A son who abandons his mother?
1246,No. I'm...
1247,You're what? Say it!
1248,Are you the king?
1249,"No. No, I'm..."
1250, Are you the king?
1251," No, I'm..."
1252, You're what? Say it!
1253, I'm...
1254,I'm nothing.
1255,Then bow to your king!
1256,Simba!
1257,This looks familiar.
1258,Where have I seen this before?
1259,"Oh, yes, I remember."
1260,This is the way Mufasa looked before he died.
1261,I looked down...
1262,saw the fear in his eyes.
1263,And here's my little secret.
1264,I killed Mufasa.
1265,No!
1266,My father!
1267,Your own brother!
1268,How could you?
1269,First he kills Mufasa...
1270,and now he wants to kill me!
1271,You killed him!
1272,Tell them the truth!
1273,Don't believe his lies!
1274,Scar...
1275,you told us you didn't get to the gorge in time.
1276,That's true!
1277,Then how did you see the look in Mufasa's eyes?
1278,Murderer!
1279,Kill them all!
1280,"Lions, attack!"
1281,Simba!
1282,"Pumbaa, I think we lost them."
1283,That was terrifying.
1284,Do you hear a low growl?
1285,Looks like we'll be having pig for dinner.
1286,Plump and chubby.
1287,Chubby?
1288,Did he just call me chubby?
1289,Uhoh.
1290,"It sounded a lot like he just said ""chubby""."
1291,Which would be a mistake because...
1292,I will not be made to feel ashamed of who I am!
1293,"Oh, boy."
1294,I may run from hyenas...
1295,but I will always fight a bully!
1296," You feel better, Pumbaa?"
1297, I do.
1298,You got that out of your system?
1299,I did.
1300,"Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for."
1301,I've been waiting too.
1302,And I'm not a cub anymore!
1303,For king and country!
1304,It's the bird!
1305,I got him! I got him!
1306,Tallyho!
1307,Oh! No! He's got me!
1308,He's got me! Ooh!
1309,Get that bird!
1310,Please! Let's discuss this.
1311,That never gets old!
1312,"It's over, Scar."
1313,Have mercy.
1314,I beg you.
1315,Mercy?
1316,After what you did?
1317,It was the hyenas.
1318,Those revolting scavengers made me do it.
1319,I was planning on killing them all.
1320,You fooled the hyenas.
1321,Just like you fooled me.
1322,Simba...
1323,you wouldn't kill your only uncle.
1324,"No, Scar."
1325,I'm not like you.
1326,"Oh, Simba..."
1327,you are truly noble.
1328,And I will make it up to you.
1329,Just tell me how I can prove myself.
1330,Tell me what you want me to do.
1331,Run.
1332,"Run away, Scar."
1333,Run away and never return.
1334,Yes.
1335,Of course.
1336,As you wish...
1337,Your Majesty.
1338,Aah!
1339,"You can't win, Scar!"
1340,This is my kingdom!
1341,My destiny!
1342,My friends.
1343,"It will take some time, but together we will build our army."
1344,"""Friends"", huh?"
1345,"I thought you said we were ""revolting scavengers""?"
1346,Yeah. That you wanted to kill us?
1347,No.
1348,"No, let me explain."
1349,I was trying to fool him.
1350,We will rule together!
1351,"There's only one true thing you ever said, Scar."
1352,"""A hyena's belly..."
1353,"""is never full."" No!"
1354,Your Majesty.
1355,Remember.
