73,He must have gone up in smoke.
74,He's nowhere to be found.
75,It's pitch black down here and everything is locked.
76,There's no way he could have gotten in here.
77,We have to call the police.
78,Will you do it?
79,It's best if you do.
80,Allan?
81,Allan? Allan!
82,"Allan Narrating  One or two people have screamed at me through the years, from bus conductors to dictators."
83,"Where the fuck are you, old man?"
84,All Shouting   Allan!
85, All Shouting   Allan...
86, Nein!
87,The very first person to scream at me was my mother.
88,"I don't remember it, but I'm sure she did."
89,I'm sure I screamed too.
90,I guess that is what babies do when they arrive in the world.
91,I didn't get much time to hear my father scream.
92, You have blasphemed!
93, Do you mean showing the rubber?
94,It's the only solution to famine and poverty. Is that blasphemy?
95,If you're doing it on Children's Day in the middle of town...
96, Muttering  You can bet your ass it's blasphemy!
97,"There, go!"
98,"Allan Narrating The last time I saw him, I was only nine."
99,I can't live in this hypocritical monarchy!
100,In Russia things get done!
101, Constable  Shut your mouth!
102,Allan Narrating He had gone to Moscow to declare himself leader of a new independent republic.
103,Fifteen square meters where he could be himself.
104,This is the solution to famine and poverty.
105,"With this, the woman doesn't become pregnant."
106,No kids! Nyet'! This is amazing...
107,What are you doing? This is my republic!
108,"Until the Russians came, and, uh,  took care of him."
109,"  Shouting, indistinct The solution to famine and poverty!"

111," Horn Honks   Children  Constable, constable, constable!"
112,Mrs. Karlsson.
113,We were told of Father's death on a sunny April day.
114,"I remember that, because that's the day."
115,I discovered how good it felt to blow things up.
116, Gasps  Everything Father had left behind arrived in a little box.
117,"Mother got a colorful egg, made by some 'Fabbe â guy and I got an old Russian lady doll, matryoshka."
118,"Yes, and a camera."
119,"Yeah, good presents."
120,Mother traded the egg for some food from Gustavsson the merchant.
121,And pork for Mrs. Karlsson.
122,"Well, it turned out to be a good deal..."
123,for him.
124,I guess that's what merchants do.
125,"After Father's death, Mother coughed for two more years before joining him where he might have gone,  that heaven they talk about   Coughing  That's when I started worrying about the future."
126,Yeah. I guess that's what kids do when they become orphans.
127, How am I going to manage?
128," You sound like your father, Allan."
129,He was always thinking for no good reason.
130,And see how he ended up.
131,Thinking will get you nowhere.
132,The only sure thing is that it is what it is.
133,And that it will be what it will be.
134,"Yeah, those were Mother's last words."
135,"And since then, I've been on my own."

151, Have you been on the road long?
152, On the road?
153,That's some serious luggage there.
154,"No, this isn't mine."
155,It just kind of came with me.
156,"So, an old rogue."
157, Chuckles   Are you hungry?
158," Well, food... Mostly thirsty."
159, I think we can fix that.
160, Really? That's nice.
161, Do you know where we're going?
162, I usually jog around here...
163, I could not care less.
164, I mean I know this area really well.

166,Do you know where we're going?
167," Yes, I know the area."
168, Damned lucky for you.
169,What the hell...?
170, What's going on? What's the problem?
171, Out of gas.
172,Damn!
173, Grunts  Do you have a gas can in here?
174, Well?
175, There's only one house in Byringe.
176," It's brown, or light brown."
177, What the hell.
178,And it's a little yellow...
179,or light beige.
180,Where the hell are you going?
181,You don't think he's just gotten lost?
182,"No, I don't. His mind is all there."
183,There is nothing wrong with his mind.
184,Can you imagine? Running away from his own party!
185,Yeah.
186,"And I've spent so much time and effort on him, and he just disappears."
187,"We bought a huge marzipan cake,  good for 40 people at the very least."
188, Mmm.
189,"We ordered it for him, because he likes marzipan cake."
190,We usually get cream cakes.
191,Marzipan gets stuck in old folks' teeth.
192, Mmm.
193, What do I do with that cake now?
194, The old folks here can't eat marzipan.
195, Yeah.
196,"I could consider a Black Forest cake, but it's not my birthday."
197,You give me a call when he returns.
198,Cases like these resolve very quickly.
199,You don't think he went out the window?
200,It was open when we came in singing this morning.
201," Yes, yes."
202, It was actually open.
203,I don't know. It's entirely possible.
204, Call me when he comes. It'll be fine.
205, I don't think so.
206,I hate retirement homes.
207,They think they'll get me into one this fall.
208,I've only set foot in one once.
209," If you've had four drinks, you might as well have another."
210, Chuckles I got some money to entertain the old folks with my accordion.
211,"They sat there, mouths agape."
212, So you're an accordionist?
213, Sure do.
214,"Poor saps, sitting there."

216, Congratulations again.
217," Right, I'd forgotten."
218,Down the hatch.
219,Did you have an old lady?
220,"No, it never turned out that way."
221, Chuckling  How the hell did you avoid that?
222, Do you pee outside?
223, Yeah.

249,Are you fucking nuts? I'm not...
250," Christ, what a smash."
251, You don't say?

253,How about that?
254, We have to get rid of him.
255, What?
256, Before he wakes up.
257, Okay.
258,I have to admit that I'm getting curious  about what's in the suitcase.
259,  Lock Clicks  There! Let's see.

261," Oh, a little much."
262, ...to open it.
263, I'll take that one.
264, Even if you know the combination.
265,"Should we drink it straight, or...?"
266,"Oh, my sweet lord!"

270,Come on and let me out of here!
271,  Banging   I just want that damned suitcase.

279,Allan Narrating  Making grand plans is easy when you're locked up.
280, Orin a jam.
281, Cheers.
282,But it does no good.
283,"Because life is what it is, and it does what it does, as Gustavsson the merchant found out."
284,"Wait here, baby."
285,Hurry back!
286,He'd sneaked away on a wellplanned daytrip.
287,"He picked a sunny day, a beautiful road and just the right hill for his pee break."
288,"And still, it all went to hell."
289,I had chosen the same hill for my explosives test.
290,Screaming  She screamed to high heaven.
291,I guess that's what mistresses do when merchant heads land on car hoods.
292,"Screaming Continues Even if the test was a success, it did land me in the mental hospital."

308,"If you have a negro somewhere, it would be interesting to meet one."
309, Chuckles   Allan's father was a revolutionary.
310," Yes, he was a little special."
311,And the apple doesn't seem to fall far from the tree.
312, Sighs  I think we should err on the side of caution.
313,"Allan Narrating The professor set up the equipment, making sure my genes wouldn't spread into society."

517,Just tell him what happened!
518, Well... that's what I'm doing.
519, You're not doing it very well.
520,Okay. This guy jumped me.
521,He was quite violent.
522,You forgot to mention the old guy.
523,Do it in the right order.
524,"First, there was this old person, a man I sold a ticket to."
525,That was the hundredyearold.
526,He buys a ticket from Ronny.
527,"Then this biker guy shows up, assaults Ronny and makes him drive to Byringe."
528,Hello?
529,Anyone home?
530,Do you know what time it is?
531,"Yeah, it's almost eleven o'clock."
532,Good. That means it's almost time for their lunch break.
533,Hey there.
534, Hi.
535, Bye.
536,I see...
537,I see...
538,That could have been painful.
539,Being dead can have its advantages sometimes.
540, There.
541, Oh.
542, Crowbar Clangs   Do we throw it all out?
543, All of it.

545, He goes in there.
546, Both Grunting  There.
547,Djibouti?
548,"Well, he gets to see the world anyway."

550, Murmuring  You throw like a girl.
551, What?
552," Julius, you'll have to help me pull the suitcase."
553,Now that there's two of us.

566, I see. Julius Johnsson?
567," Yes, exactly."
568,"And a guy in a biker's vest looking all cocky, wearing sunglasses."
569,They way they do these days.
570,He didn't even say hello.
571, Where did you see them?
572, By Akers Styckebruk soccer field.
573, Was it long ago?
574, About half an hour.
575,Are you certain?
576,No.
577,Bye.
578, Muttering  Julius  Hey there.
579,"You wouldn't have room for two hitchhikers, would you?"
580,Uh...
581, Hello.
582, Hello.
583," Sure, I can do that."
584, Great.
585,There's not a lot of room here...
586,We'll put the suitcase in the front.
587, Where are you going?
588, Do you run the store here?
589,"No. God, no."
590,I just work here. I'm a student.
591,You're a student?
592,"Not in primary school, I guess."
593,No. I've tried various things.
594, Studied all sorts of different things.
595, Oh?
596,"I think it's quite a complex issue, with career options and the like."
597, How do you mean?
598," Well, there are..."
599,"There are different, um..."
600,That is to say...
601,"The way I see it, it's..."
602,What?
603,I figure that it's difficult to make decisions about...
604,That's great. Keep all your options open.
605,"Well, never mind."
606,"Uh, get in."
607,Thanks! Thank you.
608,So where are you going?
609,Well... Where are you going?
610, I'm going to the warehouse store.
611, That sounds nice.
612,Are you sure?
613,It's in the middle of nowhere.
614,Yes. The middle of nowhere is underrated.
615,"Yeah, I guess it is."
616,"âªâª Rock Hey, can you mention the sponsor?"
617, That would be awesome.
618, What?
619,The insurance agency Skandia turns 150 and this guy is 100 years old.
620,That would be great.
621,"As a cop, you could do something crazy on it."
622," No, I won't do that."
623, But they're both old.
624," Don't you...? I'm a cop, damn it."
625, But it would be great.
626,"Give up, already. I said no, and I work for the government."
627,I can't be advertising on this damned channel.
628,"Fresh '70s group The Police, with their song âMessage in a Bottleâ."

633, No.
634, No. Chuckles Tell me about that.
635,It's about a man called Allan Karlsson.
636," Aronsson On Radio who, on his 100th birthday, left the Malmkoping retirement home."
637," Deejay Oh, my. A hundred years, huh?"
638,"Is he playing hide and seek, or what?"
639,No. He may have been kidnapped by a biker gang at the Malmkoping station.
640,"Kidnapped? Oh, my."
641, That sounds like some bachelor party  What the hell?
642,"Is he going to marry Anna Nicole Smith, or what?"
643, Chuckling  Aronsson  We would be grateful for any tip offs.
644, Deejay Right. Thanks for being here.
645," Radio Continues, indistinct Line Ringing  Hello?"
646," Hey, I'm sitting in the car."
647,Some cop on the radio is prattling on about some 100yearold who was kidnapped by a biker gang.
648,Did they say kidnapped?
649,"Yes, they just said it on the radio."
650,That has to be Bulten.
651,"Oh, Bulten. You're a dead man now."
652, Do you want anything?
653," Uh, no, that's fine."
654,"BY BIKER GANG  Mufï¬ed  if you need gas, pull the lever."
655,You have to pull the lever to get gasoline.
656,Pull the lever by the pump.
657,No...
658,You need to pull the lever by the pump!
659,Push the handle.
660,Haven't you filled up a car before?
661,You have to pull the lever.
662, Has he kidnapped you?
663, What? Who?
664, Julius.
665, What? No.
666,You have to pull the lever.
667,The headline says you've been kidnapped by bikers.
668,Julius was wearing a biker vest.
669,I just saw it.
670,"No, the biker vest isn't his."
671,He took it from that bald kid.
672, A little kid?
673, He doesn't need it now. He's dead.
674,I hit him with a croquet mallet.
675, Did you kill...?
676," No, no. He froze to death."
677,Okay...?
678,"The bald kid came to me, sweat pouring off his face."
679,I guess he had the runs.
680,"He was not doing well, so he handed me the suitcase."
681,There's 50 million in it.
682, What?
683, We haven't taken it.
684, Drive!
685, What is this?
686, Hit it!
687, He can't pump gas.
688, Never mind that. Drive!
689, Alright.
690,"Julius  Step on it, Benny! Step on it!"
691,The lady at the register saw me.
692,What did she see?
693,This little bag happened to drop into my pocket.
694, You want one?
695," Yes, please."
696,"So you shoplifted, eh?"
697,What the hell?
698,Julius  What?
699,What the hell has happened?
700,I apologize.
701,"Of course you, as a store employee, get upset when I just grab a..."
702,Allan  He can't break a millioncrown stack for some candy.
703,I don't care about the candy!
704,What have you done? Well?
705, Benny Mutters  I'll never ask for information through the radio again.
706," No, it didn't turn out too well."
707, Why do we even do that?
708, Akers Styckebruk called.
709, And?
710,The dog indicated a corpse on the rail bike.
711, A corpse?
712," Yes, exactly."
713,"Benny, how about you skip the warehouse store and come with us instead?"
714,Or do you have an exam on Monday?
715,What will you do with the money?
716,"I expect we'll split it up. Right, Julius?"
717,Yeah...
718,"We'll have to talk about that later, because we're not in a good spot."
719,Please step on it.
720, Benny So... who does the money belong to?
721,You didn't win it in the lottery.
722,Allan Narrating So what? Does anyone really own anything?
723,"I mean, everything seems to change hands sooner or later."
724," In English  Extra, extra!"
725,Like that pistol Franco gave me.
726,I traded it for...
727,ffor a work permit when I got to America.
728," Man, In English Hey, Allan!"
729,"You know they're looking for people, right?"
730,  Mutters   In English  Who?
731," Yeah, for the Manhattan Project."
732,Manhatt... What Manhattan Project?
733,"Yeah, man."
734,"The Manhattan Project, Allan."
735,"You ask me, I think when we get a chance, we gotta try and get us an interview or something."
736,"Hey, you see my fucking hammer up there?"
737," In Swedish  That sounds great to my ears, I can tell you that."
738,"What you saying, man?"
739,Me and you could make a change.
740, In English  ls... That's very good.
741,That's a good project.
742,It's time that somebody does something about it.
743,It's bitter.
744,Bitter?
745,"Man, what the fuck you talkin' 'bout?"
746,The... the Manhattan drink. Here.
747,  Man Screams For fuck's sake!
748, Shit.
749,"You know, you drink it."
750,The Manhattan drink.
751,"Man, what the hell you mean, man?"
752, In Swedish  it's like kissing a German Shepherd's ass.
753,It's a bomb.
754,It's the biggest bomb on earth.
755, In English  it's a bomb project?
756,"Allan Narrating And just like that, my urge to blow things up was back."
757,"II have to say, it was a wonderful feeling."
758,It's not gonna work.
759,We tried that last week.
760,"Maybe some coffee will help you, sir."
761,Coffee.
762,"Ah, thanks."
763,"And still nono bomb today, I guess?"
764,"Mr. Oppenheimer, I really must say I am quite disappointed."
765,Nothing happens here.
766,"No explosions, nothing. It's..."
767," Your name's Allan, yeah?"
768, Allan.
769,"Allan, this is just not any bomb."
770,We need to figure out some pretty complicated things here.
771,"No, no, butbut you have to kkeep on testing, You have to start testing again."
772,"As my mother used to say, âDon't think so much. JustJust do itâ."
773,"Yeah, but what your mom didn't tell you is that to detonate this bomb we need to solve a minor but crucial fucking problem."
774,Yeah? What's the problem?
775,"Allan... I'm gonna give you a minute, okay?"
776,"Oh, good."
777," For what we're going for,  Mmhmm."
778,We need to use twice as much plutonium as we're using now.
779,"So, what are you waiting for?"
780, Laughing  WWe can't just add twice as much plutonium.
781,It's unstable.
782,It just falls apart. It's simple physics.
783,"I know, you been talking about this for weeks now, but listen."
784," Uh, I give you a minute, okay?"
785, Okay.
786,I had a little theory on this.
787,"What if you take halfhalf here, and half there and put it together..."
788, In Swedish  Just a few seconds...
789, In English  Just before the explosion.
790,"Yeah. Now, that's the problem."
791,"How are we gonna do that, with a falling bomb encased in metal, up in the air?"
792, Mumbles  Do you have some dynamite?
793, Explosion   Allan Narrating  It was that easy to get the bomb going.
794,  Cheering   Everyone was terribly excited.
795,Not least Harry.
796,"The vice president, Harry S. Truman."
797,I'm gonna buy you the biggest drink you have ever drunk.
798,Thank you.
799,"Sighs  In Swedish  Damn, a pee stain."
800,"You know, you've done mankind a great service, my friend."
801, Yeah.
802, You listen to me?
803, Whatever you do...
804, You have done...
805,You have changed the world.
806,You push and you pull...
807,You have changed the world for the better.
808,But the last drop still ends up in your pants.
809, Listen to me.
810,"  In English  Yeah, I'm listening."
811,There will be no more wars after this invention of yours.
812,"Thanks to you, my friend."
813," Imitates Explosion, Laughs America, and the world, will never have to fight again  because people will know the power, the awesome power..."
814,"  Man Clears Throat  Gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt you."
815, Truman  Imagine that.
816,Mr. Truman.
817, What is it?
818, There's a phone call.
819,It's a phone call you'll have to take.
820,I gotta take this. Never go into politics.
821, Yello?
822," Man Sir, um..."
823, Allan Narrating A boozedup American can talk anyone's head off.
824,It takes a lot to shut them up.
825,Something like a president dying.
826,Oh. Jesus Christ.
827," Alright, be right there."
828," Man Thank you, sir."
829,Allan Narrating  Which is exactly what President Roosevelt went and did that day.
830," In Swedish  Now, here..."
831, In English  Hey! HHarry. Harry. Harry!
832, You forgot your...  it's a vicepresidential lighter. You keep it.
833,Harry didn't mind things changing hands either.
834, Mr. Karlsson?
835," Well, Allan."
836, Welcome back to Sweden.
837, Thank you.
838,"Uh, Prime Minister Erlander invites you to a welcome dinner."
839,I had barely set foot in Sweden before I was shanghaied to a dinner at the Grand.
840,Good timing.
841,The food on the airplane was terrible.
842, I am pretty hungry.
843, Then get in.
844,"And one soldier got up and said, âDuck, everyone! He's reloading!â  Laughing   Clears Throat Harry S. Truman himself said Allan was a very nice man who has also done much for the US."
845,"I don't know about that, but we had some party."
846,Tell me. I am terribly curious.
847,We were drinking tequila.
848, Loads of tequila.
849, I meant what happened before that.
850,Before that?
851,"No, we only had tequila throughout."
852,"Harry wanted bourbon, but that's kid's stuff."
853,"Mr. Karlsson, I refer to the work."
854, When I worked on Manhattan?
855, Yes.
856,You couldn't have tequila then.
857,That would be lethal.
858,It goes to your head.
859,"Excuse me, I have to leave."
860,The government is calling.
861,"That is to say, my wife."
862, Laughing   Shutter Clicks  Enough of that. The meal's on me.
863,Tell Engineer Eklund the rest. Good night.
864,Okay Bye.
865,The Prime Minister asked me to...
866, Do you think he'll be back?
867, No.
868,Then I'll take his steak.
869,It would be a shame for it to go to waste.
870,The Prime Minister has asked me to inquire if we might have room for Mr. Karlsson at the Atomic Energy Commission.
871, How nice.
872," So, how about your studies?"
873,Not much to get excited about.
874,Just three years.
875,Only three years of academic studies?
876,"Yes, I quit when I was nine."
877, Nine?
878," Yes, nine. Or ten."
879,"I was ten! No, hold on."
880,I turned ten that year.
881,So I was nine when I quit school.
882,Here's a little fella that wants to jump down my gullet.
883,You can have his.
884,Allan Narrating That guy was gone faster than shit through a goose.
885,But he wasn't the only one at the Grand fishing for my attention.
886," In English  Good evening, Mr. Karlsson."
887,"I am Popov, Julij Popov."
888,I am a physicist. We are colleagues.
889,Maybe we should take walk.
890,"Um, together."
891,It seems like we need some fresh air.
892, In Swedish  What the hell...?
893,"Hey, Popov! Popov."
894,"Stop there, my dear."
895,You have some nice things.
896,I'll have an akvavit.
897," In English  YYou pay for this, huh?"
898,  In Swedish  Give her a fifty.
899, How much?
900,  In English  Fifty.
901, Fifty.
902," In Swedish  Yes, that's fine."
903,This one was mischievous.
904,I'm starting to feel it now.
905,I feel great now!
906,"Popov No. No, no, Allan."
907,We'd just like you to share some of your experience and knowledge with us.
908,Allan  I see. You don't say?
909,  Popov It could be very lucrative for you.
910, Hmm?
911, In English  ButBut why?
912,"Well, how shall I say..."
913,Comrade Stalin is a very nice man.
914,I see. I just like to blow up things.
915,Yes! I like this too.
916, What? YYou do?
917, Yes.
918,"You know, I..."
919,"Just give me some dynamite, and Il blow up anything."
920, Fucking shit.
921, Submarine Surfacing   In Swedish Damn...
922,"Allan  What the hell is that doing here, inside the archipelago?"

927,Julius  Sjotorp? A sea hut sounds nice.
928,Hello!
929, Hi.
930, Julius Hi.
931,We're wondering if we could rent a room for the night.
932,This isn't a goddamned hotel.
933,I live here.
934,But we'll pay you well.
935,We have money. That's not an issue.
936,I see.
937,"Are you on the run, or what?"
938,It's fine. I get that it seems odd...
939, Hello.
940, Us just showing up like this.
941, Here's another geezer.
942,  Benny The thing is...
943, Hi.
944, ...we got a little lost.
945, We would be very grateful if...
946, Allan.
947," Hello, you. I'm Gunilla."
948, Nice to meet you.
949,We'll see about that.
950,I guess I'll have to squeeze you guys in somehow.
951,But no one pisses himself.
952,You sleep in the barn if you do.
953, Thanks.
954,  Elephant Trumpets  What's that?
955, Sonja.
956," Elephant Trumpets, Growls Look at that."
957,"I see. Well, hello there."
958,Not bad.
959," Chattering, indistinct   Water Shoots  Is she about 40?"
960,Sonja? I don't have a clue.
961,Why do you think that?
962,"I'm almost a zoologist, so I think that's right."
963,Almost? How can you be âalmostâ?
964,"Well, I'm almost done."
965,I almost finished my studies.
966, Where did you find her?
967, At a circus.
968, I see. Does she know any tricks?
969,  Sonja Trumpets  I honestly don't have a clue.
970,Circuses are just perpetual animal cruelty.
971," Sure, absolutely."
972, What?
973,I hate circuses too.
974,That was the only good thing my ex did.
975,He saw that I felt for her and he took care of it.
976,"Shouting  All Shouting, indistinct  Laughing  So he just took her?"
977,Took? An elephant owns itself.
978,Yeah...
979,  Benny Allan!
980, What?
981,"Hey, you can't do that."
982, Hold on there!
983, The ï¬ame was too weak.
984,It should taste grilled.
985,  Gunilla  What the hell is that?
986,  Benny French potato salad.
987,Gunilla I can see that. I mean that green mess.
988, Looks tasty.

992,"No, you're joking. Cut it out."
993,"Sadly, no. I'm almost a lot of things."
994,"Almost a veterinarian, almost an economist."
995,"Almost a pharmacologist, almost a human resources specialist."
996,  Gunilla  What the hell?
997,  Benny Yeah.

999,"No. I mean yes, I am..."
1000,I am single. I'm available.
1001, Maybe you were kidding?
1002," No, but I hope you are."
1003,"No, I'm not."
1004,"In the last 18 years, I've amassed 920 college credits."
1005, Good lord...
1006, I have a strong thirst for knowledge.
1007,"You have to stop lying to yourself, or everything could go to hell."
1008,You could end up with nothing.
1009,"That's one possible analysis, but there are several aspects..."
1010,Gunilla What the hell are you doing here?
1011,What are you doing here?
1012,Uh...
1013,I wanted to pick some stuff up.
1014,There's nothing to pick up.
1015,"Yes, there is."
1016,I just wanted to get my bowls.
1017, What fucking bowls?
1018, The blue fucking bowls with ï¬owers.
1019,You gave them to me for my birthday!
1020,And now you want them?
1021,I changed my mind and want my bowls.
1022,"Go fuck yourself, Ricky."
1023,Get out of here. You don't belong here.

1025," Yes, he's nice."
1026, He's the best. So damned good.
1027, Sure.
1028,Good fingers. We call it âmaking loveâ.
1029,"Ricky, good to meet you. Congratulations."
1030,Thanks.

1041,"Allan  Oh, my. He really slipped the clutch."
1042,Gunilla! Gunilla!
1043,I don't know what's wrong with me.
1044,I always end up with idiots like that.
1045,I attract them.
