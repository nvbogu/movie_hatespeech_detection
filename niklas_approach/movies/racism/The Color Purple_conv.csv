451,Got a new baby and it cry all night long.
452,Kept him up so he said he wasn't going to work.
453,"She got all upset but I said, ""Leave the man alone."
454,"Sometimes a man just needs to be left alone."" I need something to eat!"
455,Pie's in the pantry. Women need to be left alone sometimes.
456,"I tell Harpo when I'm fussing, ""Leave me alone!""  Ain't you gonna get it for me?"
457, What's the matter with you?
458,That's my own baby crying. Lord.
459,"Make yourself useful, Harpo."
460,"Hush now, honey."
461,What am I gonna do about Sofia?
462,Beat her.

468,Busted my eye and my lip.
469,All my life I had to fight.
470,"I had to fight my daddy, I had to fight my uncles."
471,I had to fight my brothers.
472,Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.
473,But I never thought I had to fight in my own house!
474,I loves Harpo.

479,"No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face."
480,"No, sir."
481,"You want a dead soninlaw, Miss Celie?"
482,You keep on advising him like you doing.
483,This life be over soon.
484,Heaven lasts always.
485,You should bash Mister's head open and think about Heaven later.
486,Sofia beat on Harpo.
487,Then Harpo beat on Sofia.
488,And then Sofia beat on Harpo some more.
489,"In between the beatings, the children keep coming."
490,"And then one day, Sofia can't take it no more."
491,And good riddance!

967,No such a thing.
968,How could you leave me alone for so Iong?
969,Come on now. Come on.
970,What am I gonna do about the car?
971,"Jack will drive you home, Miss Millie."

1040,"""The lady you met in town is named Corrine."" Her husband's named Samuel."
1041,"Sanctified, religious and very good to me."
1042,Their only sorrow in the beginning was...
1043,...that they could not have children.
1044,"And then they say""...."
1045,"""Then they say..."" ...God sent them Olivia..."
1046,...and Adam.
1047,"Yes, their children sent by God are your children."
1048,And they have been brought up in love.
1049,And now God has sent me to watch over them...
1050,...to protect and cherish them...
1051,...to lavish all the love I feel for you on them.
1052,"It's a miracle, isn't it?"
1053,And no doubt impossible for you to believe.
1054,Olivia and Adam are with me...
1055,...all growing up together...
1056,...a family.
1057,"""Your loving sister, Nettie."" I got two children..."
1058,...and they's alive.
1059,"Hear that, Miss Shug?"
1060,Olivia and Adam.
1061,And they's alive.
1062,"I love her as much as you, probably more."
1063,I's getting real tired of this cat.
1064,He coming back soon.
1065,You crazy? He in the jook joint.
1066,This doesn't look nothing Iike me.
1067,Damn him.
1068,"""Celie."" There's so many of them."
1069,What us gonna do?
1070,Go to my room and put them in order by the postmark.
1071,"""Dear Celie, the reason why I am in Africa is because..."" ...one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel..."
1072,...to help with the children and setting up the school...
1073,"""...suddenly married a man, and I came in her place."" I wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship."
1074,On my first sight of the Africa coast...
1075,"...something struck in me, in my soul, Celie, like a large bell."
1076,I just vibrated.
1077,"It has been a long time since I had time to write, but always..."
1078,"...no matter what I'm doing, I'm writing you. Dear Celie! Bring me a cool drink."
1079,Olinka is four days march through the bush from the harbor.
1080,Do you know what a jungle is?
1081,Trees and trees and then more trees on top of that.
1082,And big!
1083,"They are so big, they look like they were built."
1084,And vines and ferns and animals and noises...
1085,...that make you wonder what is lurking behind the shadows...
1086,...of every bush.
1087,"We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of millet, porridge, fruit, then morning classes."
1088,"We teach the children English, reading, writing..."
1089,"...history, geography, arithmetic, and the stories of the Bible."
1090,The older children are used to coming to the mission school.
1091,The smaller ones are not.
1092,Their mothers sometimes drag them here screaming and kicking.
1093,They're all boys. Olivia's the only girl.
1094,There is a little African girl called Tashi.
1095,She plays with Olivia after school.
1096,"""Why can't Tashi come to school?"" she asks me."
1097,I told her the Olinka don't believe in educating girls.
1098,"She said, quick as a flash: ""Like white people at home who don't want black people to learn."" She is sharp, Celie."
1099,When Tashi can get away from her chores her mother assigns her...
1100,...she and Olivia hide in my hut.
1101,"To Olivia right now, Tashi alone is Africa."
1102,"Everything she learns, she shares with Tashi. Sound familiar?"
1103,"At first, there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest."
1104,A kind of low humming. Then there was chopping and the sound of dragging.
1105,Then the scent.
1106,Some days there's smoke.
1107,"Now, after two months during which I or the children..."
1108,...or Corrine has been sick...
1109,...all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging.
1110,And every day we smell smoke.
1111,"Today a boy in my afternoon class burst out as he entered: ""The road approaches!"" âª If you live right âª âª Heaven belongs to you âª âª If you live right âª âª Heaven belongs to you âª Dear Celie, the white man is building a road."
1112,It finally reached the cassava fields nine months ago.
1113,"The morning after the road was done, as far as Olinka was concerned..."
1114,"...what should we discover, but that the road builders were back."
1115,They have instructions to continue the road for another 30 miles...
1116,...and continue it on its present course right through the village of Olinka.
1117,The road builders didn't deviate an inch from the head man's plan.
1118,Every hut that lay in the road's path was leveled.
1119,"Celie, our church, our school..."
1120,...my hut...
1121,...all went down in a matter of hours.
1122,But the worst is yet to be told.
1123,Sweet Corrine died from fever and grief.
1124,We buried her in the Olinka way.
1125,"But, Celie, my dear, sweet sister..."
1126,...we'll all be coming home once we work something out with U.S. lmmigration.
1127,"They don't know if we're American, African, or missionary."
1128,"Just pray for us, Celie."
1129,Watch for me in the sunset.
1130,What's with you?
1131,I was calling you for an hour!
1132,Now get my shave and don't keep me waiting!
1133,"Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!"
1134, Where's Celie?
1135, Home fixing to shave Mister.
1136,You got a fever? I didn't come here for you to take all day to shave me.
1137,Get the molasses out of your ass!
1138,"The longer I'm married to you, the slower and dumber you get."
1139,Your ass is as slow as I ever seen it before.
1140,Celie! Ain't that razor sharpened yet?
1141,Get on out here and do me right now!
1142,Get on out here!
1143,All right.
1144,No!
1145,Put your head back.
1146,Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears.
1147,"That razor looks dull to me, Miss Celie."
1148,Damn women.
1149,"How you feeling, Miss Sofia?"
1150,Confused.
1151,Ain't you glad to be home?
1152,Maybe.
1153,"Grandpa, I'm full."
1154,I'm not hungry anymore.
1155, Now come the time for me to tell you.
1156, What?
1157,It's time for us to go.
1158,You're such good people.
1159,Salt of the earth.
1160,It's time to move on.
1161, Celie is coming with us.
1162, Say what?
1163,Celie is coming to Memphis with us.
1164,Over my dead body!
1165,You satisfied? That's what you want?
1166,Now what's wrong with you?
1167,"You a lowdown, dirty dog, that's what's wrong."
1168,It's time for me to get away from you and enter Creation.
1169,Your dead body be just the welcome mat I need.
1170,You can't talk to my boy that way.
1171,Your boy.
1172,"If he hadn't been your boy, he might have been a halfway decent man."
1173,Say what?
1174,You took my sister Nettie away from me.
1175,You knew she was the only somebody in the world who loved me.
1176,But Nettie and my kids are coming home soon.
1177,"And when we all get together, we're going to whup your ass."
1178,Nettie and your kids?
1179,"Woman, you talking crazy."
1180,I got children.
1181,My children are Iiving in Africa.
1182,Africa!
1183,Learning different languages.
1184,"Fresh air, plenty of exercise."
1185,They'll turn out better than these fools you never tried to raise.
1186," Hold on, here!"
1187," No ""hold on,"" Harpo."
1188,"If you hadn't tried to rule over Sofia, white folks wouldn't have got her."
1189, That's a lie!
1190, A Iittle truth in it.
1191,Y'all was rotten kids.
1192,You was. You was rotten kids!
1193,Made my life here hell.
1194,Your daddy ain't nothing but some dead horseshit.
1195,Shut up! It's bad luck for a woman to laugh at a man!
1196,"My God, the dead has arisen."
1197,I had enough bad luck to keep me laughing the rest of my life.
1198,Sat in that jail till I near about done rot to death.
1199,"I know what it like, Miss Celie."
1200,Want to go somewhere and can't.
1201,I know what it like to want to sing and have it beat out of you.
1202,"I want to thank you, Miss Celie..."
1203,...for everything you done for me.
1204,I remember the day I was in the store with Miss Millie.
1205,I was feeling real down.
1206,I was feeling mighty bad.
1207,And when I see'd you...
1208,...I knowed there is a God.
1209,"I knowed there is a God, and one day I was going to get to come home."
1210,You won't get a penny of my money.
1211,Not one thin dime!
1212,Did I ever ask you for anything?
1213,Did I ever ask you for anything?
1214,I never asked you for nothing! Not even for your sorryass hand in marriage!
1215,Nothing. I never asked you for nothing!
1216,Old Sofia home now. Sofia home.
1217,Things are going to change around here.
1218,I'm going with Shug.

1224," Listen, Squeak  My name ain't Squeak."
1225, What?
1226, My name is Mary Agnes.
1227, Mary what?
1228, Mary Agnes.
1229,I thought it was Squeak.
1230,"Who gives a damn? Boy, you going to let this nappyhaired gal sit here..."
1231,...and cuss you out?
1232,You're at the head of your own table...
1233,...and you acting like a waiter!
1234,"Hush, you old fool!"
1235,Always meddling in somebody's business.
1236,Sofia home now. Just hush up!
1237,She'll be back. Shug got talent.
1238,She can sing.
1239,She got spunk and can talk to anybody.
1240,She can stand up and be noticed.
1241,What you got?
1242,You're ugly. You're skinny.
1243,You're shaped funny.
1244,You're too scared to open your mouth to people.
1245, All you fit to do is be Shug's maid.
1246," Albert, no."
1247,"Take out her slop jar, maybe cook her food."
1248,You ain't even that good a cook.
1249,She's a lot better than that first wife you married.
1250,This house ain't been cleaned good since my first wife died.
1251,Nobody's crazy enough to marry you.
1252,So what you gonna do?
1253,Hire yourself to farm?
1254,Maybe somebody will let you work on their railroad.
1255,Maybe sweep out the caboose.
1256,Any more letters come?
1257,Could be. Could be not. Who's to say?
1258,"Celie, no!"
1259,I curse you! Until you do right by me...
1260,...everything you think about will crumble!
1261,Don't do it. Don't trade places with what I been through.
1262,"Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go to the car."
1263,He ain't worth it.
1264,Who you think you is?
1265,You can't curse nobody. Look at you!
1266,"You're black, you're poor, you're ugly, you're a woman! You're nothing!"
1267,"Until you do right by me, everything you even think about gonna fail!"
1268,It's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
1269,Goodbye.
1270,Glad I came back just in time.
1271,"We need some stability around here, that's for sure."
1272,I should have locked you up!
1273,Just let you out to work!
1274,The jail you planned for me is the one you gonna rot in.
1275,"Celie, get in the car. Get in the car."
1276,Everything you done to me...
1277,...is already done to you.
1278,"I'm poor, black."
1279,I may even be ugly.
1280,"But dear God, I'm here!"
1281,I'm here!
1282,"Hey, you'll be back!"
1283,Hahaha!

1288,"Hey, Pa."
1289,This house is a wreck!
1290,Been drinking.
1291,You want some supper?
1292,"No, thank you."
1293,I hear you been spending more time at Harpo's and less in the fields.
1294,I guess I just raised you wrong.
1295,"How's that, Pa?"
1296,How's that?
1297,"The fields are overgrown, the animals ain't tended to..."
1298,...this house is a wreck.
1299,And what you doing about it? Nothing.
1300,"Just sitting here drinking, ruining your life."
1301,My Iife's already ruined.
1302,This house is dead.
1303,"There ain't no Shug, no children..."
1304,...no laughter and no life. Just me.
1305,I ain't heard such nonsense in all my life.
1306,Now listen to me.

1323,"Come on, time to go."
1324,Time to go now. Come on!
1325,"I got some Tennessee tobacco, cured with whiskey."

1342,"My children, not my sister and brother."
1343,"Pa, not Pa."
1344,You his wife?
1345,"Yes, ma'am."
1346,How'd he die?
1347,On top of me.
1348,"Well, it's all yours now."
1349,"Yeah, but I still don't understand how."
1350,Your real daddy owned this land and the house and the store.
1351,He left it to your mama.
1352,"When your mama died, it passed on to you and your sister, Nettie."
1353,He left me the money though.
1354,"Well, if you'll excuse us, we got a train to catch."
1355,Yachachachachacha!
1356,I ain't never figured I'd wear pants.
1357,Not to mention the things Miss Celie made.
1358,What you think?
1359,"Sofia, Sofia. That sure is a pretty name."
1360,Now let me see you. How can a pair of pants that fits Sofia fit me?
1361,"Well, Harpo, you just going to have to try them on."
1362,"It's just like my sign say: ""One size fit all."" Go in there, try them on and you'll see."
1363, Sure enough?

1365,Make sure you close that curtain.

1367,He ain't changed a lick.
1368,I got this fabric from Washington.
1369,I wanted to make you a pair of pants.
1370,I don't know about no....
1371,Harpo says I spend too much money.
1372,"Miss Celie, you is a miracle!"
1373,"Ho, ho, Harpo."
1374,Where will you wear them britches?
1375, Nowhere.
1376, I know you're not! Look at you!
1377,"The more things change, the more they stay the same."
1378,"Me and Shug, I smile."
1379,But us still longing.
1380,"More than anything, God love admiration."
1381,You saying God is vain?
1382,"No, not vain."
1383,Just wanting to share a good thing.
1384,I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple...
1385,...in a field...
1386,...and you don't notice it.
1387,Are you saying it just want to be loved like it say in the Bible?
1388,"Yeah, Celie."
1389,Everything want to be loved.
