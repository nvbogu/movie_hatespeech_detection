422,Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is?
423,This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny.
424,"Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear."
425,The Inner Map Theory is an example ...
426,"of how each soul begins with an imprint, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul ..."
427,before you've even gotten here.
428,"You know, I guess the reason why I like Japan the best ..."
429,"out of all Asian countries, is because I really feel close to Buddhism."
430,I really feel ...
431,I really believe in reincarnation.
432,"That's part of what drew me to Midnight Velocity as well, because although Keanu dies, he eventually gets reincarnated."
433,"So there's hope. There's hope in reincarnation, I think."
434,What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?
435,"He was always so ... He was always, you know, giving me ideas, and, you know, really helpful."
436,"He made me feel really comfortable, so ..."
437,"And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A., so we have all these different things in common."
438,"So, you know, we both really like Mexican food, and yoga and ..."
439,karate!
440,Mexican food. Yoga.
441,Konnichiwa.
442, Hello.
443, Hi.
444,Okay.

448,to some nice women.
449,"Beautiful women too. I mean, you and I would be crazy for these women."
450,But there were always rumors.
451,"I never liked his acting, so I never gave a damn whether he was straight or not."
452,Thank you. Hi. Thanks.
453,What can I get you?
454,I'm not sure.
455,"For relaxing times, make it Suntory time."
456,I'll have a vodka tonic.
457,Thanks.
458,"So, what are you doing here?"
459,A couple of things.
460,"Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday ..."
461,and getting paid $2 million ...
462,to endorse a whisky ...
463,when I could be doing a play somewhere.
464,Oh.
465,"But the good news is, the whisky works."
466,What are you doing?
467,"My husband's a photographer, so he's here working, and I wasn't doing anything, so I came along."
468,And we have some friends that live here.
469,How long have you been married?
470,Thank you.
471,Two years.
472,Twentyfive long ones.
473,You're probably just having a midlife crisis.
474,Did you buy a Porsche yet?
475,"You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche."
476,Twentyfive years. That's a ...
477,"Well, it's impressive."
478,"Well, you figure you sleep onethird of your life."
479,That knocks off eight years of marriage right there.
480,So you're down to 16 and change.
481,You're just a teenager at marriage.
482,"You can drive it, but there's still the occasional accident."
483,Yeah.
484,What do you do?
485,"I'm not sure yet, actually."
486,I just graduated last spring.
487,What did you study?
488,Philosophy.
489,"Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket."
490,Yeah.
491,"Well, so far it's pro bono."
492,"Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles."
493,Yeah.
494,I hope your Porsche works out.
495,"Cheers to that, huh?"
496,Cheers to that.
497,Wish I could sleep.
498,"Me, too."
499,"âª One, two, three, and okay âª All right."
500,"âª One, two, three, four âª âª And one, two, three, four âª âª And one, two ... âª ~ Wait! Take me with you! ~ How'd it go, huh?"
501,"Oh, it was good, you know."
502,I'm tired.
503,"Yeah, I gotta go downstairs and meet Kelly for some drinks."
504,She wants to talk about some photo thing.
505,Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.
506,"Oh, you wanna come?"
507,"Yeah, sure."
508,Okay. Yeah.
509,"âª You âª âª Stepped out of a dream âª Everybody is always like, ""Kelly, you are anorexic."" And I'm like, ""No, I'm not."" I eat so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it."
510,Just because I have a high metabolism.
511,Because I thought you were anorexic too.
512,Everybody does.
513,Everybody thinks that.
514,"Yeah, 'cause you look so ..."
515,"Thank you. I know, but it's ..."
516,"I mean, I eat whatever."
517,I have a really high metabolism.
518, Yeah.
519, But ...
520,My dad is an anorexic.
521, Really?
522," Oh, really?"
523,Yeah.
524,He fought on the American side of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.
525,"He was taken prisoner, and the whole time he was there they tortured him about food."
526,Every day they told him they put poison in the food.
527,So they would always make themselves throw up after every meal.
528,That's horrible. That's terrible.
529,That's some crazy shit.
530, You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
531, No.
532,"You know that break beat, right?"
533,"Well, I been taking it to some next level shit."
534,"Like, I'll take that and put a delay on it, so it's like ..."
535,"So it's, like, evolving the beat."
536,"So it, like, sounds hella large on the track. You know what I'm saying?"
537, No.
538, No?
539,You don't listen to hiphop?
540,"Oh, my God!"
541,You guys gotta listen.
542,I tried this power cleanse.
543,It's so amazing.
544,"Okay, promise me you'll try it."
545,Will you try this power cleanse?
546," I did it last week, and it's amazing."
547, I'll be right back.
548,"It's so good to get the toxins out of your body, you know."
549,"With all, like, the pollution, all, like, the ..."
550, Hello.

555,"So, you having a nice time?"
556,Can you keep a secret?
557,I'm trying to organize a prison break.
558,"I'm looking for, like, an accomplice."
559,"We'd have to, first, get out of this bar."
560,"Then the hotel, then the city and then the country."
561,"Are you in, or are you out?"
562,I'm in.
563,Good. I'll go pack my stuff.
564,Get your coat.
565,See you.
566,I hope you've had enough to drink.

571,"Well, I'm ... I gotta go."
572,"I mean, I ..."
573,"You know, you don't have to stay."

711,"~ I'm glad you like it. ~ I saw a great house tonight that you would've loved, and that burgundy would've been good in this house, really."
712,~ Really? ~ A guy designed his own house and built it.
713,"~ Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it. ~ He's a fashion guy."
714,All these fashion people were there.
715,"And there were Japanese surfers there, and the guy was playing really, really, really great music."
716,I should've found out what it was and brought some ...
717,I'll bring some back.
718,I'll try to find out.
719,~ That sounds great.
720,Can you hold on? ~ ~ You have to have something for breakfast. Do you want some cereal? ~ Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.
721,~ I'm just trying to get her to eat something. ~ Yeah. Tell her I said she has to eat something.

735,That was a stupid idea.
736," I was feeling tight, you know?"
737, Mmmhmm.
738, Shoulders and neck.
739, Mmmhmm.
740,So I called down and had a ...
741,shiatsu massage in my room.
742,That's nice.
743,And the tightness has completely disappeared ...
744,and been replaced by ...
745,unbelievable pain.
746,"Just staggering, unbearable pain."
747,That's too bad.
748, Yeah.
749, I'm in pain.
750,"I got my foot banged up, and ..."

759,Didn't you feel any pain? Your ...
760,"Yeah, it really hurt."
761,It was ...
762,Yeah. That toe is almost dead.
763,I think I gotta take you to a doctor.
764,You can't just put that back in the shoe.
765,No. I don't think so.
766,"Well, you either go to a doctor, or you leave it here."
767,He's smiling.
768,You like that idea?
769,"See, they love black toe over in this country."
770,You got a sharp knife?
771,"Gotta be, you know, in this country, somebody's gotta prefer a black toe."
772,"""Brack toe."" Or we should probably hang around until someone orders it."
773,"Hey, what's with the straight face?"
774,Hospital regulations.
775,Get in there.
776, All right. Thank you.
777, All right.
778,"Careful, okay? No, don't!"

790,Yeah. We need a doctor.
791,For a hurt ... Emergency room.

794,"Okay, do we fill this out?"
795,We go over there?
796,Which number?
797,"We're not going to another hospital, so whatever you say is okay."
798,Okay.
799,Could you put that back in the garage for us?
800,"""In desuka""?"
801,Japan.

809,"Yeah, it can be for you."
810,"Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte."
811,"I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called Orange around 10:00, so I'll fax you a map on how to get there."

835,You were very dashing.
836,I liked the mascara.
837,But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
838,Really?
839,You don't remember?
840,"I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?"
841,Did I scowl at you?
842,"No, you smiled."
843,I did?
844,"Yes, it was a complete accident."
845,A freak. I haven't seen it since.
846,Just that one time.
847,"Like that, but bigger."
848,"Bigger. Yeah, big, big ..."
849,"Well, not that big."
850,"~ My goodness. ~ ~ Marcello, come here. Hurry up. ~ Why do they switch the ""R's"" and the ""L's"" here?"
851,"Oh, for yuks."
852,"You know, just to mix it up."
853,"They have to amuse themselves, 'cause we're not making them laugh."
854,"Let's never come here again, 'cause it would never be as much fun."
855,Whatever you say. You're the boss.
856,I'm stuck.
857,Does it get easier?
858,No.
859,Yes.
860,It gets easier.

868,You know?
869,"I tried being a writer, but ..."
870,I hate what I write.
871,"And I tried taking pictures, but they're so mediocre, you know."
872,Every girl goes through a photography phase.
873,"You know, like horses?"
874,You know?
875,Take dumb pictures of your feet.
876,You'll figure that out.
877,I'm not worried about you.
878,Keep writing.
879,But I'm so mean.
880, Mean's okay.
881, Yeah?
882,What about marriage?
883,Does that get easier?
884,That's hard.
