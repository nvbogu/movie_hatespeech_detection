0,Whoa.
1,Oh my God.
2,It's beautiful.
3,Oh this is just what I need right now.
4,And look at the fucking coastline.
5,"Oh, I want it now."
6,"Well, it's available this weekend."
7,"Oh, maybe that's why."
8,"Shit, is that per night?"
9,Whoa.
10,Fuck it.
11,You need it.
12,Yo.
13,Oh hey.
14,Hi.
15,"Hey, sorry am I interrupting?"
16,"No, to at all."
17,My baby.
18,What's up bro?
19,"Hey, man nothing, I was just dropping off someone in the neighborhood, thought I'd pop in, see if you needed a ride home."
20,"Oh, yeah."
21,Yeah.
22,"Yeah, we're just about finished."
23,Does she request you on the app or can you go rogue?
24,"I think we'll get away with it, this time, yeah."
25,What you guys looking at?
26,"This house on the coast, we figured it might be fun if the four of us took a trip this weekend, celebrate the closing of seat funding."
27,"It's gonna be a shit ton of work, so we figured it'll be nice to take a little vacation before we start."
28,"Yeah, cool."
29,I'm just gonna grab my jacket.
30,Okay.
31,"Hey, I meant to text you, congratulations, it's a really big deal."
32,Thanks man.
33,Yeah.
34,"Okay, let's hit it."
35,You all set?
36,Yeah.
37,"All right, I love you bro, bro."
38,Love you more.
39,Goodnight.
40,Goodnight.
41,I can't believe I'm actually looking forward our a weekend away with your brother.
42,I'd pretty much given up on him but it really feels like Mina woke him up.
43,I don't know.
44,"He actually seems motivated, he's working, he's back in school."
45,"I don't know if I'd call two night classes, back in school."
46,"Well, she's definitely a positive influence."
47,Tell me how that relationship has any legs.
48,"She's, you know, I mean."
49,She's the whole package.
50,"Right, and then you have my brother, he's a barely employed Lyft driver, got kicked out of college, served jail time for nearly beating a guy to death, outside of his frat house."
51,"I'm just saying, I've never seen him like this."
52,"He really loves her, it's sweet."
53,"Yeah, of course he loves her, he hit the fucking jackpot."
54,"Oh yeah, it's a juicy one."
55,"Yeah, that's gross."
56,"Look at that, you want it?"
57,"No, I don't want it."
58,It's yours.
59,"well, I don't want that, it's yours now."
60,"Go on, keep it."
61,No.
62,You didn't just do that.
63,"Let me see, let me see your finger."
64,It's on my finger still.
65,"Let me see your finger, let me see it."
66,You fucking kidding me.
67,Hey.
68,"Dude, they said no pets."
69,"Just chill, it's gonna be fine."
70,"No, homeowners don't take this shit lightly dude, they'll turn us away."
71,"Oh yeah, it'll be hysterical when we drive across the entire state and have to turn right round."
72,"Josh Look, we'll hide him until the owners gone, all right."
73,It's gonna be fine.
74,Give him some love.
75,"What, no."
76,Give him a kiss.
77,No.
78,"You're gonna make him insecure man, seriously."
79,There it is.
80,"Good boy, Reg."
81,"This seems totally normal, right?"
82,Yeah.
83,Nothing that should set off any red flags.
84,"Except, not everyone is a racist prick."
85,"Mina, how many places have you booked through?"
86,One.
87,"Okay, well there you go."
88,"Yeah, but she got a five star rating."
89,How many places have we booked?
90,Three.
91,What?
92,It's still more than one.
93,"Oh, come on, it's the same house, same dates, her request gets denied and yours gets accepted an hour later."
94,"Look, discrimination obviously exists, and the name Mina Mohamadi, is about as Middle Eastern, as it gets."
95,"I'm just saying, why jump to that as the only possible explanation."
96,"Yeah, no, you're right."
97,"We should probably give, this white guy we've never met, the benefit of the doubt."
98,"Give everybody the benefit of the doubt, is what I'm saying."
99,"Yeah, no, that's groovy man, peace and love."
100,"Shit, are we here?"
101,Looks like it.
102,Will you hide your dog.
103,"You realize, if he barks, we are fucked."
104,He won't make a peak.
105,Not bad.
106,So nice.
107,He's gotta be around here somewhere.
108,Hello.
109,Whoa.
110,Holy shit.
111,"Oh, yeah, this will do."
112,Do you have the guys number?
113,"Yes, here."
114,"Oh, hey."
115,"Y'all just decided to let yourselves in, hah?"
116,"Sorry, I was just trying to call you."
117,"Yeah, I expected you an hour ago."
118,Is everything okay?
119,"Yeah, we just, we got a bit of a late start and then stopped for groceries."
120,"You must be Taylor, I'm Charlie."
121,"Yeah, that's me."
122,You own this place?
123,Why do you gotta say it like that?
124,"Oh, I didn't mean anything by it."
125,"Yeah, it's my brothers spot, I just take care of it, he's down in the Bay area, he never uses it."
126,"Well, we're hopefully on our way to owning a second home, we never use, too."
127,"This is my wife Michelle, that's my brother Josh and my partner Mina, my work partner, also happens to be Josh's girlfriend."
128,How'd you get mixed up with this family?
129,What do you mean?
130,"Oh, no, I didn't mean anything by it."
131,"Come on, let me show you rest of the house."
132,"Wow, this piece of shit, somehow exceeded my expectations."
133,"Yeah, no that's, fucking weird."
134,Can't believe we're giving this guy our money.
135, Babe.
136, What?
137,"Let's just, look we already drove, all the way out here all right, let's just enjoy ourselves, spend some time together and be outta here soon, okay."
138,"All right, set to blank, turn that thing and let me show you."
139," Oh, hey."
140, Hey.
141,Let me show you out back and then I'll get outta your hair.
142,Great.
143,"Wow, it's beautiful."
144,"Yeah, that's the thing, ocean."
145,The hot tub's over here.
146,Instructions are on the side.
147,"There's a bathroom through that door, on the corner there, towels, everything you need."
148, Oh nice.
149, Great.
150,"Yeah, it's nice getting in after dark, the stars are insane out here."
151,"Damn, I shoulda brought the telescope."
152,I thought about it and I totally forgot.
153,What do you need a telescope in the city for?
154,Unless you're like a peeping tom or something.
155,I got one you can borrow.
156,"If you promise to treat it right, I'll bring it on over."
157,"Oh, that's all right, I don't wanna put you out."
158,"No, that's no problem."
159,I shoulda had one here already.
160,That's my fault.
161,"All right then, I'll let you get to it."
162,"There's a welcome pack in the loft upstairs, you got my phone number, wifi info such, I'm just up the road, if you need anything."
163,"Otherwise, follow the check out procedures, when you go, and have a good, have a good weekend."
164,All right.
165,Thanks.
166,"Really appreciate it, thank you."
167,All right.
168,"Hey dude, are you the one who does the bookings for this place?"
169,"Yeah, I book this place."
170,"I tried to rent this house, for this exact period of time, but my request was denied, can you tell me why that is?"
171,"I don't know, a lot of people try to rent this place, I don't remember your request."
172,"Yeah, babe."
173,"It's just a little strange, 'cause my request was denied but then Charlie, a white man, put in an identical request, an hour later and his was accepted."
174,"We really don't have to get into this, right now."
175,"Mina Mohamadi, do you remember now?"
176,"If you don't like the house, or have any other problems, cancellation policy is listed clearly on the website."
177,"Outside of that, I don't have anything else to discuss with you."
178,"We understand, thank you."
179,Asshole.
180,Hey.
181,Wanna help me put away the groceries?
182,Yeah.
183,"It's a beautiful home, hah, bro, bro?"
184,"Crack a bruskey or twosky, gaze up at brorians belt."
185,"Sip a little Pinot gris, pop in a bromantic comedy."
186,"Oh, Broseph GordonLevitt all day, all night."
187,"Smoke a J, take a long walk along the brocean."
188,"Yeah, get that sand between your broes."
189,Prefect brome away from brome.
190,"Okay, that's enough."
191,A walk does sound nice though.
192,I wasn't kidding about that.
193,"After we put the stuff away, you guys wanna check out the property?"
194,Absbrolutely.
195,"Oh shit, Michelle, from way down town."
196,Come on.
197,Shit.
198,Come on.
199,Come on.
200,What you doing boy?
201,Jesus.
202,"God, that was good."
203,What the fuck?
204,"Creepy door with an electronic code, that's great."
205,Would have been extra creepy if that worked.
206,So dumb.
207,"Come on, they're waiting."
208,All right.
209,"They can be kind of intense, right."
210,Yeah.
211,"Don't worry, it gets less weird."
212,That's comforting.
213,"I'm constantly terrified, she's gonna leave me."
214,Why would you say that?
215,She's just so fucking smart and talented.
216,"And, you know, I just wanna be better for her and I wanna be able to challenge and inspire her but, I feel like, she doesn't even need that from me, she's already fulfilled in that way."
217,Makes any sense?
218,"Yeah, absolutely."
219,"Trust me, I hear everything you're saying and I think, what she needs from you is not for you to occupy the same space as her work partner, that's all he is to her."
220,"And I just think, you need to be loving and supportive, goes a lot further than you think."
221,"All right, so, you're cool with her occupying such a huge space in your husband's life?"
222,"I mean, no, fuck her."
223,"But yeah, yeah, they just have their creative thing going on."
224,I'm glad he has someone to share that with.
225, Hey.
226, I'm freezing.
227,You guys ready to turn back?
228, Yeah.
229, Yeah.
230,Chilly.
231,"Whoa, look what we have here."
232,Someones trying to get a five star rating.
233,"Oh, ooh."
234,"All right, I know we don't like the guy but I'm glad that we have this for the weekend."
235,Yeah.
236,"So, are you really just accepting that he's gonna come and go as he pleases?"
237,"Well, you know, he did say, he was gonna drop it off, tonight."
238,Couldn't leave it on the front porch?
239,You guys don't find this creepy at all?
240,Sorry.
241,Done talking about it.
242,Let's have a good time.
243,Who wants a drink?
244,Yes.
245,This looks incredible.
246,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
247,"So, what?"
248,"We'll just like head out, first thing in the morning?"
249,"Yeah, it'll take at least two hours to get to the waterfall."
250,Charlie's been making fun of me for buying a hydration pack just for this hike.
251,It is the nerdiest thing I've ever seen but I love you and I love that you plan ahead.
252,I get excited.
253,"So, what about tonight?"
254,"I mean, I don't know what kind of vibe we're going for but, Michelle, don't you have a little surprise for us?"
255,Tonight?
256,I was kinda thinking tomorrow maybe.
257,"Just, let's just show them."
258, Just get it.
259, Okay.
260,What's going on?
261,What are you guys up to?
262,I don't know what's going on.
263,What are you up to?
264,Sneaky Michelle.
265,What?
266,Oh my God.
267,"Oh my God, I don't think I've done this since the night we met."
268,Where did you even get this?
269,"Mina, he's told you the story of how we met, right?"
270,"Yeah, of course, I've been hearing for years that you just get a little ecstasy in this guy, turns into a dancing queen."
271,"There are pictures from that night where it just looks like, we're full on fucking on the dance floor."
272,"So, shall we do some drugs?"
273,"Shit, you guys, I really don't wanna be a downer but I might bow out early."
274,"It just, it was a long shitty week at work and I'm sadly fading kinda fast."
275,"Okay, well, you know, if you're not into it, we don't have to do it tonight, right?"
276,Yeah.
277,"Oh my God, no, no, no, please do it, I'm just, I know if I keep going, there's no chance I'm alive for this hike tomorrow."
278,Just save enough so we can all get sufficiently fucked up tomorrow night.
279,"Yeah, just like a little bit."
280,Yeah.
281,A little bit.
282,A little bit.
283,A little bit.
284,"All right, let's go, I got ya."
285,"Tap out, tap out."
286,"Josh, that's enough."
287,Tap out.
288,"Yes, winner."
289,Yes.
290,"Because of the earth's rotation, if it had hit a minute later, it would've landed in the sea and dinosaurs would still be ruling our earth."
291,Do you think cave people were afraid of asteroids?
292,Are you saying that 'cause you think cave people and dinosaurs lived together?
293,"Oh no, I mean, I know there was, you know, a time after dinosaurs before people."
294,"How long between dinosaurs going, and homo sapiens."
295,"You always do that, I'm not taking your quiz."
296,"No, come on bro, take a guess."
297,Fuck you.
298,"Good, you win."
299,"I'm getting another, you want anything?"
300,"I'm fine baby, thank you."
301,You're good?
302,Yeah.
303,What about you Reg you want anything?
304,You wanna take a look?
305,Yeah.
306,What are you doing?
307,"Being one of those big city peeping toms, people are always talking about."
308,You see anything?
309,One house with it's lights on.
310,Oh yeah.
311,Are people doing it?
312,Oh shit.
313,What?
314,"Somebody was watching, looking right back at us."
315,What?
316,No.
317,"I'm dead serious, look."
318,"Oh my God, is that Taylor?"
319,"Okay, the bid is over."
320,What the fuck is he doing?
321, Shut up.
322," No, I'm serious, he's got the fuck, fuck."
323,Fuck you.
324,Never attempt to outplay the player.
325,So glad we did this.
326,Me too.
327,It's gonna be a fun year right.
328,Yeah.
329,"We finally fucking did it, it's crazy."
330,I'm gonna go check on Josh.
331,"Oh, hey."
332,Come back out.
333,Hey baby.
334,Don't be in here alone.
335,It's so comfortable.
336,"No, come on, this is our vacation."
337,We never get to hang out like this.
338,"I know baby, I'm coming, I'm coming."
339,I'm coming.
340,Why'd you have to drink so much?
341,Told you to slow down.
342,Everything okay?
343,He's like out.
344,"Well, I don't know about you but I am getting in this hot tub."
345,"Oh no, I'm like annoyed now."
346,"I just, yeah, maybe I do wanna get in this hot tub."
347,I'm getting my suit and I'll meet you back here.
348,Okay.
349,Hydrate.
350,"Hydrate, hydrate."
351,How is it?
352,"Oh my God, get in."
353,Oh fuck.
354,Right?
355,With the fog rolling in.
356,So nice.
357,You know what's really nice?
358,These jets on my back.
359,I want jets.
360,Let me get some.
361,Trade me.
362,"Oh, this is unreal."
363,Can I tell you something?
364,You're getting us a hot tub for the office?
365,I think you're brilliant.
366,Thank you.
367,"You just make me so much better at what I do and you're funny and kind and you're just fucking great, and I'm just so happy to know you and work with you."
368,"If you're gonna get all loveydovey, I feel the same way about you."
369,"I feel like we have a real partnership, which I honestly didn't think was possible."
370,I always feel like people let me down.
371,"You just keep, not letting me down, it's weird."
372,Cheers.
373,Cheers.
374,"Now, give me those jets back."
375,No.
376,Share the jets?
377,Share the jets.
378,You getting some?
379,Yep.
380,Reggie.
381,Reggie come here.
382,Whoa.
383,What the hell was that?
384,I don't know.
385,"Maybe Reggie has the right idea, maybe time for bed."
386,Goodnight Charlie.
387,The dancing queen lives.
388,"Oh, barely."
389,You have fun?
390,"Well, come on, we gotta go, I don't wanna get stuck out there, in the dark, on the hike back."
391,Are you going?
392,"Sitting here, trying to decide."
393,"Come on, finish eating, let's go."
394,"I'm so tired, I don't think I'll be much fun."
395,Okay.
396,What?
397,"Nothing, it's just, you know, I don't remember much from last night, but I do kind of recall, someone giving me shit about missing out on fun vacation times."
398,"You know, something about how we never get to hang out this way, or."
399,Call it even?
400,"You know, I don't have to go, I can stay here with you."
401,"Can't ditch Michelle, look how excited she is."
402,"Well, Charlie and her can have their own day."
403,Don't think that's happening.
404,"I guess, I'm kinda stuck with this one, aren't I?"
405,"I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you, promise."
406,Can have a really fun night when you get back.
407,All right.
408,I love you.
409,I love you baby.
410,"Mina, Charlie let's go, time to change."
411,"You know what, I think Mina's gonna sit this one out."
412,"No, really?"
413,I'm hurting pretty bad.
414,"All right, well, it's your loss."
415,"Charlie come one, let's get going."
416,"No, don't give me that."
417,"Come on, let's go."
418,I'm sorry.
419,"Fine, well, you're cooking tonight and I'm getting fucked up."
420,"Yeah, okay."
421,"Josh, you ready?"
422,"Yeah, love you."
423,I love you.
424,"Oh and Reggie's still tied up out back, get him later in case Taylor pops by."
425,"Yeah, I'll grab him, baby."
426,Thank you.
427,Are you okay?
428,Not really.
429,How you doing?
430,What are you thinking?
431,We're smarter than this.
432,It can never happen again.
433,Yeah.
434,I mean it.
435,"Yeah, I'm with you."
436,I really do love your brother.
437,I know.
438,"Anyway, she ended up getting my number from Charlie and she texted me the punchline of this joke that she had totally butchered, from the night we met."
439,That's really cute.
440,What was the punchline?
441,Don't make me say it.
442,"You know, you and Charlie, you guys have like the best, how did you meet, story."
443,It is a pretty good one.
444,"Although, I can think of one person who thinks otherwise."
445,"What do you mean, who?"
446,"Wait, you know that when Charlie and I met, he and Jen were still together, right?"
447,Really?
448,"Wow, so, the ecstasy night, that actually."
449,"Yeah, he had a girlfriend."
450,Whoa.
451,"I know, it was not ideal."
452,I randomly think of her sometimes.
453,"She was a nice person, she didn't deserve that."
454,I wouldn't say she was totally innocent either.
455,What do you mean?
456,"I think she had a little of that same thing going on, with his previous girlfriend."
457,"What, like he was with someone when he met Jen?"
458,"Yeah, I think so, I don't remember all the details but there was this girl Zoe and then the Jen thing happened really fast, a little bit too fast, you know."
459,"No, I didn't know that."
460,Oh.
461,"Look man, I just meant, you shouldn't feel bad anybody Jen, you know."
462,It's fine.
463,"I don't even know what I'm talking about, this was like 10 years ago."
464,"It's okay, let's just keep going."
465,Hey.
466,They did pretty good.
467,"You can keep sleeping, I'll finish."
468,Charlie.
469,Tell me that's not a camera.
470,No fucking way.
471,I'm gonna call the cops.
472,"Wait, wait."
473,"What, where are you going?"
474,Fuck.
475,No.
476,We can't call the cops.
477,"What, why?"
478,It's all on camera.
479,"If we report this, then Michelle and Josh they could find out everything."
480,"So, what, we just let this fucking racist pervert, get away with it?"
481,"I don't know, I don't know, let me think."
482,"Ew, just thinking of him jacking off to it."
483,"I think, we pretend like it didn't happen."
484,What?
485,What are our other options?
486,"I don't know, threaten him to give us the footage."
487,I'm pretty sure threatening him is the best way to ensure that he shows Michelle and Josh everything.
488,Fucking kill him.
489,"Okay, clearly we can't stay the night, so, we just need to think of a reason to tell Josh and Michelle why we're leaving early, like, Taylor came by and said some racist shit or something like that."
490,"You know how protective Josh is, he wouldn't leave without confronting him."
491,"Yeah but, I'll deal with Josh."
492,"No, no, no, no, we start telling."
493,We'll figure it out.
494,"We start telling more lies, it just gets messy."
495,"Oh, come on."
496,It's gonna be okay.
497,"So, we do nothing, is that what you're saying?"
498,"He can't show anyone the footage, or else he gets caught, he's the only one who's ever gonna see it."
499,"We get through the night, we leave first thing in the morning, never happened."
500,"Hey, thought we almost lost you guys out there."
501,Someone got tan and sexy.
502,Oh yeah?
503,Yeah.
504,Did you have fun?
505,"Hey, missed you boo."
506,Is everything okay?
507,Yeah.
508,What's going on?
509,"You know what, let me get out of these clothes, hop into the shower and I will regale you with the heartwarming tale, that was our hike."
510,"Oh, you're gonna take a shower?"
511,"Yeah, can't you smell me."
512,"No, I don't know, I just, I get turned on by your mess."
513,Oh yeah.
514,Yeah.
515,Okay.
516,What's going on?
517,What do you mean?
518,"I don't know, are you okay?"
519,Where you and Zoe broken up when you started dating Jen?
520,What?
521,Where's this coming from?
522,Hello.
523,"I don't remember exactly how it played out but yeah, there may have been a situation where we hung out for the first time, while I was breaking up with Zoe."
524,"So, when you met Jen, you were definitely still with Zoe?"
525,"I think so, you know, but what is happening right now?"
526,"I was just thinking about us and the circumstances in which we got together, and I thought it was funny to hear that you have a pattern of doing this."
527,"Okay, so, this is a conversation you had with Josh, I assume."
528,What exactly did my fucking brother say?
529,Don't do that.
530,"No, it tickles me to think that Josh has been keeping such close tabs on my dating history."
531,I just wonder why you would've lied to me about it at the time.
532,"I don't think I lied to you, I don't remember the details."
533,Whatever I said at the time was probably true.
534,Migrate to the nesting beach.
535,"Okay, no, we're not doing this."
536,This is not how this trip is ending.
537,"We're gonna do drugs, we're gonna have fun."
538,"Mina, let's do it."
539,Sorry.
540,"But you guys should totally do whatever, don't let me stop you."
541,"Actually, you know, I think, I'm gonna sit this one out too."
542,"No, get up, get up, we said."
543,"Babe, what if we had a more mellow night, played some board games or something?"
544,"You know what, go ahead and waste your last night."
545,I thought we came here to have a good time and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
546,Where's the molly?
547,Don't tell me you guys finished it or I will fucking.
548,"It's on the side, by the bar."
549,There's plenty left.
550,You sure you wanna do this?
551,This was the plan.
552,"I went to bed early last night, so I can do this tonight, so, yes, I'm sure."
553,Okay.
554,Okay.
555,Reg?
556,"Hey, you guys, where's Reggie?"
557,"Baby, I'm so sorry."
558,"I was just so out of it this morning, completely forgot."
559,What's going on?
560,"Cool, good to know."
561,"No, no, no, no, no."
562,Reg.
563,Reggie.
564,"Okay, he's gotta be around here somewhere."
565,Fuck.
566,"Josh, it's all right, we'll find him."
567,Let's spread out.
568,What if he fell off the side of the cliff?
569,Fuck.
570,Reggie.
571,Reggie.
572,Reggie.
573,"Oh fuck, they lost the dog."
574,Reggie.
575,Reggie.
576,Reggie.
577,Reg.
578,Reggie.
579,Reggie.
580,Reggie.
581,Hey Reg.
582,Come on Reg.
583,Reggie.
584,Any luck?
585,"No, it's too dark, we got no phones."
586,"Hey, did you forget to turn off the hot tub, last night, it's broken?"
587,"I don't know, maybe."
588,"Well, whatever, I called Taylor."
589,"What, why?"
590,"Well because it's not working and I would like it to start working, so I can get in it."
591,"So, he's coming here right now?"
592,Yeah.
593,Who's coming over right now?
594,Taylor's coming to fix the hot tub.
595,"Babe, I wish you'd told me before you did that."
596,"He's just gonna come and go, what's the big deal?"
597,"I know, I just, I just know that Mina doesn't like the guy."
598,"It's fine, I'm fine."
599,"It's fine, she's fine."
600,"Hey, what if he took him?"
601,"What if who took, what?"
602,What is Taylor came by and saw Reggie?
603,You think Taylor took Reggie?
604,Maybe.
605,"Well, I just don't think he would agree to come by and help me, if he was holding your dog hostage."
606,"I guess, we'll see."
607,What are you gonna straight up ask him?
608,Yeah.
609,"I'm pretty sure he's gonna know that we snuck a dog into his house, if you ask him about it."
610,"My fucking dog is missing, okay."
611,"If he knows something, I'm gonna find out."
612,He's here.
613,Finally.
614,"Hey, evening buddy."
615,"Hey, where you at the house, at all, today?"
616,"No, not today."
617,"Yeah, I've been at my place all day, on the couch with my bottle."
618,Is that right?
619,That is correct.
620,Is that white girl here?
621,She called about the tub.
622,Did you take my dog?
623,What?
624,Did you take my dog?
625,"No, I heard what you said partner, I'm just trying to figure out why you got a dog in here, in the first place."
626,Why don't you just answer the question?
627,"No, didn't take your dog."
628,"Hey, hi, I called you."
629,"Full disclosure, I'm on drugs, I would just love to get in that hot tub as soon as humanly possible."
630,Thank you.
631,"She probably shouldn't be out there, alone with him."
632,"Baby, what are you thinking?"
633,I don't know what to fucking think.
634,What can I do?
635,"Let's just find Reggie, get the fuck out of here, all right."
636,What the?
637,"All right, hold on."
638,Yeah.
639,Yeah.
640,"Program was stuck in cleaning mode, should be good to go now."
641,"Oh, thank you so much, you're a lifesaver."
642,"Well, enjoy your final night."
643,Thank you.
644,"Stay with me, 'til it warms up."
645,Reggie.
646,"Come here boy, Reg."
647,Reggie.
648,Reggie.
649,Hey.
650,Hope you find your dog.
651,I got two of 'em myself.
652,"That whole, no dogs policy, is my brothers idea."
653,"Don't worry, I'm not gonna rat you out."
654,I know how to keep a secret.
655,"Well, if there's not anything else."
656,"Actually, can I show you one last thing, real quick?"
657,Yep.
658,"Oh, let me guess, it's that toilet hah?"
659,"Yeah, you gotta hold that flusher down, a lot longer than you think."
660,"I just want you to know that if you ever do anything with that footage, we go right to the cops."
661,Excuse me?
662,"We know, okay."
663,"Look, I don't really know what's happening right now, what are you doing?"
664,"Jesus, you gonna make me actually fucking do this?"
665,What?
666,What the hell is that?
667,"Dude, we fucking got you."
668,"Look, I don't know what scam you're trying to pull, but you go ahead and call the police."
669,Are you listening to me?
670,I didn't have nothing to do with that shit.
671,"I'm giving you a fucking out, we could've turned you in already."
672,"You know what, how about I call the police for you, hah?"
673,What?
674,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
675,"Hey, hey, hey."
676,That's not what I'm saying.
677,Reggie.
678,"Stop, don't be stupid."
679,You motherfuckers.
680,Baby.
681,"Josh, stop."
682,"Josh, that's enough."
683,Stop.
684,That's enough.
685,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
686,Come here.
687,"He was about to call the cops and I freaked out and it just escalated, I'm sorry."
688,"Fuck, fuck."
689,We're so fucked.
690,What are we gonna do?
691,What just happened?
692,You guys?
693,He was filming us.
694,What?
695,"I was taking a shower earlier and I saw something weird, like a camera, but I didn't know for sure and I just, I felt really scared, I didn't know what to do."
696,"And while I was dealing with that, you guys got back to the place and I was just gonna let it go."
697,"I was hoping it wasn't real, but then when Taylor came by, I couldn't hold back and I confronted him and."
698,It definitely was a camera.
699,And then Josh heard us fighting.
700,I fucked up.
701,"I'm so sorry, I should've just said something to you, I should've told you."
702,It's all right.
703,"Oh my God, did you find any others?"
704,"Yes, I'm fucking disgusted, he was watching us, but we have to call an ambulance."
705,What are we gonna tell him?
706,He beat him to a pulp.
707,"I'm sorry, Josh, there's no way around it."
708,He was attacking her when I came in.
709,"I know, but it's all on camera."
710,"Once they see that footage, I don't think the self defense argument is gonna hold up."
711,"He's a racist piece of shit who was filming us in the shower, all right."
712,I didn't do anything wrong.
713,"Go ahead, call."
714,I'm gonna check on Taylor.
715,It wasn't your fault.
716,"I was just trying to protect you, you know."
717,I know.
718,Michelle wait.
719,What?
720,He's not breathing.
721,"Fuck, fuck, fuck."
722,"Look, he was fine, just a second ago, right, I didn't even."
723,How did he even die from that?
724,What do we do?
725,What do you mean?
726,"I mean, like, what do we do, I don't know?"
727,We have to call the police.
728,We can't do that.
729,It's different now.
730,"Yeah, he's fucking dead."
731,"Exactly, the second we call in, they're sending Josh straight back to jail."
732,They're not gonna go easy on him.
733,Josh killed a man.
734,Are you grasping this?
735,This is actually happening.
736,"I know, I know, but I do not wanna see my little brother go to jail for the rest of his life."
737,There's gotta be something we can do.
738,Like what?
739,"I don't know, like what if it was an accident?"
740,What?
741,He had a shit ton of alcohol in his system right?
742,"Like, who's to say he didn't just, drunkenly stumble over the cliff."
743,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
744,"He had a few too many and he came to clean up the place after we left, and he slipped."
745,We are not having his conversation.
746,"Michelle called him from her phone, they can track that."
747,"Right, but the call logs don't actually prove that we ever saw him."
748,"I mean, there's a million reasons she could've called him."
749,This is fucking crazy.
750,"What about the footage, it's all on tape."
751,"I don't know, I guess we have to get to rid of it somehow."
752,The camera was wireless.
753,"Those things don't have that much range, the receiver's probably somewhere in this house."
754,No.
755,Babe this could work.
756,"I'm not saying we can't get away with it, I'm saying I don't want to get away with it."
757,"We will take care of everything, you wouldn't have to be involved at all."
758,"You're not listening to me, I'm not gonna live the rest of my life, knowing that we killed some guy and didn't do anything about it."
759,Three.
760,"I just came to say, we'll be outside."
761,"I won't say anymore, you had nothing to do with this."
762,I'm already guilty.
763,"No you aren't, you didn't do anything."
764,I didn't call the police.
765,"If we get caught, I'm an accomplice to murder, just like you and Mina."
766,We can say you weren't even here.
767,"Just go, go do what you need to do so we can get outta here."
768,"It'll be over soon, I promise."
769,This will never be over.
770,"Okay, okay, you ready?"
771,Yeah.
772,Fuck.
773,Fuck.
774,"Okay on three, one, two, three."
775,What the fuck are you doing?
776,"Josh, don't."
777,You crazy?
778,"I killed him, all right."
779,"I'm not letting you two go to jail 'cause I fucked up, just let me finish this."
780,"Baby, it's not worth it."
781,It's okay.
782,"All right, it's okay, just let go."
783,"Let go, it's all right."
784,Please be careful.
785,Go slow.
786,"Shit, use your light, mine's dead."
787,Josh.
788,Are you okay?
789,"You okay, J?"
790,I'm okay.
791,See you in hell.
792,Here.
793,Are you okay?
794,Jesus.
795,Let's just find that fucking footage.
796,"Stop, what are you doing."
797,Stop.
798,Stop the car.
799,Where are you going?
800,"I know, I know."
801,The worst part is over.
802,"Just one last, tiny thing."
803,I saw you.
804,"You saw, what are you talking about?"
805,You and Mina.
806,"Okay, listen, I fucked up, that was a huge mistake, it didn't mean anything."
807,"Baby, please, I'm so sorry, I'm so."
808,"I can't even fucking look at you, right now."
809,"Baby please, I'm sorry, let me explain, let me explain please."
810,"Will you look at me please baby, please."
811,Please.
812,"Okay, first off, where did you find the footage?"
813,Who are you?
814,"Wait, wait, wait."
815,"Hey, hey what just happened?"
816,Where's she going?
817,She hit her limit and she couldn't take anymore.
818,What does that mean?
819,Is she going to the cops?
820,"No, she just had to go."
821,"Wait, wait, wait, is she coming back?"
822,"Hey, how are we gonna get outta here?"
823,Hey.
824,"Look, this is not okay, Charlie, all right, stop being so fucking calm."
825,Everything is fine.
826,"Look, we just, we stick to the plan, we find the footage and then we figure out how to get outta here."
827,Fuck.
828,What the fuck?
829,"Guys, Michelle's in trouble."
830,"She's down the road, I'll be right back."
831,Babe.
832,Babe.
833,Michelle.
834,"Oh, thank God."
835,"Jesus, boo, you scared the shit out of me."
836,What do you see?
837,Just a bunch of boxes and junk.
838,It's gotta be here somewhere.
839,This is so fucked up.
840,Just help me look.
841,Are we sure we even know what we're looking for?
842,"A computer, hard drive, router, anything."
843,"Oh, Jesus."
844,"What, what is it?"
845,"Oh, you don't wanna know."
846,Anything?
847,No.
848,"Part of me expected to find a control room, a whole bunch of TV monitors, something."
849,It's okay.
850,Let's just keep looking.
851,I'm such a fucking piece of shit.
852,I don't know what the fucks wrong with me.
853,"You know, and I dragged you into this."
854,"No, you didn't."
855,We're gonna get through this.
856,I just need a minute here.
857,I'll be outside.
858,Baby.
859,Charlie.
860,Are you okay?
861,Not really.
862,What are you thinking?
863,"Hey, baby, can I show you something."
864,Did you find it?
865,"No, no, it's not that, I just got this weird text from Charlie."
866,What did he say?
867,Are you okay?
868,Not really.
869,What are you thinking?
870,We're smarter than this.
871,What is this?
872,I don't know.
873,It can never happen again.
874,"I mean, this is you and Charlie, right?"
875,"Yeah, I think so."
876,"I mean, yes, but I don't."
877,What can never happen again?
878,What?
879,"In the recording, you said, ""That can never happen again."" What were you talking about?"
880,What's going on?
881,How did Charlie get this photo of you?
882,Why the fuck is he sending this to me?
883,I don't know.
884,Don't look at that.
885,I'm sorry.
886,Charlie.
887,I'm gonna fucking kill you Charlie.
888,You gonna send me this shit and you're gonna hide?
889,Charlie.
890,Josh.
891,Come on in.
892,"There's a bathroom there, bedroom."
893,There's a beautiful view.
894,"Wifi, Cable."
895,Enjoy.
