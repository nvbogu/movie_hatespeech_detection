484,I know he's not. It's probably some jerk he put away.
485,But with the new boats and putting two kids through college...

487,I actually tried to persuade him to take money.
488,"Oh! Stop it, Riggs!"

522,"Rianne married one, he's her baby's father."
523,She's too afraid to tell Roger.
524,"They met, fell in love."
525,"She got pregnant, they got hitched."
526,And nobody's telling Roger about this?
527,"After the baby's born, Riggs."

611,"The way l see it, those are slave ships out there."
612,"And l'm freeing slaves, I'm freeing slaves..."
613,...like no one did for my ancestors. Okay?
614,"Riggs, it's my chance to do something and do it right."

626,"Okay, okay. What's the money for?"
627,"Hookers, drugs Contraceptives."
628,Can you believe they talk to their father like this?
629,Better than their parole officer.
630,CARRlE: lt costs more to go to school now.
631,"Me first, me first."
632,I get the tuition bills.
633,And the grades too.
634,Consider this a down payment on a future asschewing.

659,You look terrific.
660,Thank you.
661,Wait till she starts trying to raise that baby by herself.
662,"Daddy, l'll be fine."
663,Move back in and Grandpa Rog will be up all night with the baby.

665,"Well, you know, a cop or something."
666,True.
667,"Come on, guys. See you."
668,l should say goodbye.
669,"TRlSH: Hey, Lorna."

700,We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
701,Speak for yourself.
702,"We're making way for the new police: Guys with guns and psychology degrees, like Butters out there."

717,Heh.
718,Eh.
719,Lieutenant.

794,I wanted your advice.
795,I was thinking of Thinking?
796,Marriage.
797,"LAUGHS Marriage? The ""M"" word?"
798,"Does ""confidentiality"" mean anything to you?"
799,That's funny.
800,You know what would happen?
801,We'd go in my office...
802,...and you know what you'd tell me?
803,What?
804,"You'd tell me something like, ""Doc..."
805,"...l want to marry Murtaugh."" Or your mother maybe."
806,Or how about Nelson Mandela?
807,Nelson Mandela?
808,"Something to ridicule me, Riggs."
809,Something to get a rise out of me.
810,Listen carefully.
811,I'm not stupid.
812,And my time is reserved...
813,...for police officers with real needs and real problems.
814,Have you got that?
815,Have you?
816,Run it by me again?
817,No. And you know what?
818,I don't like you.
819,RIGGS: Stephanie?

825,But stop bothering me!
826,WOODS: You're disgusting!
827,What's the matter with you people?
828,What's shaking?
829,Captain Riggs.
830,Captain Murtaugh.
831,You're supposed to turn around and do that.
832,We're captains.
833,Heard you were up to your ass in Chinese.
834,The taller ones come up to the navel.
835,"They were short, but big enough to kick your ass. What can l do for you?"
836,"One of the ship's crew shot one of the illegals, apparently under orders..."
837,...and we'd dearly like to know who's smuggling Chinese these days.
838,"We got no hard evidence, but we're pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan."
839,MURTAUGH: Uncle Benny?
840,You know him?
841,RIGGS: Yeah.
842,Back when he was running smack.
843,We never nailed him either.
844,Benny's slippery.
845,Where's he hanging out these days?
846,"He's got a nightclub, couple restaurants."
847,He operates mainly out on North Broadway.
848,Here's the address.
849,"Hi, fellas."
850,MAN: Riggs.
851,There he is.
852,"Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers."
853,BUTTERS: Butters.
854,What you got on the freighter homicide?
855,I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.
856,They only knew the shooter by sight.
857,Checked out the boat.
858,Turns out the boat's registered under a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
859,"It'll be a rough one to crack, but we'll nail them."
860,You ever hear of Benny Chan?
861,Benny Chan.
862,No. What kind of bad man is he?
863,Real bad.
864,Big crime boss in Chinatown.
865,"If it's dirty and Chinese, Benny's doing it."
866,Where do l find him?
867,At this restaurant.
868,"I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog."
869,How about you?
870,"Since we're going there anyway, we'll drive you."
871,Chinese? Let me get my jacket.
872,"Riggs, not with him."
873,The kid's doing a good job.
874,We might need backup.
875,Spend time with him.
876,You might learn to love him.
877,Like a son.
878,A son?
879,ln law...
880,...enforcement it pays to know your fellow officer.
881,He might have to back you up one day.
882,"MURTAUGH CLEARS THROAT Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor to share some egg rolls with you."
883,"Yeah, all right. Let's go."
884,Share?
885,"Butters, it seems like you hate crime in a sort of personal way."
886,lf you don't mind me saying so.
887,"Why do you say that, sir?"
888,It's just last night I noticed you were more than slightly miffed.
889,"Wasn't he, Roger?"
890,"Yeah, yeah."
891,Any particular reason?
892,"About 1 50,000 of them."
893,That's how many bullets zinged around my neighborhood growing up.
894,Couldn't go outside.
895,Couldn't go near a window.
896,"Lived on the floor, ate on the floor, slept and watched TV on the floor."
897,I didn't learn how to walk till l was 1 0 years old.
898,Spent most of my formative years nosetonose with the family beagle.
899,"When I work on a crime, I ain't thinking about the crime."
900,"I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor, and it pisses me off."
901,Hey.
902,We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?
903,"No, why?"
904,Because he's following us.
905,Don't look too hard.
906,BUTTERS: Who's Leo?
907,Maybe it's a coincidence.
908,BUTTERS: What does he want?
909,l don't know. Let's find out.
910,"Yeah. Heh, heh, heh."
911,SIREN CHIRPS DRIVER: Fucking asshole!

916,"MURTAUGH: Yeah, we saw you."
917,"What you doing, Leo?"
918,I've been perfecting my tailing technique now that I'm a P.l. and all.
919,He's a private eyesore.
920,Nice inconspicuous vehicle. l like it.
921,"Riggs, who's the perp?"
922,What'd you bust him for?
923,l'm a perp?
924,"A young brother in back of a police car, automatically l'm a perp?"
925,Look at my suit! Look at my tie!
926,Do I look like the fucking Crips' accountant?
927,"Look at this badge, bitch."
928,Check out the gun.
929,"Okay, okay."
930,Put the gun down. Put the gun down.
931,License. Registration.
932,Urine sample.
933,"I got a badge too, okay?"
934,German Jews didn't have it any easier when we were kids.
935,So don't think you're the only one.
936,Okay?
937,"Besides, l knew you were a cop."
938,I was kidding with you.
939,I can smell a cop a mile away.
940,"Oh, l smell bad?"

946,Maybe we'll work together someday!
947,I'm the bomb! They'll tell you.
948,"We'll work together when I open a cereal shop, you leprechaun!"
949,"I didn't call you names, fuckface!"
950,Don't start!
951,Okay? Don't fool around!
952,These guys'll tell you everything.
953,"Sir, you're doubleparked."
954,"Officer, I'm just talking with the detectives."
955,We don't know this guy.
956,MURTAUGH: Yeah.
957,Think he might've been drinking.
958,They're kidding. Come back!
959,I wasn't drinking.
960,They just said that.
961,Blow your breath in my hand.
962,I can smell it already.

974,"Go this way, please."
975,"BUTTERS: They see us, but we can't see them."
976,Where's your green card?
977,That's a racist remark.
978,I'm a policeman who asked for your green card!
979,This is not the way.
980,You're the boss till we get up in his ass.
981,It'll be fine.
982,"Hey, they've refurbished."

984,"RIGGS: Hey, fellas."
985,"BENNY lN ENGLISH: Out, out!"
986,Can l get drink or food?
987,Uncle Benny!
988,I hope this is a bad time.

1010,"We found three bodies full of holes, so now it's a cop problem."
1011,Three dead Chinese?
1012,Billion more where they came from.
1013,"RIGGS: That's right, life's cheap."
1014,"Problem is, he shot at me and Rog too."
1015,That pisses us off.
1016,"Heh, heh, heh. Too bad they missed."
1017,But still I don't know anything about it.
1018,Hey. Who's he?
1019,Hey. He doesn't look too happy.
