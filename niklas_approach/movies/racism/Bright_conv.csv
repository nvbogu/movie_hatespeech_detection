0, Legend has it that the very first candy cane was created one Christmas by a choir master to help keep the children occupied during Christmas mass.
1,"The choir master curved the candy into a hook, which was meant to represent the handle of the staff of the shepherd."
2,"My grandma Carol loved that story, and it inspired her to make the greatest candy canes in the world."
3,upbeat music I can't believe the board is doing this to me.

38, I consult for major corporations.
39," I realize that working with a smaller company isn't what you're used to but this came across my desk, Gabe."
40,The board reached out to us.
41,They think that they're in trouble.
42,"Now, this is a unique situation and it requires a unique talent."
43," Oh, flattery?"
44,You're bringing out all the big tools.
45, Merry & Bright reminds me of what we used to do.
46,Working with smaller independent companies helping them achieve their goals.
47, Can they afford us?
48," Well, I think we'll work something out."
49, It's almost two weeks until Christmas.
50,Aren't they winding things down?
51," It's the Christmas season at a candy cane factory, Gabe."
52,I would say things are winding up.
53,It's the perfect time to go.
54,"Now, after your two weeks I'll need you to submit a preliminary report."
55,We'll take it up in the new year and see where we stand.
56,"And if you're feeling the holiday itch, I hear that the Christmas season in Britewell is quite lovely."
57,playful music  I don't even know where Britewell is.
58, Ohio.

106," Oh, yes."
107,That's what you were saying.
108, It might be nice to have a little companion that just doesn't talk about himself.
109," Well you can't really have a conversation with a dog, can you?"
110,"They leave fur everywhere, chew up shoes, yapping at all hours."
111, And I might like that.
112,"Joy scoffs  Well, what do I know?"
113,I've never had a dog.
114, Remember that adorable scruffy little mix at the rescue shelter I was telling you about?
115, Mm hm.

121,"Anyway, good things come to those who wait."

203, Right.
204,upbeat music  Yeah.
205,Just...
206,upbeat music I feel so silly.
207,I had no idea you were with Empire.
208," It's okay, we know who we are now and why we're here."
209," Although, I'm not sure how you can help."
210,It wasn't my idea for you to come here.
211," Well, it wasn't mine either."
212,playful music Think of me as your advisor.
213,playful music That's some big candy canes.
214," Well, we do make Britewell the candy cane capital of the world."
215, So I hear.
216, And with the last two weeks before Christmas it's our busiest time.
217,"Plus, December 26th is a big day for us as well."
218, The day after Christmas?
219, It's National Candy Cane Day.
220, I had no idea.
221," Well, now you do."
222, I'm more of a National Pancake Day kinda guy.
223,"Cate chuckles playful music So, what makes Merry & Bright viable?"
224," Well, our business model's been the same from the beginning."
225,"We're a seasonal company so, our busiest time's August through December and most of our business comes from contracts with regional and national distributors."
226, Just takin' notes.
227," I have some new ideas too but, these days I'm busy just trying to keep the place running."
228,As I'm sure you've heard it's my first year here as CEO.
229,I had to take over for my Grandma Carol who ran the place for 50 years.
230, You had to take over?
231,"So this, this wasn't your idea?"
232, Why don't we try some product?
233,Here you go.
234,playful music  Where's yours?
235, I do plenty of taste testing.
236,I'm fine.
237,playful music  Let's get right to the point.
238,You're paying more for sugar on average.
239,Why?
240," Well, we've used the same farm for over 40 years."
241,I figure if it's not broken  I guess that's my job to tell you that or not right?
242,"Cate laughs  Yeah, I think we're just fine in the sugar department."
243, Okay.
244,"Um, how 'bout your work force?"
245," Uh, well we employ about 40 to 60 people depending on the time of  Another way to save costs is to  Wait, wait, what?"
246,Lay offs?
247,Cut backs?
248, It's an option.
249,Last resort but it's an option.
250, I think we're good.
251," Listen, Cate, I don't mean to  Gabe, look, I'm just getting my feet wet around here, okay?"
252,I haven't had a chance to put my stamp on anything and no offense but I don't really need you here right now.
253," Well no offense back but I don't really wanna be here either, but it's my job and it looks like we're stuck together."
254," Look, I have meetings the rest of the day so uh, why don't we talk tomorrow?"
255,"Please, feel free to take a look around."
256,gentle music exhales gentle music  Hm.
257," I just don't think it's a good idea, him being here."
258, What's wrong with it?
259, He's suggesting things.
260, To improve the company?
261," Well, yes."
262, To help us out?
263, Yes.
264, And that's not a good idea?
265,"Cate sighs  He thinks our sugar prices are too high, that we should be getting it cheaper."
266, What's wrong with that?
267, Nothing.
268,"You know, Grandma Carol was loyal to our sugar producers for decades."
269,And he's already talking cutbacks.
270," So, you don't wanna lay anybody off and you don't wanna buy cheaper ingredients?"
271, No.
272,"I mean, I would prefer to consolidate our departments more efficiently."
273,"You know, maybe source some of our ingredients a little..."
274,Cate sighs Oh.
275,Maybe he's got some good points.
276,I just wanna see Merry & Bright get back to its full potential.
277, We all do.
278,Maybe you could use a little extra help.
279," Well, we did get off on the wrong foot."
280,"And maybe, maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt."
281, It can't hurt.
282,I bet he wants to believe in this company as much as you do.
283, Yeah.
284,All right.
285,Let's go find him.
286,I'll introduce you.
287," Maybe while he's here we can introduce him to the community, get to know some of the people, see the town."
288,I think he'd actually really like it.
289, It's a waste of time laughs.
290,This place is like a giant snow globe.
291,Live living in a slow time bubble.
292,"Sara, the whole business model is a dinosaur."
293,And Cate.
294,"There's like, there's talkin' to a wall, and then there's talking to a brick wall."
295,This might be an untenable situation.
296,I might have to rethink everything.
297," Gabe, you're my number one recovery expert."
298, I know.
299, The man with the Midas touch.
300, Even Midas would have a tough time in Britewell.
301,Rule number one in this business is you can't fix what somebody doesn't want you to fix.
302, Well then your day one report should be interesting.
303,I'm looking forward to it.
304, It's gonna be a lotta blank pages.
305," Gabe, I know you don't wanna be there."
306,I can feel that eye roll through the phone.
307,"You don't think a candy cane company is worth your time, but you might just surprise yourself."
308,You never know what you might discover.
309,"playful music  Oh, it's a lovely tree this year, huh?"
310,Cate?
311, Hm?
312, I said the tree's really nice this year.
313," Oh, yeah."
314,It's very festive.
315, Too many candy canes laughs?
316, They are my life now.
317,"I guess I should get used to 'em, right?"
318," Yeah, I know you wanted to do other things, but you made grandma's wish to keep the business in the family possible and I know how proud she'd be of you."
319, What do you think of the star?
320, Did your dad give you the star?
321, I called him last night.
322, It's very nice.
323,Yeah.
324,I also brought some of grandma's ornaments.
325, Cate Oh.
326, Mm hm.
327,"ornaments clattering  Oh, I remember this one."
328,"watch beeping  Oh, gotta go."
329," Oh, well is everything okay?"

333, At this hour?
334," Um, uh, yes."
335,"Uh, Jennifer is stopping by."
336,"She's picking up a fruitcake, a Christmas fruitcake."
337, You made a Christmas fruitcake?
338,You don't even like fruitcake.
339," Well, I'm turnin' over a new leaf."
340, A fruitcake leaf?
341," Yeah, exactly."

362,Thank you.
363,"Hey, what's up?"
364, You called to see me.
365," Yes, I did."
366,"Um, Sophie I have to talk to you about something."
367,It's important.
368, Okay.
369,Is Gabe stopping by the factory today?
370, Yeah.
371,Lookin' forward to it.
372,Like dental surgery.
373, Depends on the dentist.
374,"Oh, hey can I talk to you for a second?"
375, Yeah.
376, I noticed Pete's been online shopping for mountain bikes.
377,He left his laptop open.
378, Okay.
379, I think it's a Christmas gift for me.
380," Well, that's great."
381,You love biking.
382," Well, that's true but, I'm, why is he getting me a big gift when I'd be happy with the tiniest little laughs..."
383,Remember?
384,Christmas is the best time.
385," Well, why don't you just talk to him?"
386," You mean, tell him I want him to propose?"
387,"I, I can't do that."
388, No.
389,"No just, I don't know, feel things out."
390,See if you're both in the same head space.
391, I think he wants to.
392,I've tried to bring it up with him but he just changes the subject.
393, Maybe he's just nervous.
394, Maybe.
395,"I wanna talk to him about it but at the same time I need this to come from him, right?"
396, Do you want me to talk to him?
397,"I mean, I'd be happy to."
398, Would you?
399, Yeah.
400," I mean, not to put any pressure on him or anything."
401," Cate No, no, no, no."
402,Of course not.
403,I'll just see how he's feeling.
404,I'll find a time to talk to him.
405, That would be great.
406, No problem.
407, Good morning ladies.
408, Sophie Oh.
409, A little hot chocolate to start your day.

413,"Sophie laughs playful music Well, shall we get back to it?"
414, Yeah.
415,"Yeah, right this way."
416,playful music  Depends on the dentist.
417, You have a dentist appointment?
418, Cate No.
419," Okay, uh, let's talk about your company's strengths."
420, Yeah.
421,"Uh, Gabe before we get started, we got off on the wrong foot the other day, and the day before that laughs."
422,"So, for the next few days or however long you're here I'd like to get on the right one."
423, I'd like that very much.
424, Great.
425," So, low employee turnover."
426,That's a really good sign.
427," Yeah, I'm really proud of that."
428,We're a big family here at Merry & Bright.
429, Big family that loves makin' candy canes.
430, That's right.
431, Candy cane capital of the world.
432," Oh, you remembered."
433," Well, it's hard to miss."
434, Right laughs.
435,Gabe laughs Christmas is a big deal in this town.
436, I'm sensing that.
437,Cate laughs Gabe chuckles  So you spend your Christmases in New York I assume?
438," I, I don't really know where I'll be honestly."
439, Isn't New York home?
440," Yes, but I basically live out of a suitcase."
441,On the downside I travel a lot over Christmas and miss out on a lot of festivities so I really don't know where I'll ever be.
442,"You know, a few times I've even, you know what we should, we should be talkin' about business."
443, Establishing rapport is the key to any successful business relationship.
444, Fair enough.
445,I was gonna say that I've even spent Christmas Day at the airport.
446, On purpose?
447, Nothing says Christmas like moving sidewalks and luggage carousels.
448,Cate laughs But you know what?
449,I love what I do.
450, But everybody needs a home base.
451, One day.
452,"So, given your resistance to cutting costs in certain areas  Have I been resistant?"
453, Another recommendation would be to generate alternative product ideas.
454,Another way to cut costs is to increase potential profit.
455,"So, thank you for sending me this market research report."
456, I hired a marketing firm when I first got here.
457,Just to get a clearer idea of where we stood.
458, That's smart.
459,So national survey.
460,& Bright brand name.
461,"So, strong brand recognition."
462,"That's, that's good."
463,candy that you produced.
464,"Cate this, this is huge."
465,Do you guys have any other products in your lineup?
466, I might.
467," What is it, a secret?"
468," Well, if I told you I might have to give you one."
469,playful music  Deal.
470, Here you go.
471, What are these?
472, Barber Poles.
473,They're a replica of the original peppermint stick candy that was invented in 1837.
474,"It's uh, inspiration for what we know today as the candy cane."
475, Candy cane without the hook.
476, Yeah.
477,We stated making them as a nostalgic treat specifically for the Christmas Jubilee.
478, What is that?
479," Well, it's our big Christmas event here in town."
480,You probably won't be here for it but there's food and dancing.
481,The whole community really comes together.
482,"In fact, the Britewell Christmas season kicks off tonight with the tree lighting at the Old Mill."
483,I get to push the button.
484,It's my second time.
485," Oo, sounds like an honor."
486, It is.
487, Does Merry & Bright make any other types of candy?
488," Mm, Carol was a very strong willed woman."
489," Translation, stubborn?"
490, She knew what worked and she stuck with it.

1018, What's so funny?
1019, I thought you just said we leave Tuesday for New York.
1020, I did.

1023, Merry & Bright chocolate.
1024,Royce wants to see us right away.
1025,"I thought I, didn't I say something to you?"
1026,playful music Must've slipped my mind.
1027, That is some slip.
1028,I thought you would be going.
1029,You and Royce know each other so well.
1030," Well, it's your product, your company, and I am not a salesman."
1031," Sure but, I'm a little rusty on my pitch and presentation."
1032,"I mean, I've been out of the game  It's like riding a bike."
1033,You'll do great.
1034, I've never been to New York.
1035," Cate, this is a golden opportunity."
1036,Cate sighs  Bermax is such a big deal.
1037," Yes, it is."
1038,"And sometimes you just have to be bold, take a chance."
1039, What if he says no?
1040, Why say that?
1041, Because it's possible.
1042," Yes, but  What if I let everybody down?"
1043,"Merry & Bright, myself?"
1044,"I'm trying to honor my family's legacy, and I know the company needs to change."
1045,I just don't know what the right thing to do is.
1046, You can't win if you don't play.
1047,"If you don't wanna do it I'll let Royce know but, I need to know soon."
1048,gentle music Have a nice night.
1049,gentle music âª Cherish every good thing at Christmas âª  Oh no.

1055,I like 'em.
1056, Pete Thanks.
1057," So, I wanted to ask,  Hm?"
1058, How'd Sophie' Christmas present go?
1059," Oh, I spent over an hour in the jewelry store."
1060,I finally picked one but I wanted to show you a picture before I bought it.
1061," Oh, no, no."
1062,"Don't do that, okay?"
1063,"Just, you be confident."
1064,"This is your choice and your decision, your..."
1065,"Oh, it's a, it's an infinity symbol."

1070,Are you gonna ask Sophie to marry you or what?
1071,Pete sighs What?
1072," Cate, I'm not that clueless, I get what's going on."
1073, You certainly have a weird way of showing it.
1074, Part of it's an act.
1075, What do you mean?
1076, I'm scared Cate.
1077, What do you have to be scared of?
1078,She loves you.
1079, And I love her too.
1080,I'm crazy about her.
1081," Okay, then what's the issue?"
1082, What if I propose and she says no?
1083," That, that is not gonna happen."
1084, Proposals are such a big deal.
1085,"They take, take planning and, and thought and  Well yeah, but every proposal is different."
1086,"You know from the jumbotron at a basketball game to the, oh that was a very big example."
1087,"Don't, something smaller can be just as lovely."
1088,All right?
1089,"Maybe, I mean, is there a place that you two have special memories together?"
1090," Yeah, there is."
1091," Okay, good."
1092,"It's okay to be scared, just don't let it stop you from living your life or being happy you know?"
1093,"Be bold, take a chance."
1094,gentle music Where's Gabe?
1095, He was in the lounge last I saw him.

1114, I wanted to surprise you.
1115," Mom, I'm really happy that you're goin' back to the gym."
1116,"playful music I mean, I know you haven't been in awhile so it must be all kinds of new emotions you know?"
1117,Feelin' like a new person.
1118, Yeah.
1119, It's okay.
1120,"You know, when I get back from New York, why don't we go for jogs like we used to?"

1140,"That means you're excited, you care."
1141, You look calm.
1142," Well, looks can be deceiving."
1143,If I was to say I was calm I'd be lying.
1144, If you were to say.
1145, Were?
1146," Well, were is preferable to was when speaking in the hypothetical."
1147,School teacher mom.
1148," Look, one thing about Royce, he can be tough."
1149, How tough?
1150, Mr. Rutherford is ready for you.
1151,gentle music  I got your back.
1152,gentle music  Merry & Bright's cocoa confections would have extensive appeal in the retail market.
1153,Our goal is to capitalize not only on our loyal customer base but also on high end and high traffic clients as well.
1154,"Places like hotels, resorts, airports and specialty shops."
1155," So, I'm a little unclear."
1156,You'd like to make chocolates but you're a candy cane company?
1157," Yes, uh, this would be as a, as a year round alternative to our current lineup."
1158, A current lineup that just has candy canes?
1159, Correct.
1160,We're looking to diversify.
1161,"You know, in today's market I  Today's market has no time for companies with identity issues."
1162,People want a clean simple bite sized story.
1163,What's your story?
1164,Do you know who you are?
1165,"gentle music  Yes, yes I do."
1166,"We're Merry & Bright, family owned and operated for over 50 years."
1167,"We do one thing and we do it well, but sometimes that's not enough."
1168,I made these chocolates with Gabe from a trusted family recipe and we had a great time.
1169,"I think they're really special so, try 'em, don't try 'em, your choice."
1170,I'm fine either way.
1171,gentle music  All right.
1172,Let's give these chocolates a day in court.
1173,gentle music What's this one?
1174, Coconut buttercream.
1175,"gentle music  It's um, okay."
1176, Cate and Gabe Okay?
1177, It's okay.
1178,gentle music  Royce is hard to read.
1179,He'll give us a call back in a day or so.
1180,I thought you did really well.
1181, Thanks chuckles.
1182,It felt really good.
1183, I was worried.
1184,"You know, I brought you all the way over here and if nothing came of it then it would just all be for  It wouldn't be for nothing, Gabe."
1185,"You know, doing that pitch it not only reminded me of why I love business but, something about being in that room and pitching my grandmother's recipes, I just felt really connected to the company, you know?"
1186,Merry & Bright really meant something to me.
1187, That's great.
1188, Yeah.
1189,"And I'm in New York at Christmas time, you know?"
1190,Thanks to you.
1191," Yeah, you know what?"
1192,We are.
1193,"We get the rest of the day, why don't we make the best of it?"
1194, Okay.
1195,Any ideas?
1196," Yeah, I think I do."
1197, Okay.
1198, Follow me.
1199,gentle music  Wow.
1200,I can see why you love this toy store.
1201," Oh, I'd spend hours here as a kid growin' up."
1202,Dream of all the toys I would buy.
1203,Couldn't afford much back then.
1204, Oh.
1205," My mom, she worked three jobs when I was growin' up."
1206,Raised me on her own.
1207,And put herself through business school and then somehow found the time to get Empire off the ground.
1208,She started out helping small local companies and took off pretty quickly.
1209," Wait, your mom founded Empire?"
1210, That's right.
1211, So your mom is the CEO of Empire?
1212, Sara Carter.
1213,We're a family run business too.
1214," Well, I guess you can come in here and buy any toy you want now."
1215, And I do.
1216,"Gabe laughs Cate laughs Go ahead, pick, pick a few out."
1217,I donate them all to the Toys For Tots charity.
1218,They keep a hamper in the front.
1219," Ah, nice."
1220,"gentle music You know, Sophie would love this store."
1221,My mom would too actually.
1222,Although I can hear her now.
1223,She's gonna say you went all the way to New York and all you did was go to a toy store?
1224," Well, we got that party tonight."
1225," Wait, what party?"
1226, Oops.
1227," Wait, what, what party?"
1228, Gabe Musta slipped my mind.
1229," Gabe, we seriously need to work on this memory of yours."
1230,What party are you talking about?
1231,gentle music guests chattering gentle music Hi.

1237," Yeah, yeah."
1238,My mother does Christmas really well.
1239,I can't believe I finally made it back for one of her parties.
1240,"Cate laughs Gabe laughs Uh, Cate Merriweather, meet Sara Carter, CEO of Empire Corporate Recovery."
1241, Pleasure to meet you.
1242,We spoke on the phone.
1243, I'm so glad you could come.
1244, Your home is lovely.
1245, Thank you.
1246,I hope everything went well with the Bermax presentation today?
1247," Yeah, I think it went well."
1248, Good to hear.
1249,You two excuse me.
1250, Yeah.
1251,âª Have yourself a merry little Christmas âª âª Let your heart be light âª  What?
1252, I feel a little...
1253, Out of place?
1254, Yeah.
1255,"You know, if this was a date, now would be the time you'd ask me to dance."
1256, If this were a date.
1257,Were is preferable to was when speaking hypothetically.
1258, If I was speaking hypothetically.
1259,"âª From now on our troubles âª  Shall we, Miss Merriweather?"
1260," Hm, charmed Mr. Carter."
1261,âª Here we are as in olden days âª  So?
1262,Enjoying your first New York party?
1263, So far I like it.
1264,The dancing's nice.
1265," Well, dancing can get tricky."
1266, How so?
1267, It can get...
1268, Cate What?
1269, Nothing.
1270, You were gonna say it.
1271, No I wasn't.
1272," Yeah, it starts with an R."
1273, Relaxing.
1274," No, romantic."
1275, What?
1276," Yes, you were definitely gonna say romantic."
1277," Well, I never said it so we'll never know for sure."
1278,"Cate laughs Gabe laughs âª If the fates allow âª  You know when I was a kid, my dad used to bring me back posters from all of his business trips."
1279, Does your dad live in Britewell?
1280, He used to.
1281,He lives overseas now.
1282,My parents have been divorced about five years.
1283,"But um, this one time I remember he brought me back a poster of the New York City skyline."
1284,"I had it in my room and I used to lay in bed just imagining what it would be like to be in the center of all that, you know?"
1285,"All the lights, all the people."
1286,It's pretty enchanting.
1287,And now I'm actually here.
1288, Does the real thing compare to everything you imagined?
1289, Mm hm.
1290,âª Never near to us once more âª  I wanna show you something.
1291, Okay.
1292,âª Through the years we all will be together âª âª If the fates allow âª Wow.
1293,This place goes on forever.
1294," It's pretty cool, huh?"
1295, Yeah.
1296,Is this what you wanted to show me?
1297, Gabe What do you think?
1298, I think it's the least New Yorky thing I've seen since I've been here.
1299,Gabe laughs  You're probably right.
1300," Wow, that really reminds me of the Old Mill, with the pine trees and everything."
1301, Like the one we lit up.
1302, You lit up.
1303," I didn't wanna say anything but, when we first got to that tree lighting ceremony, I saw the barn and the trees, the whole atmosphere, the feeling in the place."
1304,It immediately reminded me of this.
1305, Cate Where is this place really?
1306, Nowhere.
1307,It's made up.
1308, How do you know?
1309, Because my dad painted it.
1310," Oh, your dad?"
1311," Yeah, a long time ago."
1312,It was a Christmas present hung in my room forever when I was a kid.
1313,I stared at it for what seemed like hours imaging a place this this.
1314,It seemed so magical.
1315,"You know, the colorful sky, the snowy pines."
1316,I had never been to the countryside as a kid.
1317,gentle music I just had to trust that it was there.
1318, And you found it.
1319," Yeah, I did."
1320,gentle music  Gabe?
1321,Gabe?
1322,"Uh, the McGuire's are here."
1323,"I thought you might want to  Thanks, great."
1324, Yeah.
1325, Well...
1326, Well...
1327, Well...
1328,Gabe laughs I think that's my cue to leave.
1329, Now?
1330, I have an early flight.
1331, Right.
1332," But this trip was, it was really special."
1333,Really.
1334,And quite inspiring even if the pitch didn't go our way.
1335," Yeah, we'll figure somethin' out."
1336, About the business or...
1337,gentle music It was a nice moment.
1338, I thought so too.
1339," But, let's call it what it was."
1340,It was a magical night.
1341,You live here and you travel all over the country.
1342,I'm in Britewell.
1343,"It, I'm really busy with the business right now  Cate I, I understand."
1344,You're not ready for a dog.
1345,Cate laughs Gabe chuckles  Right.
1346, Why don't I walk you out?
1347,Get you a cab?
1348, Okay.
1349, Okay?
1350, Yeah.
1351,gentle music phone ringing  Gabe Hello?
1352," Gabe, Royce Rutherford."
1353," Royce, let me guess."
1354,You tried more of the chocolates and you love them.
1355,"Royce laughs  No, but you know what?"
1356,My wife really loves them.
1357,And you thought I was a tough cookie.
1358,"Look, I'm gonna get straight to the point."
1359,"You know me, I go by gut instinct and I believe in relationships and you know I like you Gabe, and I like Cate."
1360,She seems really smart and together.
1361," Yeah, she is."
1362," As you know, we own and invest in a wide range of smaller food companies."
1363,"Cereal, pasta, vegetables, baking goods, but the one thing missing in our brand portfolio is investment in a startup chocolate company."
1364,I think Merry & Bright could become that chocolate company.
1365,"The infrastructure is there, and more importantly brand loyalty is there according to this market report you sent me."
1366,Thank you.
1367,Bringing in new machines won't be a problem.
1368,I have connections there and obviously we would hire the best chocolatiers.
1369,It's win win for everyone.
1370," This, this all sounds great Royce."
1371,What about the candy canes?
1372," Yes, Gabe that is a question."
1373,What about the candy canes?
1374,upbeat music dog barking  Come on good boy.
1375,Who's a good boy?
1376,Who's a good boy?
1377,Who's a good boy?
1378,Good boy.
1379,dog snarling upbeat music  Hey Cate.
1380,I talked to Bryan about the small batches and he said it's no problem.
1381,Should be done by the end of the day.
1382,Ingredients were easy to find.
1383, Great.
1384," Gingerbread, eggnog and sugarplum candy canes."
1385,It's perfect for the Christmas Jubilee.
1386, And perfect for our thank you gift to Bermax.
1387,You know what?
1388,Add the key lime and the French toast too.
1389,"And, let's make sure we find the nicest Christmas box we can for that okay?"
1390, Sounds good.
1391," My grandma Carol said,  Cate and Sophie always leave 'em with something sweet."
1392,Sophie laughs phone ringing keyboard keys clacking  Hey Gabe.
1393," Cate, I got good news."
1394,Royce loves the chocolate idea.
1395, What?
1396,That's great.
1397, Marry & Bright Chocolate Company.
1398,How's that sound?
1399," Uh, I'm sorry, wait, what did you say?"
1400, Merry & Bright partially converts to a chocolate company with Bermax as its major investor.
1401,"This, this is huge."
1402, But Merry & Bright isn't a chocolate company.
1403,We make candy canes.
1404," Well no, you'll still make those it just won't be the primary focus of the company anymore."
1405,"And who knows, if chocolates really take off you might not even need to make those at all."
1406,The key is you gotta get this going as quickly as possible.
1407,Chocolate is a year round business.
1408,This is exactly what you've been lookin' for.
1409," I, I don't know what to say."
1410, You don't have to say anything.
1411,Legal's drawing up the paperwork as we speak.
1412,"He's flying his assistant out tomorrow and, I'd really like to be there too."
1413,I feel like we did this together.
1414, Okay.
1415,"All right, bye."
1416,gentle music  A chocolate company?
1417,"But would, would you still do candy canes?"
1418," Yeah, but they just wouldn't be our primary focus anymore."
1419,I guess it helps us.
1420,I mean having Bermax as a major investor's pretty big.
1421,We'd still be called Merry & Bright but I...
1422, But what honey?
1423, Is it worth it?
1424,"I mean, you knew grandma better than anyone else."
1425,Did she ever wanna expand the lineup?
1426,Try out new ideas?
1427, Grandma believed in tradition but that is not to say that she didn't have some new ideas up her sleeve.
1428,"But maybe, just not enough time to realize them all I guess."
1429,gentle music  Whenever I look at the Christmas tree and that angel holding the candy canes.
1430, Joy Grandma's favorite.
1431," I just wonder you know, what would she think about all this?"
1432,gentle music  This is your company now.
1433,"This company's seen its ups and downs, but your grandmother was a fighter, and she believed in the product and in the way that it made people feel about Christmas."
1434,That's why we're still the candy cane capital of the world.
1435, But the market's changing.
1436,I don't know that seasonal's enough anymore.
1437,We need something year round.
1438,Complicates my decision.
1439, And maybe Gabe complicates your decision too?
1440,I can tell how you feel about him.
1441,gentle music  So?
1442,"If I were grandma, what would I do?"
1443," Everyone loved Carol, but honey you don't need to be her."
1444,You need to be you.
1445,gentle music  I think everything's in order.
1446,Has legal been over this?
1447, Yeah.
1448, Just sign there and there.
1449," Gabe uh, I'm really struggling with this."
1450, I understand.
1451, I hope so.
1452,I don't know if this is the right thing to do.
1453," Cate laughs, don't overthink this."
1454,It's a win win for everybody.
1455,You said you wanted corporate recovery and this is as good as it gets.
1456," Uh, first of all, okay?"
1457,It wasn't my idea for Empire to come here.
1458,"And second this, this is not recovery."
1459,This is a complete overhaul.
1460, This is a great deal for everybody.
1461, Is it?
1462,"I mean, how good of a deal is it if we lose who we are?"
1463," Cate  Gabe, I really thought that you knew what I was about, what I stood for."
1464,gentle music I thought you knew me.
1465,"gentle music  I, I guess I don't know what you want."
1466,Cate scoffs  No.
1467,"No Gabe, you really don't."
1468,gentle music  This is a mistake.
1469, A mistake I'll have to fix all on my own.
1470, She wouldn't sign?
1471,"Well, does this mean you'll be back in New York for Christmas?"
1472," I, I don't know."
1473," Well you're done with Merry & Bright, why stay?"
1474," You know I uh, I've decided in the new year I think I wanna start doing consultations for smaller companies."
1475,"Help them out, you know the way that you did when you first started."
1476, Oh.
1477," I have to admit, things didn't turn out the way I hoped they would."
1478,Apparently I still have a lot to learn.
1479," Well, you're still my number one recovery expert, and your ideas mean a lot to me."
1480,And this might be one of your best yet.
1481, Thanks mom.
1482, You're welcome.
1483,Gabe sighs gentle music  Mm.
1484,Mm.
1485,gentle music  Okay.
1486,gentle music  You're making me nervous Pete.
