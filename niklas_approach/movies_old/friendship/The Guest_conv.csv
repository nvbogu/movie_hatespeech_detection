420, What do you mean?

422,It's in the newspapers.
423,The police are looking for her.
424,How long before they find us?
425,You should've thought about that earlier.
426,"No, you should have done your fucking job."
427,It was supposed to be a random kidnapping.
428,She disappears.
429,Right?
430,Take her back to Pakistan.
431,Dump her in Karachi or Islamabad.
432,I leave it up to you.
433,Everything goes back to the way that it was.
434,That'll be a lot more work.
435,"Everything's fucking money for you, isn't it?"
436,Twenty.
437,"I'll give you 20,000."
438,You got the money here?

450,No.
451, What do you mean?
452, You killed someone.
453,It's in the newspapers.
454,The police are looking for her.
455,How long before they find us?
456,You should've thought about that earlier.
457,"No, you should have done your fucking job."
458,It was supposed to be a random kidnapping.
459,She disappears. Right?
460,Take her back to Pakistan.
461,Dump her in Karachi or Islamabad.
462,I leave it up to you.
463,Everything goes back to the way that it was.
464,I'm sorry.
465,You could say you never saw anyone.
466,You're dumped in Pakistan.
467,You don't know how you got there.
468,"Maybe they were gonna ask for a ransom, then they got frightened, so they decided to dump you."
469,"Or I can tell them that you kidnapped me, give them your description, and tell them that Deepesh paid you."
470,You don't think Deepesh will tell them you were in on the deal?
471,So I go back to my family and get married?
472,It's up to you.
473,"Heh. No, it's not."
474,That's the whole point.
475,I'll get you some food.
476,A whiskey.
477,"Hey, this is Jay."
478,"Hey, Jay. What's up?"
479,"I need some ID, man."
480,Is it for you?
481," No, for a girl."
482, Where are you? In London?
483,"No, I'm in India."
484, Is she British?
485, Indian.
486,"Oh, okay."
487,I know a guy who could help.
488,Where are you?
489,Delhi.
490,"He's in Jaipur, though."
491,That a problem?
492, Jaipur?
493, Yeah.
494,Okay.
495, How much is that?
496, Eleven thousand five hundred.
497,Have you got the 20K?
498, Yes.
499, All right.

504,Something expensive. A chain.
505,"Wait, why Jaipur?"
506,Just do it.
507, Hey.
508, Got you some clothes.
509,I need you to try one of those on.
510,Why?
511, I need to take a photo.
512, What for?
513,For your ID card.
514,Okay.
515,Looks good.
516,Stand there.
517,You should put your hair up.
518,Stand still.
519,All right.
520, Like it?
521, Yeah.
522,"You wanna get out of here, get some fresh air?"
523,Yeah.
524, Do you want some whiskey?
525, No.
526,You're drugging me now?
527,It's good for stress.
528,Is that why you're smoking it?
529,What was your plan?
530,Well...
531,Deepesh works in jewelry.
532,Gemstones.
533,That's his family business.
534,He told his family that he would go to India for a retreat or travel or something.
535,"Basically, be out of contact for six months."
536,"The family keeps the gems in a vault until they have a customer, and he had access to the vault."
537,So he made good copies of the stones.
538,Good enough to pass for real as long as they're not sold.
539,"The plan was that he brought them here, and we would disappear."
540,Live off the money by selling the stones.
541,Bold.
542, Hey.
543, We need to go.
544,Where?
545,Jaipur.
546,Not bad for 100 rupees.
547, Looks good.
548, No?
549, Do you guys have WiFi?
550, Yes.
551, I'll take one room.
552, Can I see your passport?
553,"Thank you, Mr. Sadik."
554,How many people knew about you and Deepesh?
555,No one knew about the plan.
556,"No one I told, anyway."
557,"Yeah, but about you and him being in love?"
558,"Our friends knew about us, but we kept it a secret from our family."
559,Why would they not want you to marry him? He's a rich boy.
560,He's not Muslim.
561,He's not from Punjab.
562,He's not from Pakistan.
563,He's Indian.
564,Can I see that?
565,I'm not going back without seeing him.
566,Hey.
567,"Excuse me, I'm looking for Nitin."
568," Yeah, that's me."
569, Sammy's friend.
570," Oh, hi."
571, Nice to meet you.
572, Come in.
573, Thank you.
574,Thanks.
575,How good are they?
576,"See, the Indian ID's okay."
577,It is a real person and she's dead.
578,"Good for hotels, jobs, police, maybe airlines."
579,Passport is rough.
580,Maybe okay for hotels and traffic cops.
581,Not for crossing borders?
582,Hmm...
583,"Maybe by land, late at night..."
584,with a bribe.
585,You want a visa for somewhere?
586,Pakistan?
587,Mm.
588,Yes.
589,"If you were a rich tourist, wanted to get away from it all in a nice hotel near here,  where would you go?"
590, Samode.
591,"Very isolated, quiet."
592,You would like it.
593, Where are you?
594, In Jaipur.
595,Do you have the money?
596,Yeah.
597,"Okay, pick me up at the Ghat gate in 30 minutes."
598, What color's your car?
599, Black Mercedes.
600,How the fuck did they get my name?
601,I guess they asked someone.
602,How would they not get your name?
603,Have you got the money?
604,This is only 10K.
605,"Yeah. Half now, half later."
606,I'm never gonna see you after this.
607,And you don't want to see me.
608,So that means I need all my money now.
609,All right.
610,I can get it by tomorrow.
611,Good.
612,Book a room at the Samode Palace.
613,Your hotel will know it.
614, Why?
615, Samira wants to see you.
616,Jesus. No.
617,She won't go back unless she's seen you.
618,No. No.
619,I need her to cooperate to get her back there.
620,You have to see her.
621,"Drop me here, and be ready to leave your hotel by 10 tomorrow."
622,And have the money.
623,Where have you been?
624,With Deepesh.
625,He'll see you tomorrow.
626,This is for you.
627,What's the plan?
628,I don't have a plan.
629,Can we go out for breakfast?
630,Sure.
631,We're leaving anyway.
632, It's good?
633, So good.
634,Have you been to India before?
635,Mm.
636,I love it.
637,Especially the south.
638,It's amazing.
639,Your parents let you come here?
640,When I was at uni.
641,With girlfriends.
642,What did you study?
643,Pharmacy.
644,"It's a good, solid job."
645,Then you went off the rails.
646,They went crazy first.
647,And then I went crazy too.
648,Get in the front.
649," Hey, baby."
650, Where the fuck have you been?
651,It's been a bit tricky.
652,I've been sorting shit out.
653,"Yeah, yeah. Sure."
654, Where are we going?
655, Samode.
656,"You're looking good, darling."
657,This life of crime suits you.
658,Bonnie and Clyde shit.
659, Have you got my money?
660, Jesus Christ.
661,"You are like a stuck record, man."
662,"Yeah, I got your money."
663,Can we talk in private?
664,Sure.
665, Pull over here.
666, No.
667,"I said, pull over now."
668, Now! Come on!
669," All right, all right."
670,Give me the money.
671,"Money, money, money."
672,Take it.
673,I'll leave you two lovebirds alone for a minute.
674,What's wrong with you?
675,Do you think I don't know what's going on?
676,Think I don't know what you've been saying to him?
677,What shit has he been feeding you?
678,"Oh, I know you."
679,"I know you're bullshitting me, okay?"
680, Tell me.
681, You need to go back.
682, No. No.
683," Yeah, you do."
684, The police are looking for me.
685," Oh, is it?"
686, Yeah.
687, Serves you right.
688, Serves me right?
689, What did you think?
690,"I get kidnapped, and no one would notice?"
691,No one would bother?
692,Like it's some student prank.
693,I just didn't think he was gonna fucking kill someone.
694,That's not my fault.
695,It's not my fault either.
696,You stupid fuck.
697,Motherfucker. Motherfucker.
698,"Paying extra to send me back to Pakistan to that marriage, like I'm some lost luggage."
699,I'll kill you.
700,I'll fucking kill you.
701,Don't fucking...
702,Don't fucking touch me.
703,"Cut it out, you dumb..."
704,Hey. Get the fuck out.
705,Get the fuck out!
706,Get the fuck out.
707, All right.
708, Shut the fuck up.
709,"Walk, man!"
710, She's fucking crazy.
711, Shut the fuck up.
712,She's fucking crazy.
713,All right?
714, Where are the jewels?
715, What jewels?
716,The stones.
717,What fucking stones?
718,Is that what she fucking told you?
719,And you believed her?
720,"Man, you are dumber than I thought."
721,I thought you loved her.
722,She's a fucking snake.
723,Come on.
724,She's pulling crazy stunts.
725,I liked it. It's exciting.
726,But she always has got an angle.
727,"Sounds like I shouldn't take her back to Pakistan, then, huh?"
728,Too much trouble.
729,You took the money.
730,Fuck.
731,Fuck!
732,Fuck!
733,Is he dead?
734,Yeah.
735,Are you gonna kill me?
736,I should.
737,Can I trust you?
738,No.
739,"Here's the deal, yeah?"
740,We split the jewels fiftyfifty...
741,get rid of Deepesh...
742,and go our separate ways.
743,Okay.
744,Let me see.
745,What's the plan?
746,We could put him in the car.
747,Drive it off the road somewhere.
748,It'll look like an accident.
749,They'll be still looking for me.
750,You got his passport?
751,It's in the car.
752,I'm gonna get some petrol.
753,You wait here.
754,Give me my bag.
755,Nitin. Sammy's friend.
756,"Yeah, I have something for you."
757,How much is this?
758,Where are we going?
759,We'll stay the night at the Samode Palace.
760,I'll be Deepesh.
761,We'll let people know we're going to Nepal.
762,Then we'll head south instead.
763,"Good evening, sir."
764," Please, have a seat."
765, Thank you.
766,I have a booking.
767,Deepesh Nayyar.
768,"May I have your passport, please?"
769,"Yeah, sure."
770,I'm going to the pool.
771,Okay.
772,Evening.
773," Good evening, sir."
774, Mind if I look at a map?
775," Yes, please."
776, Thank you.
777,If you could show me the best route to Nepal.
778,Whereabout in Nepal?
779, Kathmandu.
780, All right.
781,Hello. Housekeeping.
782,"Hi, can I have a sewing kit, please?"
783,There should be one in your room.
784,Where in the room?
785,"And to get down to Kathmandu, you have to go through Lucknow."
786,"I got it, thank you."
787,"Oh, no, thanks."
788,I'll do it. Thanks.
789,I bought a costume.
790,I thought we should look like we're on holiday together.
791,Where are you going?
792,It's time to leave.
793,Where are we going today?
794,"First stop, Jaipur, then on to Goa."
795,You should stay here.
796,I won't be long.
797,"No, I'm coming with you."
798,How much can I get for the car?
799,A thousand dollars.
800,And you can have these...
801,...for free.
802,But they need to be used first in Delhi.
803,"Then send them to Lucknow, use them there, then Kathmandu, then finish, okay?"
804,Okay.
805,Deepesh Nayyar? Mm?
806,And I have a stone.
807,We have a stone that we need to sell.
808, It's good.
809, I know a person.
810,"Uh, hold on."
811,Can we talk?
812, Okay. I'll leave you.
813, Thanks.
814,I need to make some calls.
815,Uh...
816, Where's the car?
817, Right.
818,"It's in the street, just outside the Bank of India."
819, Why are we selling the stones?
820, It's one stone.
821,We need money to live on.
822, What about the car money?
823, A thousand dollars?
824, Who is this guy?
825, He's good. He's good.
826,Have you got the stone?
827,Yeah.
828,Thank you.
829,"Yes, ma'am. Just give it."
830,It's diamond.
831,Ooh.
832,It's too rich piece for me.
833,What's he saying?
834,"He said, he..."
835,He don't have a buyer for this.
836,"It's more than $100,000."
837, I don't have any buyer for this.
838, Okay.
839,Thank you.
840,Take carefully.
841,Thank you.
842,Just a minute.
843,Where did you hide the diamonds?
844,In your dress or your jacket?
845,Guess.
846,Dress.
847,Correct.
848,Where?
849,Try and find them.
850,Cold.
851,Very cold.
852,Hot.
853,Don't you think we should put them somewhere safer?
854,Like where?
855,My wallet?
856,You might lose it.
857,I won't lose my dress.
858,Easy for you to keep an eye on it.
859,It's bright yellow.
860,You'll notice if I take it off.
861,Look.
862,Good plan.
863,"I have contacted the British consulate in Pakistan, and I have requested them to get involved."
864,Sounds like he wants you back.
865,I'm never going back.
866,How old were you when you left Pakistan?
867,I was 12.
868,Must have been tough.
869,Things were okay in Pakistan.
870,It was only when we got to England that it all went wrong.
871,"Listen, can I have some money?"
872,Why?
873,I want to buy a phone.
874,How much will it be?
875,If you just give me the 500 from the car?
876," If you need ID, use that."
877, Thanks.
878,Can I also have my British passport?
879,"Don't worry, I'm not gonna run away."
880,Where are we?
881,I don't know.
882,We've got about eight more hours before we get to Goa.
883,India's so huge.
884,So full of people.
885,A thousand million.
886,Everyone living their own life in their own world.
887,It's the perfect place to get lost.
888,We're like two needles in our Indian haystack.
889,I'm starving.
890, Yeah?
891, Can we get something to eat?
892,Yeah. You stay here.
893,I'm gonna rent a car.
894, Hello.
895, Hi.
896, I'd like to rent a jeep.
897, Mm.
898, How long would you like it for?
899, Two weeks.
900, But I... I might extend it.
901, Not a problem.
902," Can I have a license, please?"
903, Sure.
904,Thank you.
905,"Okay, so who are you today?"
906, Jatinder Shah.
907, Correct answer.
908, That's a new one.
909, Yup.
910,I can't wait to go to the ocean to swim.
911,We could go diving.
912,I love diving.
913, I have a confession.
914, What?
915,I can't swim.
916, No.
917, Yeah.
918, No.
919, Can't.
920,Heh.
921,Really?
922, Hahaha.
923," You can teach me, though."
924,"Yeah, I will teach you."
925,I'll teach you how to swim.
926," Hi, thank you."
927," Oh, hey, thank you."
928,Avocado salad and your omelet.
929, Thank you very much.
930, Thank you very much.
931,We're looking for somewhere to stay.
932,Where's the best place to start?
933,For how long?
934,I don't know.
935,"The winter, maybe."
936,"If you're looking for longterm, Maria has a lot."
937,"In the jewelry shop down there, by the beach."
938," But minimum, three months."
939, Thank you.
940,Thanks.
941,That sounds perfect.
942, Mm. Want some?
943, No.
944,Mm. It's good.
945,Hey.
946,Can I have the keys?
947,They've come to see the house.
948, Here.
949, Thank you.
950,Yes. So come in.
951,Have a nice view from here.
952,That's your dining place.
953,That's the kitchen.
954, And these are your keys.
955, Thank you.
956,"If you need anything, I'm here."
957,Have a nice day.
958, Thank you very much.
959, See you around.
960,"Come over, I'll bite you."
961,Does it hurt?
962,What's your real name?
963,Asif.
964,"No, it's not."
965, Look out.
966," Oh, fuck. Shit. Don't do that."
967,Don't do that.
968,Are you coming swimming with me?
969,I can teach you.
970,Tomorrow. Promise.
971,Okay. Tomorrow.
972, Come on!
973," I would, but..."
974,Samira?
975,Samira?
976,Samira!
977,Samira!
978,Excuse me.
979, How much is that?
980, Thirtyfive.
981,Hello?
982,I'm sorry.
983,Are you?
984,You can go back.
985,No one knows who you are.
986,I can't.
987,Thanks for the 5 grand.
988,I'll miss you.
989,"If you need anything, call me."
