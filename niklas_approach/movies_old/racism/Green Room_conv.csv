14,There's a skating rink about 11 miles from here.
15,Big parking lot.
16,Ice skating or rollerskating?
17,Just says they're open.
18,Why?
19,Hockey players whoop more ass.
20,"I don't know, dude. I've seen some pretty badass roller skaters."

30,"Uh, park in the side lot."
31,Rear doors tight to the walls so no one steals your shit.
32,All right.
33,Yeah?
34,These all have mushrooms.
35,This dude's legit.

52,"I'll do a print version for that, but this will run on our college station."
53,"Uh, if that's cool."
54,Yeah.
55,"So, you guys working on anything new?"
56,"Mm, yeah. A few songs."
57,"Maybe enough for, like, a seven inch."
58,Sweet. Will you actually press one?
59,"Yeah, if we can afford it."
60,"Yeah, no, I really dig the analog style."
61,"Uh, which brings me to the fact you guys are hard to find."
62,Why no social media presence?
63,"That's because booking more shows, selling more records would blow."
64,It's not hard rock.
65,"No one wants to starve, but..."
66,"when you take it all virtual, you lose..."
67,the texture.
68," What do you mean ""texture""?"

70,The music is for effect.
71,It's time and aggression...
72,Technical wizardry.
73,And it's shared live...
74,and then it's over.
75,The energy can't last.
76,Unless you're Iggy Pop.
77,"Yeah, well good for him, but I don't think I wanna be in my 70's still listening to Minor Threat."
78, But Tiger does.
79," I won't live to be 70, so..."
80,"Okay, so, uh, this is a good seg into one of my traditions."
81,"Uh, for each of you, name your desert island band."

104," Um, when is this gonna air?"
105,"Like, maybe we should plug the show?"
106,Yeah. Um...
107,My last show at The Muni Center didn't end well.
108,"Uh, lots of vomit, some fecal matter."
109,County commissioner got wind and pulled my permit.

126,"Yeah. We don't wanna go to jail, too."
127,I think you just ended this tour.
128,Fuck yes. Let's call it.
129,"All right, so we'd have to beeline to DC."
130,We have enough for one tank.
131,We'd have to siphon the rest of the way.
132,That's not a problem.
133,We got rice and beans.
134,We can head up north.
135,Take the 80 all the way.
136,"What the fuck you doing, man?"

153,"Uh, rightwing, or technically ultraleft, but not affiliated."
154, And your cousin's cool?
155," Yeah, yeah."
156,"Uh, don't talk politics, but stick with Daniel."
157,"I'd tag along, but he and his girl are coming here to crash."
158,Gotta vacuum and shit.
159,"So they're not, like, burning crosses or anything, right?"
160,"Like, we just play rock?"
161,"Uh, I'd play your earlier stuff."
162,Heavier stuff.

346,Cops are on the way.
347,"Above and beyond, gentlemen."
348,You need me to do it?
349, Nope.
350, Won't even be the first time.
351,Hurry up.

376, What about us?
377,What are you doing?
378,We're sorting it out.
379,"Just hang tight, Amber."
380,Your set was pretty good.
381,What?
382,What was the name of your second to last song?
383,Uh...
384,To... Toxic Evolution.
385,"It's fucking hard, man."
386,That's the one I did her to.
387,"All right, he's got six bullets..."
388, For real?
389, ...if we all go at once...
390," Guys, hold off a sec."
391, For what?
392, We haven't done anything!
393, It doesn't matter.
394,Okay.
395,They're called cartridges.
396,The bullet is the part that enters your brain if you keep talking shit.
397,"And this gun only has five cartridges, not six, 'cause they're big as fuck and only five fit the cylinder."
398,"So, please shut the fuck up and don't test me."
399,"Reece, you're making it worse."
400,We sit and we wait.
401,And we die?
402,Not if you sit and you wait.
403,It's just the one to 911 at 3:45 and then mine was at 3:47.
404,You called?
405, 911 called back and I answered.
406, Be clear.
407,Who else knows besides...
408,You said Daniel's cousin?
409,Tad.
410,"There was a text from him last night with our address, but he doesn't know anything."
411,"Except who they are, where they are..."
412,maybe where they're supposed to be next.
413,Fuck.
414,Check emails.
415,They played their set to the crowd.
416,Then we'll assume the wide world knows and they'll be tracking that.
417,Give it to me.
418,I was trying to buy some time and contain this until we could...
419,Contain?
420,It was pretty rapid fire.
421,I appreciate your initiative and we all love Werm.
422,He's a brother.
423,And you might have visited him in prison.
424,Makes a difference.
425,"Now we're all in the stew for an impulsive act, for a selfish act, under my roof."
426,You see a way out of this?
427,For them?
428,No.
429,We still have to find one.
430,Okay. This is good.
431,No guns.
432,"You have a ""No trespassing"" sign posted at the residence?"
433,"We got ""Beware of dogs."" That's better."
434,Does anyone even know we're in here?
435,No one who cares. Tad?
436, I think we go.
437, I think we go too.
438,The next person that moves...

450,Do not shoot them!
451,You know what?
452,That's on them.
453,Where are the cops?
454,Give them the gun!
455,Say again?
456,It's over!
457,Give them the gun.
458,"Okay, I told you they just tried to run at me..."
459,Then take the bullets out!
460,Just hand it over now!
461,Do not shoot them!
462,Is Darcy here?
463, He is.
464, I am.
465,"Gentlemen, I'm the owner."

470,Uh...
471,"thank you, but..."
472,"we open the door for the police, or we keep the bullets."
473,"Uh, the cartridges."
474,I've got no problem with that.
475,"Okay, I handed them the gun."
476,I'm gonna head out now.
477,"No, you're not."
478, Let him open the door.
479, Hang on.
480," No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun..."
481, Nobody is...
482,letting me do anything.
483,"I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?"
484, So how are we doing?
485, He's right.
486,"Pat, do the math."
487, Where are the police?
488, It takes a while out here.
489, Stay back.
490, Just want to make sure that no one else gets hurt in the meantime.
491,"Okay, I gave you the damn gun..."

550,"Like I said, they're pros."
551,They earn.
552,You'll be compensated.
553,Christ. How many people are on that list?
554,"It's 1,200 for a prospect, two for a bait dog."
555,"No studs, no champs unless you wanna pay This might cost you your livelihood, Clark."
556,"As long as it doesn't cost me mine, you're covered."
557,"There are gonna be cops, so clean up the residence."
558,Maybe leave a roach in an ashtray.
559,Put Daniel on that door and bring the van around.
560,Shit.
561,The keys.
562,"They're with them, I guess."
563,I don't know.
564,We need them.
565,I got a ton of shit to do.
566,Go on.
567,This is a fire hazard.
568,I wouldn't put Daniel on the door.
569,Fine. Plenty to do.
570,Where's Daniel?
571,He stepped out.
572,I'm covering.
573,Everything okay?
574,Meet me at the utility shed.
575,This a new ride?
576,Yeah.
577,Just turning it over.
578,I think it's getting choked.
579,Wrong filter.
580, She's a beaut.
581, What's up?
582,Need some of the squad.
583,Red laces only.
584, Tonight?
585, Now.
586,The list.
587,This is everybody who knows?
588,Yeah. Including the band.
589,Knows what?
590,Manageable.
591,"From here on out, not a single name gets added unless they have red laces."
592,There's 80 people in there.
593,You plus four.
594,Give Gabe the keys in case we have to play valet.
595,We're losing light.
596, You got it?
597, Yeah.
598,"Whoa, watch out!"
599,That could be asbestos.
600, It's not asbestos.
601," You don't have a phone, do you?"
602,They took it.
603,Hers too.
604,"I'm gonna search her, okay?"
605,Careful. That one could be a live wire.
606,It's a speaker wire.
607,What'd you find?
608,Uh...
609,"""Fleisch Wolf""?"
610,Uh... fleisch means...
611,"uh, flesh."
612,Or meat.
613,Like a fleisch salad.
614,It's German.
615,"So ""Meat Wolf""?"
616,Yeah.
617,This shit's solid.
618, Great.
619, There's nothing here.
620,Okay. Empty out your pockets.
621,"Come search me, faggot."
622,Just shoot him.
623,Come on.
624,Can I get up?
625,On the chair.
626,Slowly. Slowly.
627,Turn 'em out.
628,"Come on, man."
629,Other one.
630,Oh fuck.
631,Good call.
632,"Turn it out, for fuck's sake."
633,What is that?
634,Give that to me.
635,Hand it over!
636,Oops.
637,"Wait, was that a phone?"
638,"Oh, shit. Point it... point it at the door."
639, Point the gun at the door.
640, Maybe it's the police. It's a raid.
641, Are you serious?
642, Shh!
643," Fuck off, Ilsa!"
644," Yo, quiet, okay? Justin, don't move."
645, Point the gun...
646, Nobody move.
647, Now if we get all behind...
648, Nobody talk!
649,Careful now.
650,Smoke this.
651,Deal.
652,And if the cherry does something that you don't like...
653,shoot.
654,"Thank you, Amber."
655,Get comfortable.
656,Pretty smart for a Nazi.
657,I'm not a Nazi.
658,How do you fall for this shit?
659,Let's just say the people who were gonna hurt me weren't white.
660,Any of them women?
661,It's a problem where I grew up.
662, Guys.
663, What about tonight?
664,I think we got a white people  Reece: Guys! Shh.
665,"Oh, fuck you."
666,It looks like we tripped our main.
667,"Our backup gennie is fired up, but we're gonna to have to call it a day and do some troubleshooting."
668,We'll try again on Sunday.
669,No door charge.
670,"Hell, free drinks from 2:00 to 4:00."
671,"Those of you attending the racial advocacy workshop on Wednesday, assume it's on unless you hear otherwise."
672,And remember...
673,"this is a movement, not a party."
674,All right.
675,Stay safe!
676,Godspeed.
677,Who hasn't smoked yet?
678,"All right, you guys are gonna come with me."
679,You're not worried they'll talk?
680,They've got priorities.
681,Tell them the party is on us if they hole up for a couple of days.
682,Put this fire out first.
683,Grove Street?
684,My dope nigger stamps in case one of these meatheads gets booked for possession.
685,All right.
686,Let's get y'all somewhere safe.
687,Treasure?
688,Daylight. Underneath.
689,They're moving our gear.
690, Yes?
691, Gentlemen?
692,We're loading you out.
693,Are there cops here?
694,They've come and gone.
695,It got a little complicated.
696,We're so fucked.
697,"Uh, I'm getting hoarse."
698,Can you hear me if I speak at this volume?
699, Yeah.
700, Yes.
701,Good.
702,Um...
703,and can we please elect just one voice?
704,Yes.
705,"Okay. Now, you're trapped."
706,That's not a threat.
707,It's a fact.
708,"Well, we have a loaded gun."
709,That's also just a fact.
710,"Oh, we have plenty more guns on hand."
711,We just want you out.
712,Not harmed.
713,"Now, the firearm you have is not registered."
714,"I wanted it out of the picture before the authorities arrived, but you refused, so here we are."
715, Bullshit.
716, Yeah.
717,Here we are.
718,"Oh, I do apologize for my associates. They panicked."
719," Yeah, no shit! Man, we're..."
720, Listen! Listen!
721,No one is trying to wipe the slate clean.
722,Whatever you saw or did is no longer my concern.
723,You tell whoever you want whatever you want.
724,All I ask is that you understand you were held here for your own safety before you were released.
725,Okay.
726,Yes. Thank you.
727,But just...
728,just to be clear...
729,the police are coming back?
730,They've come and gone.
731,"Well, that's what concerns us, man!"
732,I just want that gun out of the picture.
733,Okay.
734," Careful, man."
735, Sorry.
736, What do we do?
737, We dig through the fucking floor.
738,While we just wait?
739,They could shoot us at any time.
740,"Yeah, but they haven't."
741,How do we even know that they have guns?
742,They have guns.
743,No question.
744,We're gonna trust you?
745, We've got zero leverage.
746, Ask for a phone...
747,for the gun.
748,All right.
749, What about him?
750," Yeah, I mean, the minute we give it up, what if he just, like, attacks?"
751,Then I'll wrap him up.
752,Okay.
753,So we see what they think?
754,Mmhmm.
755,All right.
756,"Uh, we'll give you the gun for a cell phone."
757,"Sorry, no."
758," Okay, well, how about a registered firearm?"
759, Funny.
760,"Justin, you alive and well?"
761, I'm alive.
762," Okay, good."
763,"Gentlemen, I hope you appreciate the situation."
764,"Things have gone south, no doubt."
765,"But you know if you don't hand over that gun, it won't end well."
766,You see...
767,"for all I know, I..."
768,I come to my place of business and there is an out of town band locked in a room with an unregistered firearm.
769," Oh, come on!"
770," And somebody's hurt inside there and maybe there's a hostage, too!"
771,So what do I do?
772,Am I within my rights to intervene?
773,Should I kick down the door and start shooting?
774,Or...
775,can we just remove the guns from the equation?
776,These are my questions.
777,"You've got Okay, hold on. Hold on."
778,Great. Anyone got any smart ideas?
779,"Justin, get on the floor."
780,Get on the fuckin' floor right now. Go.
781,"All right. Sam, come around here."
782," Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me."
783, Okay.
784, You got it?
785, Got it.
786,Okay. Nice and easy.
787,"Play nice, and I'll be nice."
788,Please.
789,Don't do anything.
790, This is fuckin' retarded.
791," No one's saying it isn't, but we either hand over the gun or we open fire with it."
792, I vote for that.
793," You don't have a vote, okay?"
794,"I mean we're taking chances either way, so..."
795,"So we're fuckin' dead, guys."
796,"At least this way, we find out if all we're doing now is buying time."
797, For them.
798, Amen.
799,"At this point, I'm just fucking curious."
800,Okay...
801,we'll give you the gun.
802,But we're gonna keep the ammo.
803,Fine. Safer for everyone.
804,"All right, let's move this fucking couch."
805,Okay.
806,"All right, keep still."
807,"Okay, stand back!"
808,You've got it.
809,Here we go.
810,May I approach?
811,No!
812,No. I'm gonna throw it.
813,Careful. It was a gift.
814, They're killing us!
815, Keep the gun!
816,Get the fuck off of me!
817,"Okay, okay!"
818,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"
819,Fuck you!
820,"Oh, my God!"
821,Keep it up! Pull it up!
822,Oh fuck.
823,"Yo, help me move the couch."
824,Help me move it!
825,"Oh, shit!"
826,"This will be over soon, gentlemen."
827,I'll fuckin' crush you.
828,Get the box cutter!
829,Get the fucking box cutter out of his hand!
830, Tell me when he's out!
831, Okay!
832,Pat! Pat!
833,"Look at me, look at me, look at me."
834,Shush! Shush!
835,Shush!
836,He's out. He's out!
837,"Oh, fuck."
838,Put pressure on it!
839,Put pressure!
840,"I know, I know, I know."
841,Just breathe.
842,Breathe. Breathe.
843,He's not out!
844,He's not out!
845,You got this?
846,How long does it take...
847,until we know... for sure?
848,What the...
849,"Oh, Jesus."
850,"Oh, Jesus."
851,"Any and all firearms, Clark will handle it from here on."
852,He give you an E.T.A.?
853,You said no calls.
854,Right. Good.
855,Phones too.
856,What happened in there?
857,"Set Neal up for tomorrow New drywall, pour a floor."
858,Tell him we had a leak.
859,"Door with a frame, too."
860,What happened?
861,"Uh, a bit of a maelstrom tonight."
862,Visiting band hurt one of ours.
863,Who?
864,Emily.
865,"Maybe Big Justin, too."
866,What the fuck are we doing then?
867,Let's get in there.
868,We're not coming apart is what we are doing.
869,We're saving questions until this pig fuck is transferred offsite.
870,Darcy.
871,Okay. Last chance if anyone needs to take a leak.
872,I lost the gun.
873,You held on longer than I would have.
874,Hey.
875,I'm going.
876,"There's no air shaft, there's no sewer system..."
877,no nothing.
878,There it is.
879,What time is it?
880,It's not daylight.
881,It's something.
882,Out the way.
883,"Oh, fuck."
884,Look for a door.
885,Just let me know.
886,Hey...
887,I'm sorry about your friend.
888,Shit!
889,"Okay, move."
890,Fuck!
891,Is there a lock?
892,"Other side, maybe."
893,We're burning time.
894,"Wait, but..."
895,Look! There's...
896,there's ventilation!
897,Six inch ducts.
898,Good luck.
899,Shouldn't we look around more?
900,We just did!
901,"Go. Go, go. Push."
902,Heroin.
903,It's not about her or us.
904,It's a... it's a big ass bunker.
905, Give me your hand.
906, Big ass dead end.
907,Give it to me.
908,"Hold it up, up, up."
909,"All right. Look away, look away."
910,Maybe we can use this to our advantage.
911,We're done.
912,I'm done.
913,Okay? You can close the door behind me if you want to strategize.
914, We're not ready!
915, What do you think they're doing out there?
916, That's just it. We don't know.
917, We fucking know they mean us harm!
918,"It's just that if have guns, okay, why haven't they mowed us down already?"
919,We can't just go missing.
920,They need us found.
921,All right.
922,Grab some shit and get ready to run.
923,Then we die.
924,"Yeah, but the longer we wait, the surer that is."
925," Tiger, you ready?"
926," Yeah, almost, man."
927,We can't take it so seriously.
928,We gotta...
929,treat this like paintball.
930,What?
931,Rick Silva...
932,helped organize the paintball for Skateo's bachelor party.
933,"And we were short a few players to book the whole field, so they paired us up with these exMarines."
934,"And the first few rounds, these guys just..."
935,tore us to shreds.
936,"I mean, zero casualties on their side."
937,And I just cowered behind these trees till I got shot.
938,Covered in paint. But Rick...
939,"Tiger, you done?"
940,Okay.
941,"Pat, you're done, too."
942,"I'm sorry, man."
943,We gotta go.
944,That's okay.
945, Was that a pep talk?
946, Ready?
947,"Now we won't all live, but..."
948,I don't know.
949,Maybe we won't all die.
950, Here.
951," No, I'm just gonna run."
952,I got it.
953,"All right, fuck it."
954,Simon and Garfunkel.
955,Desert island band.
956,Prince.
957,"I, uh..."
958, I'm still the Misfits.
959," True school, man."
960,Are we going?
961,Yeah.
962,Madonna and... Slayer.
963,Here we go.
964,Watch it!
965,What the fuck?
966,They're letting us out.
967,How many exits are there?
968,"Uh, the main, the back, maybe the kitchen."
969,I always...
970,What about windows?
971,See for yourselves.
972,Fuck.
973,Quiet.
974,"Oh, shit."
975,Should we hide?
976,"Uh, whatever you want, man."
977,We... we should split up.
978,Totally.
979,What the fuck?
980,Tiger!
981,Tiger!
982,"Oh, shit, oh, shit."
983,Shit.
984,"Oh, shit!"
985,Save it.
986,"Oh, shit."
987,Fass! Fass!
988,Voran! Fass!
989,Fass!
990,Hey.
991,They're everywhere!
992,Where's Reece?
993,It's us.
994,Come on. Move.
995,"Sam, look."
996,Fleisch Wolf.
997,It's a song.
998,"It means ""Meat Grinder."" Up! Up!"
999,So ist's brav.
1000,So ist's brav.
1001,You're retiring him?
1002,He's worked up.
1003,Send in another.
1004,Send two.
1005,Finish it.
1006,Kill that feedback first.
1007,"And if I send in two fight dogs, what do you think they'll do?"
1008,Send me in there.
1009,I'll finish up.
1010,Just give me the rules.
1011,All right.
1012,Blades only.
1013,Sloppy is fine.
1014,Try not to hit the bone.
1015,Okay.
1016,Take Jonathan.
1017,Brute squad.
1018,Keep him caged until we tag out.
1019,He breathing?
1020,"A little bit, yeah."
1021,Let him bleed.
1022,Later is better for time of death.
1023,Keys?
1024,No.
1025,They're coming.
1026,I can't do this.
1027,Get back!
1028,No!
1029,Where's Emily?
1030,What the fuck are you doing?
1031,Hey!
1032,Which one did it?
1033, Werm did it.
1034, Bullshit.
1035,Which one?
1036,What did they tell you?
1037,What? You want to know?
1038,You want him to know?
1039,Know what?
1040,Werm found out that she was leaving...
1041,but she didn't say that it was with you.
1042,"""Meat Grinder."" That song was their cue."
1043,You should go.
1044,Here we go.
1045,This is taking too long.
1046,Gabe?
1047,You didn't want Daniel on door duty.
1048,Why?
1049,"Nothing concrete, he and..."
1050,and Emily...
1051,Little lovebirds.
1052,Recognize this?
1053,"No, sir."
1054,Of course not.
1055,You were still handing out leaflets when these boys made their bones.
1056,It's from last Easter.
1057,Supposed to disappear after the boot party.
1058,He just started talking.
1059,Amber's alive saying Werm did it.
1060,Never mind that.
1061,You...
1062,Werm saved us all.
1063,Sam?
1064,It's okay.
1065,"I mean, it's not okay."
1066, You didn't know either?
1067, He's with us.
1068,Not where.
1069,We gotta split.
1070,"This has a wider duct, I think."
1071,We're not gonna fit through there.
1072,Oh!
1073,"Daniel, um, he can help."
1074,Why?
1075,Who's he?
1076,"A traitor. If they don't already know, they know now."
1077,I can get us out of here.
1078,Wow. A conspiracy.
1079,"No, just a clusterfuck."
1080,"There is still blades and fangs for the visitors, but we are getting lean on time."
1081,"Now, if you have to shoot, shoot once."
1082,"If more than once, keep it a tight grouping 'cause you'll be digging the slugs out yourself."
1083,"As for Daniel and Amber, they can..."
1084,What did we forget?
1085,There's a river on two sides.
1086,The quarry's on another.
1087,"We can parallel the main road back, go for help."
1088,"Well, how do we get past the door?"
1089,I know something you don't.
1090,Good. What?
1091,I know where we keep...
1092,Too slow.
1093,Should we go?
1094,Now?
1095,We have the gun.
1096,I guess.
1097,Yes.
1098,Yes!
1099,Give me two.
1100,Easy! Not her!
1101,Don't fire!
1102,Fass! Fass!
1103,Fass!
1104,Go!
1105,Sam!
1106,Sam!
1107,We're never getting out.
1108,Fuck.
1109,"You know, I'm lucky."
1110,I guessed at least they were gonna shoot me.
1111,"Three'll do, gentlemen."
1112,The fourth can disappear.
1113,It's time to start the cleanup.
1114,I'm gonna need a push broom.
1115,This is supposed to have happened already.
1116, Time to sprint.
1117," Yes, sir."
1118,Well done.
1119,Thank him.
1120,Nearly got away from me. Us.
1121,Shouldn't we be panicking?
1122,I'm hungry.
1123,I can't die here with you.
1124,So don't.
1125,"You know, feel free just to..."
1126,"Hey, I want the rest of your pep talk."
1127,"Oh, no."
1128,It no longer applies.
1129,"Oh, come on."
1130,I'm curious.
1131,It was paintballing...
1132,you were cowering...
1133,"Yeah, Rick Silva."
1134,We were getting slaughtered by these legit Iraq vets.
1135,It totally applies.
1136,"Full camo, thousanddollar automatic paintball guns."
1137,They knew real war and they played real war.
1138,"Tactics, hand signals, flanking."
1139,Just wiped us all out.
1140,"So Rick gets fed up and says, ""Fuck it."" Didn't care about getting shot."
1141,Didn't care about taking cover.
1142,"It was hopeless, man."
1143,"So the last match, the whistle blows, and he just tears out there, full jackass, in..."
1144,in sneakers and cutoffs and he... wipes out their whole team.
1145,Doesn't stop.
1146,Just keeps running and laughing and shooting...
1147,until they're all dead.
1148,Pretend dead.
1149,And we're up against real guns.
1150,Yeah.
1151,"Either way, we can't play real war."
1152,Let's pretend.
1153,For you.
1154,We're just mopping up tonight.
1155,You already earned these.
1156,"Maybe push Neal, depending on the mess, to start looking for a new house band."
1157,We've really gotta get back to a routine.
1158,You think Cowcatcher's gonna talk?
1159,I'm more worried about their habits.
1160,Really have to stay away from that nigger dope.
1161,There's a bad batch doing the rounds.
1162,We're good to go.
1163,We're set.
1164,This all hinges on nothing having happened here.
1165,"Now, let's be clear."
1166,This should keep him alive for another hour.
1167,I would consider it a personal favor if he dies with meat in his teeth.
1168,Come on. Come on.
1169,"Bite command is ""fass."" It's all you'll need."
1170,Disregard. Just shoot who is left.
1171,They don't have to be accounted for.
1172,Forensics is no longer a concern.
1173,"We call this in late, all is for naught."
1174,You guys got any 12 gauge?
1175,Not in the office.
1176,Try the bar.
1177, How many shots you have left?
1178, Three.
1179,So you have one extra.
1180,No shells.
1181,Behind the bar.
1182,Better get started.
1183,Shit!
1184,Easy! Easy!
1185,Easy!
1186,No buckshot!
1187,What's happening?
1188,Dog freaked.
1189,And turn this shit off!
1190,I tried! It's not coming from our mixer.
1191,Go! We got this.
1192,And don't tell Darcy.
1193,Or Clark.
1194,We going?
1195,Yeah.
1196,Hey!
1197,"Down there, you dipshit fashion punk clown motherfuckers!"
1198, Turn around!
1199, Shazbot!
1200,What? What...
1201,Who is that?
1202,Odin himself.
1203,Give me the shotgun.
1204,"No, I got the shotgun."
1205,Then you go down this fucking hole.
1206,Three shots?
1207,Yeah.
1208,"You hear me fire twice, you come down no matter what."
1209, This is a trap.
1210," Yeah, no shit."
1211,You wanna go tell Darcy?
1212,He's gonna be pissed.
1213,Watch my back.
1214,Fuck this.
1215,"Get Gabe, man!"
1216,We need two down here and one up there.
1217,Who's got the nine?
1218,"I think Alan does, but I'm not sure Oh, fuck! Block it!"
1219,Pat!
1220,He's got three shots left!
1221,Bitch.
1222,Gabe!
1223,Amber!
1224,Yeah?
1225,Uh...
1226,never mind!
1227,Two shots left!
1228,Nice fuckin' try!
1229,Go fuck yourself!
1230,Shit. Shit.
1231,"Oh, shit!"
1232,Pat!
1233,One shot left!
1234,Fuck.
1235,Zero.
1236,"Oh, shit!"
1237,Get off of me!
1238,Got him.
1239,Totally.
1240,Flabbergasted that motherfucker.
1241,If I had any idea...
1242,Anymore dogs?
1243,People?
1244,No. Not here.
1245,They're... up the road.
1246,I don't want to go to jail.
1247,Does anyone know how to hotwire a car?
1248,No.
1249,I'd stay off the road anyway.
1250,Are you gonna shoot me?
1251,Where's Werm?
1252, We sent him home...
1253, Stay quiet till we're out.
1254,It's the residents.
1255,What are they doing?
1256,Something you don't want to see.
1257,We can call the cops when we get to the orchard.
1258,Did you see them die?
1259,Two.
1260,Not the third.
1261,I think I'm going.
1262,You can call the cops when you get there.
1263,"If you disappear, I'll find you."
1264,I will.
1265,I promise.
1266,"You should go, too."
1267,Just hedge our bets.
1268,You got three rounds...
1269,and I've seen you pump a shotgun.
1270,Fair enough.
1271,Do you believe him?
1272,Shh.
1273,Nimm futter!
1274,Nimm futter!
1275,Nimm futter!
1276,Nimm futter!
1277,Nimm futter!
1278, Jesus.
1279, Nimm futter!
1280,That ought to be enough.
1281,Lass es! Lass es!
1282,Lass es!
1283,So ist's brav.
1284,Aus. Aus.
1285,Wipe it down!
1286,Do you think they'd leave the engine on?
1287,Yeah. It'll run the gauge down too.
1288,Let's call this in.
1289,Aus. Aus.
1290,You got the dog?
1291,I got the dog.
1292,Tie him up.
1293,Give me your gun.
1294,I don't have one.
1295,I'll shoot you either way if you don't hand me one.
1296,Throw it.
1297,They're making it our fault.
1298,You were trespassing.
1299,It looks fishy to me.
1300,The cloth is to make it seal.
1301,I wouldn't do it like that.
1302,They got my gun.
1303, Shut up.
1304, Listen...
1305,So we're doing that?
1306,Why else would we walk up here?
1307,I don't know.
1308,And I was gonna...
1309,ruin the crime scene.
1310,Oh.
1311,I thought we'd leave a new one.
1312,This...
1313,is a nightmare.
1314,For us all.
1315,Tell me those stupid fucking words are his last.
1316,Do you have a phone?
1317,It's funny.
1318,You were so scary at night.
1319,We need the police.
1320,"Okay, I'm the Ain't Rights from Washington, D.C."
1321,"Uh, technically, we're from Arlington."
1322,"Nice. Uh, and this is for Seaside HCFM."
1323,"Yeah, if we can afford it."
1324,"Yeah, no, I really dig the analogue style."
1325,"Uh, which brings me to the fact that you guys are hard to find."
1326,I know what it is.
1327,What what is?
1328,My desert island band.
1329,Tell somebody who gives a shit.
