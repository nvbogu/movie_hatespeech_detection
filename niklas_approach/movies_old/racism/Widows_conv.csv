1,"Thank you, madam."
2,Madam.
3,"Pardon me, madam for trespassing in your estate and intruding in your privacy."
4,What do you want?
5,I come to deliver a confidential letter.
6,"This is very important, Madam."
7,Madam Sonia if you should ever meet Count Danilo let me tell you he is terrific.
8,What is this? Count Danilo?
9,Terrific?
10,That's what people said.
11,Danilo? Danilo?
12,"Yes, Count Danilo."
13,"Now, Madam, this is absolutely between you and me."
14,This Count Danilo is crazy to meet you.
15,He tried everything.
16,"In fact, he's desperate."
17,"I really feel sorry for the man, but you're such a widow."
18,"Pardon me, Madam, what I mean is you live in complete seclusion and the poor man has no chance to meet you socially."
19,"Well, I'm very sorry."
20,I never heard of the gentleman and I'm not interested.
21,"Oh, you will be, Madam."
22,The man is in such a state of man there is no telling what he may do.
23,Who is this Count Danilo?
24,Me.
25,Who wrote this letter?
26,I.
27,I don't understand.
28,What do you want?
29,An answer. Yes or... when.
30,If you don't leave immediately I shall report you to the king.
31,"Oh, please, please."
32,Let me stay only a little while and you may recommend me to the queen.
33,It's hard to believe that an officer of the royal guard...
34,"Dares to approach the richest, most powerful woman in the country..."
35,And behaves like a silly young cadet.
36,It's an outrage.
37,"Now, don't get excited, please."
38,I am...
39,"Unjust, that's what you are."
40,Put yourself in my position.
41,Imagine you saying all those lovely things to me and me wearing your mask.
42,Won't you spend sleepless nights wondering what I look like?
43,"Well, my situation is much worse."
44,I haven't slept for months.
45,Then I think it would be very wise if you leave immediately and go to bed.
46,And dream about you.
47,"No. No. You're cruel, Madam."
48,You're torturing me.
49,"Day by day, I've been watching you when you're riding your carriage in the street."
50,I come up here every night.
51,I suppose I'll have to call my servant.
52,They're all bribed.
53,Do you know I've been feeding your dogs with the finest imported salami just to get quite a glimpse of you and what do I see?
54,"Your lovely little hands, your dainty little feet and yet the most beautiful thing."
55,Stop it.
56,Tell me. You're eyes.
57,Are they blue or brown?
58,Are you pretty or beautiful?
59,Gorgeous.
60,No. This is no time for joking.
61,I have been in many situations but this is too much.
62,There's not a window in Marshovia that I haven't jumped out.
63,I've got around every kinds of band but here I'm block. By what?
64,By your piece of flimsy material.
65,"Oh, please. Have mercy."
66,"Leave the veil between us, Madam."
67,Be a nice girl.
68,"My dear Count, I'm very sorry to be the cause of your suffering."
69,"But, no... I..."
70,"But unfortunately, we are in Marshovia and I am a widow."
71,Why don't you throw away this old custom of ours?
72,And take off my veil.
73,Yes.
74,"I'd do it in a minute if there is any reason for it or the slightest temptation, but there isn't."
75,Maybe you can't see me very well?
76,"Oh, yes. In fact, too well."
77,I'll admit you're very funny but not terrific.
78,Not even carousal.
79,"Madam, I want you to understand once and for all."
80,Our romance is over.
81,Don't count on it any further.
82,I've tried to bring the moonlight into your eyes but you pull down the shade.
83,"Alright. Forget me, if you can."
84,Go back to your solitude.
85,Put on your loveliest negligee and wish yourself good night.
86,"And please, don't include me even in your dreams, will you?"
87,Good night.
88,Well? I'm afraid not again.
89,"Come, Muska."
90,No more salami.
91,"A night in romance is underlying done, in vain through my window the moonlight is drawn."
92,"Oh, Viria, oh, Viria, oh, yes, that's my tune."
93,I love the shepherd who run for the truth.
94,"Viria, oh, Viria, don't leave me alone."
95,"My little, my little love to you."
96,"Viria, oh, Viria."
97,"I'm waiting for love, lonely without thee was I."
98,"Viria, oh, Viria, don't leave me alone."
99,Love goes to love and my heart is your own.
100,"Viria, oh. Viria, don't leave me alone."
101,Lonely with only my song.
102,Lonely without thee.
103,"Good night. Good night, madam."
104,"Oh, just a minute, before I forget. Melissa?"
105,"Yes, Madam."
106,"Would you ask the secretary to find out the address of a certain, ah, of a certain, ah, what's his name? Count Danilo."
107,"Oh, Count Danilo lives in Queen's Avenue."
108,"No. 25, second floor, apartment B Thank you. Never mind."
109,That's all.
110,"Good night, Madam."
111,"Good night, Madam."
112,"Good night, Madam."
113,"I thought that this day could be the day when my heart would find your love, your love again."
114,I thought that this day would be the day and my heart would learn to dance dance again.
115,It was all just a fleeting dream.
116,"Men are not, not what they seem."
117,And this beautiful day only taught me to regret but tonight will teach me to forget.
118,"I lay await, he's forgetting me."
119,It was just not meant to be.
120,"And so it is, I must close my book on dreams and I sealed it with regret and forget."
121,"Madam Menosca. Yes, madam."
122,"My new dress. Yes, madam."
123,Get everything ready.
124,"We're going to Paris tomorrow, tomorrow morning, as soon as possible. Yes, madam."
125,There's a limit to every widow.
126,"The melody of laughter flowed many times that it flows here many times Pretty lover, your pearls and your lavender, soon will enlighten the eye of each cavalier."
127,Around a lei of roses and glances and he glances like romances once again I meant to be melody of love in Paris in the spring.
128,Who is it?
129,"It's your suspenders, your Majesty Any news, your Majesty."
130,Conditions are bad. Terrible.
131,What do you hear?
132,"Well, you see, your Majesty."
133,"After all, we're a sheep and cow country."
134,Who's complaining now?
135,The shepherds.
136,Ah.
137,I overheard two shepherds in the street yesterday.
138,What did they say?
139,"Now, tell me..."
140,"The opinion of the shepherd on the street, that's what I want to know."
141,They say when the richest woman gets fed up in the country and leaves.
142,Ah. So they're blaming me for everything.
143,They're even telling jokes about your Majesty.
144,Are they funny? That's bad.
145,"If conditions don't improve, the shepherds are going to organize They say there's already some talk of black sheep movement."
146,Were they prominent shepherds?
147,Couple of East side shepherds.
148,Intellectuals? Yes.
149,Let them talk.
150,"Are you staying out late tonight, darling?"
151,You ought to know how it is these cabinet meetings.
152,Do you think it will last all night?
153,"Now, please don't bother me."
154,Too enough to have a widow in Paris to worry about without having a Queen in bed nagging me.
155,Widow. Widow. That's all I hear.
156,A king worrying about a widow.
157,Not a widow. The widow.
158,The richest widow in the world.
159,In Europe.
160,"Well, anyhow, she owns more than half of Marshovia."
161,Do you realize that she is in every cow in the country for 52 percent?
162,"But you belong to me, don't you, darling?"
163,Read this telegraph from our ambassador in Paris.
164,Widow sensation in Paris.
165,Fortune hunters are arriving daily. Marriage in the air.
166,"Unless Marshovia acts quickly, fear national fortune goes into foreign hands."
167,I know what to do but am too old to do it.
168,"Darling, how late do you think you'll be denied?"
169,"Now, let me pump this into your head."
170,You and I are living on her taxes.
171,"If she doesn't come back, if she withdraws her money from the country, the National Bank will close."
172,The country goes bankrupt.
173,There will be a revolution.
174,Then we'll be trampled from our throne.
175,Ugly. Something must be done.
176,Something will be done.
177,And tonight. This is a secret.
178,The cabinet figures that we have to meet foreign competition.
179,"Therefore, we're sending a special envoy."
180,A real man who is not too old.
181,And knows what to do.
182,Of course.
183,"The man must be charming, irresistible."
184,So she falls in love with him.
185,And he brings her back to Marshovia.
186,Who are you going to send?
187,"Well, we're considering Count Gabrilovetch."
188,Gabrilovetch?
189,Now tell me.
190,"If you weren't married, if you weren't my wife, could you fall for Gabrilovetch?"
191,"If I weren't married, if I have to do over again and have the choice between you and Gabrilovetch, frankly, I'll take you."
192,That shows you how I think of Gabrilovetch.
193,He's out.
194,Who else have you got?
195,"Well, there's Gabrilovetch, Jerjosh and Mentroloski."
196,I'll still take you.
197,"Oh, you'll have to do better than that."
198,"That's what I say, but the Prime Minister, he depends too much on his wife's judgment."
199,But I say no politics at a time like this. Let the best man win.
200,That's what the meeting is for.
201,I'm expecting a real fight.
202,"Darling, do you think it will take you all night?"
203,And I could have married the sultan's daughter.
204,"Good night, dear."
205,"Please, I beg of you."
206,Control yourself.
207,"And you, too."
208,"I never shriek, your Majesty."
209,Walls have ears.
210,You think your servants hide anything?
211,Oh. My good name.
212,"Your Majesty, may I make a suggestion?"
213,What is it?
214,Let's fool them.
215,Let's make a rich conversation.
216,Let's pretend to be social.
217,Right.
218,"I'll take my hat off you, your majesty."
219,We're having a good time.
220,Fine. Fine.
221,That's enough.
222,Let's not make a big win.
223,"That'll settle the servant problem Now, let's keep this scandal between you and you and me."
224,This must be kept out of history.
225,Not a soul must know.
226,"Nobody. I swear, not a soul."
227,"We were planning not even to tell your majesty, isn't that right?"
228,That's the spirit.
229,"Now listen, you."
230,Be careful.
231,A firing squad is too good for you.
232,"Tonight, you'll be taken to the mountains."
233,"First, your ears will be cut off."
234,I'll attend to you later.
235,"Yes, master."
236,"No. No, Dolores. That's not right You know well enough that I have to go down in history as Augment the Great."
237,And how do you cooperate?
238,Falling in love with the Captain of the Guard. Oh.
239,That's hitting below the crown.
240,"You're wrong, Augment."
241,You're wrong.
242,I didn't fall in love.
243,"I was defending myself and splendidly, but you came back too early."
244,You didn't give me a chance.
245,"If you have return an hour later, you'd have found him where he belongs, outside the door."
246,How does he compare with Gabrilovetch?
247,"No comparison, but Gabrilovetch, Zinchovitch together and what have you?"
248,"Gabrilovetch and Zinchovitch, but Danilo, no, no comparison."
249,Dolores.
250,"Yes, Augment."
251,"With my brains and your contacts, Marshovia can't miss."
252,Afraid of me?
253,Ever live in Paris?
254,"Oh, I spent all my holidays there, your majesty."
255,Oh. So you know Paris.
256,"Do you want some other lass, your majesty?"
257,No. No. I'm a married man.
258,Are you married?
259,"No, your majesty."
260,You don't know what you're missing.
261,"Don't I? No, you don't."
262,"Your majesty, may I make a suggestion?"
263,Please.
264,Let's drop the matter.
265,"Fine. Now listen, my good fellow You will leave tomorrow for Paris Oh, thank you, your majesty."
266,On a secret mission that's right up your boulevard.
267,"Please, your majesty."
268,How is your French?
269,Terrific. (French) Not bad. What does it mean?
270,"Oh, I was just saying something about her majesty the Queen."
271,Was it nice?
272,"Lovely, isn't she."
273,Marvelous.
274,You will leave immediately.
275,"Yes, your majesty."
276,"As soon as you arrive in Paris, you will report to the Marshovia embassy."
277,"Our ambassador, Baron Bafbaf will tell you the next move."
278,"Your majesty, whatever my mission will be, Marshovia, right or wrong, I'll never forget your face when you walk into that room."
279,Did I frighten you?
280,Oh.
281,"Goodbye, my majesty."
282,"Goodbye, my boy."
283,What's new?
284,I overheard two girls on the streetcar.
285,They were talking about you.
286,What did they say?
287,They were telling stories about you.
288,Were they funny?
289,"Well, they must have been."
290,"You see, I don't understand French but the conductor did, so he stop the car and throw them out."
291,That's Paris.
292,City of girls on their own private.
293,I'm going to Maxim's.
294,"But aren't you going to report to the embassy, sir."
295,Tomorrow morning.
296,I'm going to Maxim's.
297,"But, sir."
298,"I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are queens."
299,Each kiss goes on the wine list and mine is quite a fine list.
300,"Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo, Mango, Crucru."
301,We promise to be faithful until the night is through.
302,"A melody of laughter, loud and many times, that is laugh with many times."
303,"My dear, my friend, my lover and you soon will enrapture the eye of each cavalier."
304,"Yes, ma'am."
305,I'll be ready in a moment.
306,"Thank you, madam."
307,"Around a lei of roses, wine and dances, manly glances, sideway glances."
308,"Once again, I will..."
309,Gentlemen?
310,"Yes, madam."
311,What are your plans for the evening?
312,"We'll go to Cait d'Pate to dine, then to the opera."
313,We should get there at nine.
314,Then a late supper at the Grand Hotel.
315,"When it's midnight and all is well, then we'll dance, if you're willing."
316,"How mad, how wild, how thrilling."
317,"I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are queens, Each kiss goes on the wine list and mine is quite a fine list."
318,Close the window.
319,"Oh, why don't you..."
320,"I'll stay on at Maxim's until the morning beams, when I am feeling so good be sure I'm out for no good."
321,"Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo, Mango, Crucru."
322,"Wake your young man, please do."
323,Come on.
324,Don't spare the horses and drive me to Maxim's.
325,Where is he going?
326,What did he say?
327,I think he said Maxim's.
328,He's going there it seems.
329,I heard that's where a man can see ladies dance the cancan.
330,"Lolo, Dodo, Juju, or any name will do."
331,True love is on a thousand and the best one goes to Maxim's.
332,We can't go to Maxim's.
333,Not in my wildest dream.
334,There's nothing shown there and we are too unknown there.
335,"Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo, Mango, Crucru, we promise to be faithful until the night is true."
336,Danilo.
337,Lulu.
338,Count Danilo.
339,Lulu. Please.
340,Did you say something?
341,No.
342,You better not.
343,Are you looking for trouble?
344,No Good.
345,What if I am looking for trouble?
346,"Oh, shut up."
347,I won't shut up.
348,"Go home, you old fool."
349,Pig.
350,Idiot.
351,Stop. How dare you?
352,"My seconds will call on you, monsieur."
353,"Very well, monsieur."
354,I wouldn't bother.
355,"Now, listen."
356,Who is that old goat?
357,"He's some ambassador from, ah..."
358,You understand.
359,This whole thing is a government secret of the highest importance.
360,"Yes, your Excellency."
361,"Well. Tomorrow night, the embassy is giving a big reception in her honor."
362,Does she see well off?
363,No. No. No. No.
364,Is she beautiful?
365,She owns fiftytwo percent of Marshovia so she is beautiful.
366,"If you like her or not, you love her."
367,This is called patriotism.
368,Have you ever had diplomatic relations with a woman?
369,"Oh, well. Anyhow, these are the plans for tomorrow night."
370,"Before you arrive, she must have a very dull time, so that you can shine by contrast Therefore, for the first half hour I will entertain her personally."
371,After listening to me for she will be completely bored.
372,"Then we dance, after five minutes dancing with me, widow needs fresh air."
373,Exit to garden.
374,"Now, and now, she gets the big thrill."
375,I leave her.
376,She's alone in the garden.
377,It'll be a moonlight night.
378,I'll see to that.
379,"I mean, it'll look like it."
380,"And the next thing, you come over the garden wall."
381,Danilo. Danilo.
382,How are you? How are you?
383,"Oh, fine."
384,Danilo.
385,How are you?
386,Danilo. Danilo. Danny.
387,Danilo.
388,Stay here or I'll kill you.
389,I don't like her.
390,I once have a wonderful girl.
391,Girls. Girls.
392,It's good to be back.
393,"Mimi, Gigi, Pipi, Fufu."
394,Do you still have that frightful chauffeur?
395,With all the cushions.
396,"Good. Juju, Dodo, Miji, I gained five pounds."
397,They're all mine.
398,And Margo.
399,Margo with the same sweet dimple.
400,How's your young lady?
401,Still grouching?
402,A ha.
403,"And Gaches, are your garter still blue?"
404,Baby blue.
405,Do you still cry when you love somebody?
406,"Did you miss me, girls?"
407,Yes.
408,And I miss you.
409,"All of you, Mimi, Kiki, Fufu."
410,"Oh, it's great to be loved."
411,Just a minute.
412,Don't stand in the entrance.
413,Go over to table fifteen.
414,Order lots of champagne.
415,Any Americans here tonight?
416,I don't know.
417,"Peculiar, ha?"
418,Bother?
419,Look who's here. Danilo.
420,There are girls in the wild and its wet.
421,There's two things that we live to regret.
422,Let me dance till the restaurant's close.
423,"With the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls."
424,Where there's wine and women and song.
425,It is wrong not to do something wrong.
426,"When you do something wrong, you must do something right."
427,And I'm doing it right tonight.
428,I say.
429,"Oh, terrific."
430,"Remember, last year?"
431,Do I.
432,Oh.
433,"Pretty, isn't it?"
434,He gave it to me.
435,Not bad. Who's she?
436,She's new here.
437,"What's your name, deary?"
438,Fifi.
439,"Well, Fifi."
440,Who is he?
441,Don't you know me?
442,She doesn't know me.
443,You don't know him?
444,No.
445,It's Danilo.
446,Danilo? Wait a minute.
447,Aren't you the man who gave me this bracelet?
448,"Oh, listen."
449,"If I gave you the bracelet, you'd remember it."
450,"And besides, he doesn't give any bracelets."
451,Shall we sit down?
452,"Well, there's not much going on here tonight."
453,You're Americans.
454,Are you a banker?
455,No.
456,I was just in a mood for banker.
457,"You understand, don't you?"
458,Sure. Sure.
459,I didn't mean to hurt your feeling.
460,It's alright. Really.
461,Not bad. Come on.
462,Sit down. Waiter.
463,"Yes, madam."
464,Lots of champagne.
465,"Yes, madam."
466,You're the freshest Fifi I ever met.
467,I am nice Fifi.
468,How nice?
469,Not too nice.
470,Your right eye says yes and your left eye says no.
471,"Fifi, you're cockeyed."
472,Quite right.
473,"For instance, at the moment, I'm looking at someone else, and what's more, let go of my hands."
474,"You're charming, fascinating, delightful."
475,Stop kicking me.
476,Stop pinching me. That's better.
477,"Now, you're behaving like a gentleman."
478,Give me back my shoe.
479,"Girls on my table don't look at other men, you understand?"
480,I'm not your slave.
481,"After all, we're living in 1885."
482,Shut up.
483,Constantinople.
484,Number seven.
485,Where?
486,"To the private dining room Oh, no. I never go to private dining rooms."
487,I don't want to act the lady but...
488,May I put it down?
489,Please.
490,"And now, Fifi, if you feel in the mood for banker, the door is not lock."
491,What's the matter?
492,Great man.
493,His only mistake was he attacked too early.
494,That's how I lost Waterloo.
495,"Oh, now, listen."
496,I want mine to be kissing.
497,"I want to enjoy sometime, but this is absolutely demoralizing you."
498,"First, it's the Turk, now it's Napoleon."
499,"Well, I'll give you Napoleon."
500,"You can have him all night, and see if you can see his head off the second button."
501,Anything wrong?
502,Now it's impossible.
503,I take her upstairs and just when I am about to be nice to her she stops to talk about another man.
504,Shame on you.
505,"Why, the girl has no etiquette. Come on."
506,Would you like to dance?
507,No.
508,Not a word. Have I hurt you?
509,Yet I know.
510,"You have not told me, but you hold me for I know."
