19,Four Mississippi.
20,Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL...

32,...and you'd be right.
33,"But what you probably don't know is, more often than not..."
34,"...the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle."
35,"Because as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage..."
36,...but the second is for the insurance.
37,And the left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming.
38,To protect his blind side.
39,"The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big."
40,He's wide in the butt and massive in the thighs.
41,"He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup."
42,This is a rare and expensive combination...

484,I love that man.
485,What's this?
486,The state makes schools measure for career aptitude in the eighth grade. . .
487,. . .and this just came with his file.
488,What's it say about Michael?
489,"Spatial relations, third percentile."
490,"Ability to learn, fifth percentile."
491,It's funny though. He tested in the 98th percentile in one category.
492,Which one?
493,Protective instincts.
494,"So over here you have a desk, chest of drawers..."
495,". ..you have a nightstand, a light, an alarm."
496,Sean says all pro athletes use futons if they can't find a bed big enough. . .
497,. ..so l got you one of those.
498,Of course the frame was heinous.
499,"I was not about to let that in my house, but I got you something nicer."
500,lt's mine?
501,"Yes, sir."
502,What?
503,Never had one before.
504,"What, a room to yourself?"
505,A bed.
506,"Well, you have one now."
507,MRS. BOSWELL: Okay. Define osmosis.
508,I think I know that one.
509,It's when water passes through a barrier.
510,"That's basically right, Michael."
511,Very good.
512,Name the combatants in the Battle of Waterloo.
513,I know that one. Um....
514,"The little guy, Napoleon."
515,Uhhuh.
516,He was on one side and a duke was on the other.
517,Duke of Wellington.
518,"Yeah, and the Duke of Wellington, he had Russians helping him."
519,Prussians.
520,Enough with the rugby shirts.
521,You look like a giant bumblebee.
522,SJ: That Taco Bell.
523,KFC cattycorner. And the Long John Silver's on the next block.
524,MlCHAEL: You own all of them?
525,Yeah. We've got like hundreds.
526,Eightyfive.
527,Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to go to work?
528,"Whoa, whoa! Hey! l'm working even when l'm not working."
529,What?
530,And you eat at all these places for free?
531,All you want. lt's awesome.
532,What do y'all do with all the leftover food from the restaurant?
533,"We have to throw some out, what's already cooked."
534,That's too bad.
535,"Yeah, I'd rather sell it."
536,Seems like you could give it away or something.
537,"You should check into that, Daddy."
538,"SEAN: All right, l will, SJ."
539,How come we're not eating at one of your restaurants tonight?
540,"Well, because tonight is a special occasion."
541,SJ: What?
542,I talked to Coach Cotton. He said Michael's grades have improved enough...
543,. ..that he can go out for spring football in March.
544,lsn't that great?
545,"Oh, man! You're gonna crush some people!"
546,"SEAN CHUCKLES Hey, guys, how we doing?"

553,"Come on, SJ!"
554,I need some new magazines.
555,"Michael, come on. Come on."

579,MlCHAEL: I don't know where he stays.
580,LElGH ANNE: When was the last time you saw him?
581,"When I was little, maybe."
582,"LElGH ANNE: ""Once upon a time in Spain, there was a little bull..."
583,. ..and his name was Ferdinand.
584,All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump...
585,. ..and butt their heads together.
586,But not Ferdinand.
587,He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers.
588,He had a favorite spot out in the pasture under a cork tree.
589,LElGH ANNE: lt was his favorite tree...
590,"...and he would sit in its shade all day and smell the flowers."" Good night."
591,Good night.

599,It has everything to do with Michael.
600,Mm. Mm.
601,Happy's good.
602,Mm.
603,You know what l think we should do?
604,We should start a charity for kids like Michael.
605,Okay.
606,Maybe fund a program at Wingate.
607,Sure.
608,Lord knows that school could use a little color.
609,Poor Michael's like a fly in the milk in that place.
610,Are you listening to me?
611,Hmm?
612,l try to concentrate on one. . .
613,. ..thing...
614,. ..at a time.

620,"Big smiles, everyone."
621,"And one, two, three!"
622,Michael.
623,Come on down here and get in the next one.
624,Come on. Come on. Come on down.
625,"Oh, come on. lt's not like I'm gonna put it on the Christmas card."
626,"Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter."
627,That's good.
628,Really big smiles.
629,"Okay, one, two, three."
630,"Say ""Rebels!"" ALL: Rebels!"
631,"ANNOUNCER ON TV: a blitz off the corner, quick pass over the middle."
632,The hot route was there. And that's....
633,LElGH ANNE: l got it.
634,Who's winning?
635,Tennessee.
636,Ugh. Who they playing?
637,Clemson.
638,Your mama roots against Tennessee no matter who they play?
639,"Uh Yes, l do. With gusto."

641,"Colliebell, l thought you were going over to your boyfriend's."
642,Thought l'd hang around here for the day.
643,Hmm.
644,I like that.
645,There's a couple messages on the machine.
646,I didn't check them.
647,LElGH ANNE: All right.
648,"BOBBY: Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne, it's your cousin Bobby. Happy New Year's."
649,"Listen, l've had about five cold ones.. ."
650,Of course you have.
651,...so I'm just gonna go ahead and ask: Did y'all know there's a colored boy in your Christmas card?
652,BOTH CHUCKLING What?
653,You just looked teenytiny next to him.
654,Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.
655,"WOMEN LAUGHING Hey, does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell?"
656,"Because if he does, Sean's gonna lose a few stores."
657,He's a good kid.
658,"Well, l say you make it official and just adopt him."
659,WOMEN LAUGHING He's gonna be 1 8 in a few months. Doesn't really make much sense to legally adopt.
660,Leigh Anne.
661,Is this some sort of whiteguilt thing?
662,ELAINE: What will your daddy say?
663,Um.... Before or after he turns over in his grave?
664,"Daddy's been gone five years, Elaine."
665,"Make matters worse, you were at the funeral. Remember?"
666,You wore Chanel and that awful black hat.
667,"Look, here's the deal."
668,"I don't need y'all to approve my choices, all right?"
669,But l do ask that you respect them. You have no idea what this boy's been through.
670,And if this is gonna become some running diatribe...
671,. .. l can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home.
672,"Leigh Anne, l'm sorry. We didn't intend to No, we didn't, really."
673,BETH: I think what you're doing is so great.
674,To open up your home to him?
675,"Honey, you're changing that boy's life."
676,No.
677,He's changing mine.
678,"And that's awesome for you, but what about Collins?"
679,What about Collins?
680,ELAINE: Aren't you worried?
681,"I mean, even just a little?"
682,"He's a boy, a large, black boy, sleeping under the same roof."
683,Shame on you.
684,I've got this.
685,"LElGH ANNE: Be honest with me, okay?"
686,Does Michael being here make you uncomfortable?
687,They're stupid kids.
688,Who cares what they say?
689,What kids?
690,At school.
691,They're juvenile.
692,And what do the juvenile kids say?
693,It's really not worth repeating.
694,And don't worry about SJ.
695,He likes all the attention. He introduces Michael as his big brother.
696,And what about you?
697,It's fine.
698,"I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street."
699,I could make other arrangements.
700,"GIRL: Hi, Mike."
701,Hi. Need a push?
702,Yes.
703,MlCHAEL: Oh.
704,"GIRL: Higher, Mike, higher!"

709,Collins?
710,Quit looking at me like that.
711,"I mean, we study together at home."
712,You know how much those things weigh?
713,This kid's gonna make us all famous.
714,"CHUCKLES Easy, Bert, man. It's only the spring."
715,He hasn't even had his first practice yet.
716,"No, he's a player."
717,PLAYERS: Break!

719,PLAYERS: Break!
720,"COTTON: Get down, son."

726,QB: Huddle up.

734,"QB: Set, go!"
735,Balloons! They're balloons!
736,"Guys, quit looking at the balloons."
737,Everybody!
738,COTTON: Most kids from bad situations can't wait to be violent...
739,. ..and that comes out on the field.
740,"But this kid, he acts like he doesn't wanna hit anyone."
741,He's Ferdinand the Bull.
742,COTTON: What?
743,Nothing.
744,I thought he was gonna be a player. l can't believe I used up all my chips to get him in.
745,I thought you said it was your Christian duty.
746,"Look, Bert, he's never even played before."
747,"Yeah, and he won't this fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then."
748,Who died and made him Bear Bryant?
749,LAUGHS Unbelievable.
750,"Oh, God bless me."
751,This is your summer workout sheet.
752,"Now, first it says to warm up and get loose."
753,"Well, go ahead, get loose."
754,Are you loose?
755,"Okay. Next, it's five 1 00yard runs to stretch out your legs."
756,Can we just go home and play video games?
757,Look!
758,Everybody at Wingate is expecting you to be a star football player.
759,"Don't wanna let them down, do you?"
760,l don't know.
761,What about Dad and Mom?
762,"Because, you see, in our family, everyone's an athlete."
763,Dad was a basketball star.
764,Collins plays volleyball and runs track.
765,"And me, well, as you know, I do it all."
766,"And Mom Well, Mom was a cheerleader..."
767,". ..which doesn't exactly count, but don't tell her I said that. Okay?"
768,Okay.
769,Okay.
770,BLOWS WHlSTLE Yeah. Fifty.
771,MlCHAEL: Uhn.
772,SJ: Fiftyone.
773,Fiftytwo. Fiftythree.
774,"Come on, you can get him."
775,"Go, go, go! Come on!"
776,Five seconds left in the game!
777,This way!
778,"High knees, high knees, high knees!"
779,"Speed kills, baby! Run like the wind!"
780,"CHUCKLES Go, Michael, go!"

788,"SJ: You gotta get the tackle, come on, come on, come on!"
789,"Come on, Michael."
790,GRUNTlNG Mrs. Tuohy?
791,"I hear ""Mrs. Tuohy,"" l look over my shoulder for my motherinlaw."
792,Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else.
793,Can you help me get something?
794,What?
795,Driver's license.
796,Why do you need a driver's license when you don't even have a car?
797,"Michael, why do you want a driver's license?"
798,It's something to carry with my name on it.
799,COMPUTER BEEPS There's no one by the name of Michael Oher in the system.
800,"Another last name, perhaps?"
801,"Look, l will sign something that says he lives with us."
802,We'll pay for all of the insurance.
803,Whatever it takes. Okay?
804,What's it gonna take?
805,SEAN: You wanna do what?
806,You heard me.
807,Shouldn't we at least talk about this?
808,What do you think we're doing?
809,And don't act like I'm going behind your back.
810,I know you put us down as Michael's medical contact at school.
811,There is a huge difference between paying for a broken arm. . .
812,". ..and being legally responsible for someone. l mean, a kid we barely know."
813,That's another thing. We need to find out more about his past.
814,He won't talk about it. He's like an onion.
815,You have to peel him back a layer at a time.
816,Not if you use a knife.
817,What if we took him to a child psychologist or something?
818,Do you really expect Big Mike to?
819,Michael.
820,Do you expect Michael to lie on a couch...
821,. ..and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen?
822,"I mean, Michael's gift is his ability to forget."
823,He's mad at no one and he really doesn't care what happened in the past.
824,You're right.
825,"Excuse me? ""You're right""?"
826,How'd those words taste coming out of your mouth?
827,Like vinegar.
828,"Well, at least promise me you'll think about it."
829,All right.
830,"""All right, you'll think about it,"" or, ""All right, we should do it""?"
831,Is there a difference?
832,Just tell Gerald to hold on to the chiffonier and l will be by there after a while.
833,You know I gotta call you back. Bye.
834,Excuse me.
835,"I'm not cutting, l'm just asking."
836,Let me tell you something. We have been sitting around here for over an hour. . .
837,. ..and when l look around and all I see are people shooting the bull and drinking coffee.
838,Who runs this place?
839,"I'd have it in shape in two days, I can tell you that."
840,l bet you would. How can l help you?
841,"Oh, he was first."
842,"No, you go ahead. l think l wanna hear this."
843,Me too.
844,I do not appreciate the attitude.
845,"Ma'am, now, you can tell me what you want. . ."
846,. ..or l can make sure you wait here all day.
847,"Now, how can l help you?"
848,I would like to become a legal guardian.
849,Lord help that child.
850,There's very little on Michael.
851,Most of his files have been lost.
852,"Well, what is in there?"
853,A few case notes.
854,This one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed Michael...
855,. ..from Denise Oher's care when Michael was 7.
856,Quite a scene evidently.
857,They had to split up the kids.
858,And it's far from the worst.
859,Where is she? His mother?
860,"I don't know. lf you find her, we got a heap more files we could add to."
861,"Well, how many kids does she have?"
862,"Least a dozen, probably. lf not more."
863,"With her drugarrest record, my guess would be, she can't even remember."
864,Can l see that?
865,"So we would need her permission, right?"
866,No. Michael is a ward of the state.
867,Just apply and get a judge to sign off on it.
868,So you would just give him away without even telling his mother?
869,MAN 1 : Check out this piece right here.
870,MAN 2: Yeah.
871,"MAN 1 : Damn, girl."
872,LElGH ANNE: Miss Oher?
873,Hi. Miss Miss Oher?
874,You from the state?
875,No.
876,"My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy, and your son..."
877,". ..Michael, lives with me..."
878,. ..and my family.
879,How is my boy? How's Big Mike?
880,He's fine. He's doing real well.
881,"We might have some wine in the kitchen, if you...."
882,"Oh, no, no. That's real kind."
883,When did you last see Michael?
884,I don't know.
885,How many? How many foster kids you got living with you?
886,"Oh, l'm not a foster parent to Michael."
887,We're just helping him out.
888,State don't pay you nothing?
889,"No, no."
890,And you feed him and you buy him clothes too?
891,"Well, when we can find them in his size."
892,You are a fine Christian lady.
893,"Well, l try to be."
894,"This all real nice, what you're doing. . ."
895,. ..but don't be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone.
896,What do you mean?
897,He's a runner. That's what the state called him after they took him from me.
898,Every foster home they sent him to...
899,. ..he'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me.
900,"No matter where l was, that boy would come find me, take care of me."
901,I've had some health problems.
902,"Miss Oher, was Michael born under a different name?"
903,Proctor. That was his daddy's last name.
904,Where is he?
905,l ain't seen him since he left.
906,And when was that?
907,Week after Mike was born.
908,Do you happen to have his birth certificate?
909,It's all right. l'll figure it out.
910,"CLEARS THROAT Mrs. Oher, you'll always be Michael's mama."
911,Would you like to see him?
912,VOICE BREAKlNG No. Not this way.
913,It's Williams.
914,His last name's Williams.
915,Couldn't even remember who the boy's father is.
916,"I checked out the new Madden. The colors are better, graphics brighter. lt's awesome."
917,"Michael, we have something we'd like to ask you."
918,What?
919,"Well, Leigh Anne and l, we Well, we'd like to become your legal guardians."
920,What's that mean?
921,"What it means is, is that we wanna know. . ."
922,. ..if you would like to become part of this family.
923,Kind of thought I already was.
924,"LAUGHS FAMlLY LAUGHING Well, all right, then."
925,Right here.
926,LElGH ANNE: You got a couple steps.
927,SEAN: Better watch that big foot.
928,LElGH ANNE: One more.
929,One more. There you go.
930,All right. Take off the blindfold.
931,"SEAN: Well? That's the one you wanted, isn't it? Heh."
932,"Here. Here you go, go ahead."
933,Take it for a ride. Go on.
934,SJ: Can l go too?
935,"Yeah, but, Michael? Be careful."
936,Shotgun!
937,Whoohoo!
938,He wanted a truck?
939,"Well, Michael thinks he's a redneck."
940,"SJ: Come on, Michael!"
941,"Okay. See, you're the ketchup, here at left tackle on the weak side."
942,The first play is simple. Gap.
943,"Now, see, this just means that you're going to block whoever's in front of you. . ."
944,". ..or on your inside shoulder, if you're not covered by a defender."
945,"Now, l'll be the running back, and you show me what you're supposed to do."
946,Ready? Hike!
947,You'll block him. He'll hit him.
948,Quarterback'll hand it off.
949,"He gets the ball, and he takes off!"
950,Open lane to the end zone.
951,All there is to it.
952,What's going on here?
953,Blended spice just scored.
954,We were going through the playbook.
955,Michael got moved to offense.
956,"When you're done, put the players back in the spice cabinet. Thank you."
957,SJ: No problem.
958,"Actually, Mom, we were kind of waiting for you."
959,"You see, the new Madden game came out. . ."
960,. ..and me and Michael were wanting to go get it.
961,"l can't, l've got a meeting in 1 0 minutes."
962,But he can drive.
963,He can drive us.
964,"YOUNG MC'S ""BUST A MOVE"" PLAYlNG OVER CAR STEREO SJ: Oh, yeah, that's what l'm talking about."
965,MlCHAEL: What you know about this?
966,SJ: l know a lot about this.
967,Show me something then.
968,l'll show you something.
969,l'll start it. Follow my lead.
970,All right.

1466,"What do you got for me, Phil?"
1467,l've been thinking a lot about that...
1468,. ..and one of the things I think would be special.. .
1469,. ..is we'll walk arminarm to the center of Neyland Stadium in the first ball game. . .
1470,. ..and do the coin toss together.
1471,How's that sound?
1472,"Coach Fulmer, it's a pleasure doing business with you."
1473,"My pleasure, CJ. You bet you, buddy."
1474,CROWD CHEERING DOORBELL RlNGS Congratulations on getting hired.

1480,LSU is out.
1481,Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL.
1482,"Don't wanna name names, but on Michael's first two trips. .."
1483,. . .somebody took him to a titty bar.
1484,Terrible.
1485,Tell me about it.
1486,He had nightmares for weeks.
1487,"So when he visits, I want you to feed him ltalian."
1488,He likes fettuccine Alfredo.
1489,And take him to a movie.
1490,Not Chainsaw Massacre because he'll just cover his eyes.
1491,Then get him in bed by 1 0. Got it?
1492,"Yes, ma'am."
1493,All right.
1494,What about Tennessee?
1495,Mm.
1496,"Breaks my heart, but they're still in the hunt."

1499,Hmm.
1500,He's his daddy's boy. You ready?
1501,Let's do it.
1502,All right.
1503,"ED: Mike, do you love barbecue?"
1504,"I tell you what, Mike."
1505,You can go to a gas station and get the best barbecue you ever got.
1506,It's a wonderful place to live.
1507,"Fried catfish, all the good food that we love to eat and that's not good for us. . ."
1508,". ..you can have it there, Mike, I promise you."
1509,"And for you, SJ, this is what I can do."
1510,"At Ole Miss, we have The Grove by the stadium."
1511,We walk it before every game in front of thousands of people.
1512,It's a sacred ritual. And l'm in front.
1513,Seen it a thousand times.
1514,Ever seen it from the front of the line?
1515,"Next year, you and me, leading the team."
1516,Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin.
1517,I'll throw in a sideline pass.
1518,"Have you decided yet, Michael?"
1519,"No, Miss Sue."
1520,But you like Tennessee?
1521,Yeah. That's a good school.
1522,Not at the academic level of Ole Miss. . .
1523,. ..but they have a outstanding Science Department.
1524,You know what they're famous for?
1525,They work with the FBI . ..
1526,. ..to study the effects of soil on decomposing body parts.
1527,What's that mean?
1528,"Well, when they find a body, the police wanna know how long it's been dead."
1529,So the fine folks at Tennessee help them out.
1530,"Oh, they have lots of body parts."
1531,Arms and legs and hands.. .
1532,. ..from hospitals and medical schools.
1533,CHUCKLES And do you know where they store them?
1534,Right underneath the football field.
1535,"So while it's fine and dandy to have 1 00,000 fans cheering for you..."
1536,. ..the bodies you should be worried about are the ones right under the turf.
1537,Set to poke up through the ground and grab you.
1538,"Well, it's your decision where you wanna play ball."
1539,Don't let me influence you.
1540,APPLAUSE All the other teachers are on board.
1541,I don't know what your problem is.
1542,I'm sorry. I will not give a student a grade he or she doesn't deserve.
1543,"Well, Michael needs a B."
1544,What does he have to do to deserve that?
1545,"Right now Michael's doing Cminus, Dplus work."
1546,His best chance at improvement is the written essay at the end of the year.
1547,It counts for a third of the grade.
1548,"Well, that's it. We're sunk."
1549,GAME PLAYING ON TV Why don't you write about Great Expectations?
1550,You're a lot like Pip.
1551,"I mean, he was poor. He was an orphan and someone kind of found him."
1552,You should be able to relate to that.
1553,Fine. We'll go through the reading list.
1554,"But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael."
1555,Pygmalion.
1556,A Tale of Two Cities.
1557,"""The Charge of the Light Brigade."" Half a league, half a league Half a league onward I love that one."
1558,He loves it.
1559,Why don't you do this?
1560,And l'll watch basketball.
1561,SEAN: Okay.
1562,All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.
1563,They named LSU's stadium Death Valley because of this story.
1564,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson was writing about LSUOle Miss."
1565,You're kidding.
1566,No.
1567,lt's a great story.
1568,lt's a poem!
1569,"""Forward, the Light Brigade!"" That's like the offense."
1570,"""Charge for the guns,"" he said: It's the end zone."
1571,Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.
1572,"""Forward, the Light Brigade!"" Was there a man dismay'd?"
1573,Not tho' the soldier knew Someone had blunder'd: Someone made a mistake?
1574,Yeah. Their leader.
1575,Their coach.
1576,But why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up?
1577,Theirs not to make reply Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do and die: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.
1578,"They're all gonna die, aren't they?"
1579,Yeah.
1580,"That's really, really sad."
1581,"I think you just found something to write about, Michael."
1582,MlCHAEL: Courage is a hard thing to figure.
1583,You can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake...
1584,...but you're not supposed to question adults...
1585,...or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules.
1586,"Maybe they know best, but maybe they don't."
1587,"It all depends on who you are, where you come from."
1588,Didn't at least one of the 600 guys think about giving up...
1589,...and joining with the other side?
1590,"I mean, valley of Death, that's pretty salty stuff."
1591,That's why courage is tricky.
1592,Should you always do what others tell you to do?
1593,Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something.
1594,"I mean, any fool can have courage."
1595,"But honor, that's the real reason you either do something or you don't."
1596,It's who you are and maybe who you want to be.
1597,If you die trying for something important...
1598,"...then you have both honor and courage, and that's pretty good."
1599,I think that's what the writer was saying.
1600,That you should hope for courage and try for honor.
1601,And maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some too.
1602,Kevin Lin.
1603,APPLAUSE Good job.
1604,Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
1605,Matthew Nichols.

1620,"CHUCKLES Way to go, bro."

1631,Whew.
1632,Hello.
1633,This is Mrs. Tuohy.
1634,"They just wanna ask you a couple questions, Michael. You have nothing to hide."
1635,Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?
1636,My name is Jocelyn Granger.
1637,I'm the Assistant Director of Enforcement for the NCAA.
1638,"Please, call me Leigh Anne."
1639,"So let's do this, shall we?"
1640,"If you wouldn't mind, I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone."
1641,LElGH ANNE: And how long is that gonna take?
1642,A while.
1643,It's all right. lt's okay.
1644,Go on.

1647,"LElGH ANNE: l don't know, Sean."
1648,Just have a bad feeling about this one.
1649,"This woman is tough, tough, tough, tough, tough. Hold on."
1650,Hey.
1651,The client wants what?
1652,Were you aware that Coach Cotton was accepting a job at Ole Miss?
1653,No.
1654,And that this job offer came after you signed with them?
1655,"Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian, went to Ole Miss."
1656,He played basketball.
1657,And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.
1658,She was a cheerleader.
1659,Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is their favorite school?
1660,Do they like any other universities?
1661,"What about, say, Tennessee?"
1662,"No, they can't stand Tennessee."
1663,And your tutor.
1664,Miss Sue?
1665,Miss Sue.
1666,Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad too.
1667,Miss Sue ever try to persuade you to attend Ole Miss?
1668,Did you know that the Tuohys make generous donations to Ole Miss?
1669,That even Miss Sue makes donations?
1670,"That the Tuohys, they have a condo in Oxford.. ."
1671,. ..so they can attend as many athletic events as possible.
1672,"That in fact, both Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are by our definition boosters."
1673,Mr. Oher.
1674,Do you understand?
1675,Do you know why l'm here?
1676,To investigate?
1677,Yes. To investigate.
1678,I'm here to investigate your odd. . .predicament.
1679,"Do you find it odd, your predicament?"
1680,Michael.
1681,I don't know.
1682,Can l? Can l leave now?
1683,"No, you can't."
1684,"What do you want, ma'am?"
1685,l want the facts. I need the truth.
1686,l didn't lie.
1687,l wanna know what you think about this.
1688,Think about what?!
1689,The NCAA fears that with your recruitment. . .
1690,. ..a door might be opened.. .
1691,. ..that boosters from schools in the South...
1692,. ..will become legal guardians of young athletes without means. . .
1693,. ..and funnel them to their alma maters.
1694,I'm not saying l believe it.
1695,I'm not saying l don't.
1696,But there are many people involved in this case who would argue that the Tuohys. . .
1697,". . .they took you in, they clothed you. .."
1698,No.
1699,". ..they fed you, they paid for your private education."
1700,"They bought you a car, paid for a tutor. . ."
1701,No. No.
1702,. ..all as part of a plan to ensure that you play football for the University of Mississippi.
1703,Michael? We're not finished.
1704,"The toile's not available, like l told you months ago."
1705,So why don't we go with the ticking?
1706,The low nap. It's a beautiful I'll call you back. Bye.
1707,"Michael. So, what happened?"
1708,Why'd you do it?
1709,What?
1710,All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
1711,"Well, of course I did. We love Ole Miss."
1712,Why'd you do this for me?
1713,What?
1714,Everything. Was it for you or was it for me?
1715,Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?
1716,Was it so I would do what you wanted?
1717,"Michael, no, l That's what she thinks."
1718,Is she right?
1719,"Michael, honey, l need for you to just listen to me."
1720,Don't you dare lie to me.
1721,I'm not stupid.
1722,"Michael? Michael, of course you're not stupid, Michael. Mi I should've followed him."
1723,You had no way of knowing he'd disappear.
1724,Was he right?
1725,What he said about us?
1726,"Leigh Anne, be reasonable."
1727,We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts and we gave him a bed.
1728,To hell with the NCAA.
1729,I would do it again tomorrow.
1730,What about all the rest of it?
1731,All the stuff we did to make sure that he got a scholarship.
1732,A scholarship to Ole Miss.
1733,He could go anywhere he wanted.
1734,He knew that.
1735,"Oh, did he? Did you ask him?"
1736,Because I sure as hell know l never did.
1737,Hey. Come here.
1738,Yeah.
1739,SIGHS Am l a good person?

1741,Not rhetorical.
1742,You are the best person that l know.
1743,"Everything you do, you do for others."
1744,And why is that?
1745,I have not a clue.
1746,But you obviously get some sort of sick satisfaction out of it.
1747,Sean.
1748,Yeah?
1749,What if he never comes back?
