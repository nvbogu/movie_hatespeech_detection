124,124,We'll rent a small furnished room.
125,125,I'll pay for the food.
126,126,"You supply the quarters for the Laundromat and we'll split the grass, the gas and the light bill."
127,127,Sounds romantic.
128,128,Do we have a deal?

130,130, No?
131,131,But I'd like you to get to know me better.
132,132,I'm trying.
133,133,I know what you're trying.
134,134,It's not getting to know me.
135,135,I always thought sex was a nice way to begin a relationship.
136,136,Okay...
137,137,You go to school here?
138,138,"No, I work down the block."
139,139,I raise funds for a community service project.
140,140,I like that.
141,141,What's it called?
142,142,Community Rescue.
143,143,Here.
144,144,"Anytime you want to, call me and come by."
145,145,My name's Rebecca.
146,146,Call me.
147,147,"Can't handle it, he shouldn't drink."
148,148,There's a discussion after the film.
149,149,Man on film: There he goes.
150,150,Man on walkietalkie: Can you boys hear me?
151,151,"Yeah, yeah, we got you."
152,152,He's got him a biggie.
153,153,Maybe we oughta ask for a raise.
154,154,Little levity.
155,155,"It's no use, Jekyll."
156,156,I've done nothing.
157,157,I'm Dr. Jekyll.
158,158,"I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, I tell you."
159,159,I've done nothing.
160,160,You're looking for a man named Hyde.
161,161,Hyde.
162,162,"I am Dr. Jekyll, Henry Jekyll."
163,163,I'm Dr. Jekyll I tell you!
164,164,"I tell you, I'm Dr. Jekyll."
165,165,Dr. Henry Jekyll.
166,166,"Oh, you should hear my ""Gone with the Wind."" I think that's such a fantastic picture."
167,167,I always love seeing it.
168,168,There's plenty of refreshments for everyone right this way.
169,169,This horseshit goes on for about ten minutes.
170,170,"Then a little sugar bombing, you know, a little brownies, KoolAid."
171,171,You know what I think is really interesting about the film?
172,172,It's the way that it deals with the duality of human nature.
173,173,"Hmm, well, Robert Louis Stevenson's just always been a little I don't know, little deep for me."
174,174,"Although I think I understood ""Treasure Island"" when I read that in the third grade."
175,175,"See, what I liked about the movie is the way that it deals with the duality of our nature..."
176,176,And the tragedy of giving in to our evil side.
177,177, Exactly!
178,178, What's the big deal?
179,179,"I mean, it's just horror flick."
180,180,"Not just, also."
181,181, I think I agree with  Danny? Danny?
182,182,How'd you like the movie?
183,183,"Well, I think obviously it's about the duality of our nature."
184,184,That's great.
185,185,That's as clear as you're going to get.
186,186,I agree.
187,187,Now when you see your son what are you going to do?
188,188,Leave it to me.
189,189,I really want to see you again.
190,190,When can I see you?
191,191,Any time you want.
192,192,"Okay, boys, they're coming down the steps."
193,193,Hit it.
194,194,All you have to do is be there at 6:00.
195,195,And I'll pick you up. We're going to have a wonderful time.
196,196,"You just bring your sleeping bag, your toothbrush..."
197,197,What are you doing?
198,198,Get back!
199,199, Brian.
200,200, Asshole.
201,201, Please. Brian!
202,202," Grab him, grab him!"
203,203,Let me talk to you.
204,204,Inside. Come on.
205,205,"Oh, my God."
206,206,They're trying to kidnap Aaron.
207,207,"Man: Hey, Danny!"
208,208,Son of a bitch kicked me in the balls.
209,209,What the fuck did I tell you?
210,210,"Now, the next time we do it my way, okay, Senator?"
211,211,You jackoff.
212,212,"Oh, thank you!"
213,213, That was great.
214,214," You got it, right?"
215,215,"It's okay, it's okay."
216,216,"Oh, Danny, you were great."
217,217, Thanks.
218,218," Good thing I came over, huh?"
219,219,"Hey. Hey, Aaron."
220,220,You owe those guys money or what?
221,221,Aaron's father thinks he should be a big rich corporation lawyer and nothing else.
222,222,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
223,223,That was his father?
224,224,And his hired kidnappers.
225,225,I'm over 18.
226,226,Nobody can tell me how to live my life.
227,227,Or what to think.
228,228,Or who my friends should be.
229,229,It's all right.
230,230,You're safe now.
231,231,"Aaron, why'd your father call you Brian?"
232,232, Bananas are ready.
233,233,Danny: Yeah.
234,234,I asked Sean to tell you.
235,235,"No, I'm just not going to come home for the weekend."
236,236,"No, Dad, it wasn't anything you or Mom said."
237,237,I'm positive.
238,238,"Yeah, it's just it's a commune."
239,239,"No, I don't know if it's a religious thing or can you hold on for a second, Dad?"
240,240,"Terry, Terry..."
241,241,I can't hear you.
242,242,"Well, turn it off!"
243,243,"Hello, Dad."
244,244,What did you say your name...
245,245,"Well, yes, Dad, a bit of religion never did hurt anybody."
246,246,You're absolutely right.
247,247,"Well, look, I'd love to chat, Dad, but my hands are falling apart, okay?"
248,248,I'm outta here.
249,249,Bye.
250,250,Woman: I hate that. Hate it.
251,251,"Jane, when we get to Homeland there's something that'll get you higher than you've ever been before."
252,252,"If you say fresh air, I'll kill you."
253,253,Whoa!
254,254,"Hey, we're almost there, everybody."
255,255, Come on in!
256,256, Pull right up!

259,259,Excuse me.
260,260,"Do you have any this is it, huh?"
261,261,Do you have any protein or anything?
262,262,"You know, steak, fish."
263,263, Maybe some escargot.
264,264,"No, you see, I need my protein for training."
265,265,"Okay, forget it."
266,266,"How about we send out to McDonald's, huh?"
267,267,My treat.
268,268,"We don't eat meat here, Danny."
269,269,But this food is organically grown right here on our own earth.
270,270,It's totally nourishing.
271,271,Good.
272,272,Oh.
273,273,Could you pass the acidophilus culture then?
274,274, Hi.
275,275, Everyone: Hi.
276,276,"Ever since we started Homeland, I've heard, ""Thank you, Neil, for giving me a place to live."" ""Thank you, Neil, for understanding it's hard to be young in this country."" And as I was walking through our fields on my way over here to eat our food I said, ""What is wrong with me?"" It is I who should give thanks..."
277,277,to you...
278,278,for making this a home.
279,279,My home.
280,280,Our home.
281,281,"So from now on, I thank you."
282,282, Zeke here's the best potter we got.
283,283, How you doin'?
284,284, Even if he's a little messy.
285,285," Oh, sorry."
286,286, I always wanted to learn pottery.
287,287, Yeah?
288,288,This is where we make all the cups and pots and plates.
289,289,May I take a photo?
290,290,Sure.
291,291,You spend all day here if you want.
292,292,This is where the weaving and the sewing's done.
293,293,This is the design center.
294,294,They're designing new housing.
295,295,And this is the wood shop.
296,296,They're making new benches for the community hall.
297,297, Hi.
298,298," Hi, how are you?"
299,299, Hi.
300,300, Hi.
301,301,This is the print shop.
302,302,Hello.
303,303,"Listen, don't look around."
304,304,Just act normal.
305,305,Keep smiling.
306,306,Pretend everything's okay.
307,307,"This is a religious cult, isn't it?"
308,308,If you wanna think I'm sort of crazy that lives with a horrible tribe it's up to you.
309,309,"Well, you're not answering my question."
310,310,People love to put labels on things.
311,311,You can call it a cult so you don't have to understand what's going on here.
312,312,"St. Augustine said, ""I believe in order that I might understand."" Oh, this is definitely a religious cult."
313,313,Excuse me.
314,314,It's a community of people trying to create a better world.
315,315,You knew from the beginning I had a special kind of life.
316,316,Yeah.
317,317,It's a good life.
318,318,I just wanted you to see it.
319,319,"Anyway, it's only a threeday weekend."
320,320,You're free to come and go.
321,321,Yeah.
322,322,Say brownie.
323,323,Brownie.
324,324, You didn't say brownie.
325,325,I know.
326,326,It's crazy.
327,327,It is so beautiful here.
328,328,"You know, I think I could be happy here as long as as long as I knew you were around."
329,329,Rebecca.
330,330,"Hi, Neil!"
331,331,"Oh, hi."
332,332,I'm Neil Kirklander.
333,333,Hi.
334,334,I'm Danny.
335,335,Danny Stetson.
336,336,"Oh, yes."
337,337,"Rebecca's friend from the other evening, the one who helped save Aaron."
338,338,Well...
339,339,From the way everyone talked about you I expected to see someone built like The Incredible Hulk.
340,340,Ah.
341,341,Sorry to disappoint you.
342,342,Who are you?
343,343,I'm Danny Stetson.
344,344,Rebecca's friend.
345,345,I know your name.
346,346,That's the easy part.
347,347,I want you to tell me the hard part.
348,348,Who are you?
349,349,I don't know what you mean.
350,350,"I don't know, Neil."
351,351,Why don't you tell me?
352,352,You're in charge here.
353,353,Are you aiming for the Olympics?
354,354,"See, that's what we're doing here."
355,355,"We're becoming Olympic champions with our lives so that every time out, we're a ten."
356,356,Enjoy yourself.
357,357,Isn't Neil great?
358,358,"âª Rise, shine âª Give God the glory, glory âª âª Rise, shine âª Give God the glory, glory âª âª Rise and shine and give God the glory, glory..."
359,359,"Come on, Danny, time to wake up."
360,360,Time to wake up.
361,361,"âª Rise, shine, give God the glory, glory âª âª Rise, shine, give God the glory, glory âª âª Rise and shine and give God the glory, glory âª âª We're children of the Lord... âª Come on, up we go, Danny."

364,364,"I mean, can I get some coffee, at least?"
365,365,"Oh, you don't want caffeine, Dan."
366,366,It's poison.
367,367,"Sanka commercials, huh?"
368,368,"Look, I'm just just hungry."
369,369,"Here, Dan, why don't you have a brownie?"
370,370,Thanks.
371,371,"Feed your spirit, Dan, not your belly."
372,372,What can fill you?
373,373,Just food?
374,374,It will happen that fast.
375,375,I want each of you to look at that mess.
376,376,"It will be like that for the world when it goes down, moaning and shrieking and tearing out its hair."
377,377,And there will an ugly and eternal silence that the death and life pleasureseekers will be forced to endure with nothing to comfort their tortured souls but memories.
378,378,Of Cuisinarts and Perrier and their designer jeans.
379,379,We must rescue them.
380,380,We must rescue them from death and life.
381,381,We must rescue them.
382,382,We must rescue them from death and life.
383,383,We must rescue them.
384,384,We must rescue them from death and life.
385,385,We must rescue them.
386,386,We must rescue them from death and life.
387,387,Now we go to group.
388,388,I love group.
389,389,All right.
390,390,It's the best part of my day.
391,391,"Hey, where you going?"
392,392,I'm just going to go to the bathroom.
393,393,In group we talk about the things that Neil teaches us.
394,394,Yeah.
395,395,"I mean, you get to work on yourself."
396,396,How can I rescue someone from death and life if you don't work on yourself?
397,397,Yeah.
398,398,"Uh, I'm glad I came in here just to pee."
399,399, Huh?
400,400, Nothing.
401,401,"Okay, let's forget it."
402,402,False alarm.
403,403,Let's go.
404,404,If I raise my hand in group...
405,405,it's not to make a speech.
406,406,I guess I felt maybe I didn't deserve to be loved.
407,407,"But then after Neil, after what the said today, it proved to me that that maybe I wasn't so terrible."
408,408,"That my my father was the one with the problem and not me, right?"
409,409,Jane?
410,410,Um...
411,411,okay.
412,412,I feel like like I'm really safe here.
413,413,I I don't know.
414,414,I feel like I can't get into trouble.
415,415,"You know, trouble?"
416,416,Because I feel like Neil is is is there to help me and...
417,417,I know if I get an urge to do something wrong...
418,418,he won't let me.
419,419,"And if he's not around you guys won't let me, will you?"
420,420,Of course not.
421,421,"That's right, Jane."
422,422,That's great.
423,423,Danny?
424,424,I think that this is a very beautiful spot.
425,425,And you're all very nice people.
426,426,"You know, I agree with what Neil had to say, but, frankly, it was no big revelation."
427,427,"I mean, I think you've got to be awfully dumb not to realize that there is not much humanity or justice out there."
428,428,I haven't heard any answers.
429,429,I just thought we'd be talking more about social problems.
430,430,I like I like what Neil had to say about working harder on ourselves.
431,431,I I really did.
432,432,But I have questions Yes! Yes!
433,433,"Danny, Danny has put his finger on something that's essential in Neil's thought, that working on our inner selves, our hearts and minds, is the true beginning of change, right, Danny?"
434,434,Yes.
435,435,Absolutely.
436,436,I have a headache.
437,437,Huh?
438,438,"Don't do that to yourself, Danny."
439,439,You're turning yourself into a prostitute.
440,440,"If you love yourself, you take away from the real love you can give others."
441,441,"For God's sake, Gabriel, I'm not doing anything."
442,442,It's okay. It's okay.
443,443,Just go to sleep.
444,444,Peaceful dreams.
445,445,Hey.
446,446,"Hey, where's the chant?"
447,447,Make it perfect!
448,448,Make it perfect.
449,449,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
450,450,Make it perfect.
451,451,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
452,452,Make it perfect.
453,453,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
454,454,Make it perfect.
455,455,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
456,456,"Come on, Danny."
457,457,Make it perfect.
458,458,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
459,459,"Oh, Walter, are you okay?"
460,460,Leave him alone.
461,461,Walter...
462,462,can get up by himself.
463,463,Walter can become stronger.
464,464,That's it.
465,465,See?
466,466,God is in Walter's arms and legs.
467,467,God is making him into a new person.
468,468,Make it perfect.
469,469,Make it perfect.
470,470,Make it perfect.
471,471,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
472,472,Make it perfect.
473,473,"Make it perfect, make it perfect."
474,474,"Make it perfect, make it perfect, make it Come on, son, just relax."
475,475,"Slow, deep breaths."
476,476,"Son, deep breaths."
477,477,"Slow, deep breaths."
478,478,You'll be all right in a few minutes.
479,479,Gabriel... sometimes you know nothing.
480,480,Sometimes you can be so cruel and evil.
481,481,This is our home.
482,482,"This is not some place where we exploit the sacred human resource, not some Godless communist state, not some mindless multinational conglomerate."
483,483,This is our home.
484,484,"You're going to be all right, son."
485,485,Just relax.
486,486,Gabriel is perhaps one of the holiest amongst you.
487,487,But sometimes even he is caught in the grip of death and life.
488,488,"You're scared, aren't you?"
489,489,You're scared of slipping back.
490,490,"Well, yes, Neil."
491,491,"Please, save me."
492,492,"Dear God, I love this boy."
493,493,I would die for him.
494,494,I want you to rescue him from his worldly mind.
495,495,Rescue him and sweep him into your everloving arms.
496,496,Rescue him. Rescue him.
497,497,Rescue him.
498,498,Rescue him. Rescue him.
499,499,Rescue him.
500,500,Rescue me. Rescue me.
501,501,Rescue him. Rescue him.
502,502,Rescue him.
503,503,Rescue him.
504,504,Rescue him. Rescue him.
505,505,Rescue him.
506,506,Rescue him.

510,510," Man: What, what, what?"
511,511, Kevin: What about your major?
512,512,"Rebecca: It's only a threeday weekend, Danny."
513,513,You're free to come and go.
514,514, Neil: It will happen that fast.
515,515," Rebecca: I love you, Danny."
516,516,"Gabriel: Don't do that to yourself, Danny."
517,517,You're turning yourself into a prostitute.
518,518,"Perfect, perfect, perfect."
519,519,"You're perfect, perfect!"
520,520,Jacob! Aaron!
521,521,Get up. Get dressed.
522,522,It's Danny!
523,523,Danny!
524,524," Where are you, Danny?"
525,525, Ah!
526,526,"Hurry up, hurry up."
527,527,Let's go.
528,528,Danny!
529,529,"Come back, Danny!"
530,530,Whoa!
531,531,"Gabriel: Where are you, Danny?"
532,532,"Guys, wait a minute."
533,533,Where is he?
534,534, I don't see him!
535,535, There he is.
536,536," Oh, my God."
537,537, Danny!
538,538,Gabriel: We've gotta get down there.
539,539,We gotta jump!
540,540,We can't jump.
541,541,"Okay, okay, I'll get some rope."
542,542,No there's there's no time.
543,543,Man: Aaron!
544,544,"Aaron, are you all right?"
545,545,Yeah.
546,546,"Hang on, Aaron."
547,547,We're going for help.
548,548,"This is not a prison, Danny."
549,549,This is a community of love.
550,550,We only want those who want to be here and want to be part of our glorious adventure.
551,551,Here.
552,552,Call your parents and have them come get you.
553,553,"It's all right, son."
554,554,"I hate to see you go back to death and life, Danny."
555,555,"I don't want them to kill you, Danny."
556,556,I'd rather they kill me first.
557,557,Do you know what it is to love someone?
558,558,I was a liar before.
559,559,I called my doubts thoughts.
560,560,It was really hate.
561,561,"See, I know something now I didn't know before."
562,562,There was no love.
563,563,And I've seen love here.
564,564,I've seen love here.
565,565,I've seen love in Neil and I've seen it in all of you.
566,566,I was dead before I came to this place.
567,567,I was literally dead before I came here and I met all of you.
568,568,"Father, release my smothered spirit."
569,569,"Father, release my smothered spirit."
570,570,Open my blinded eyes.
571,571,Open my blinded eyes.
572,572,Let me be a vessel for your love.
573,573,Let me be a vessel for your love.
574,574,Let me be an instrument for your work.
575,575,Let me be an instrument for your work.
576,576,I renounce my former life.
577,577,I renounce my former life.
578,578,Danny is dead.
579,579,Danny is dead.
580,580,"I am Joshua, a warrior in your cause."
581,581,"I am Joshua, a warrior in your cause."
582,582,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
583,583,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
584,584,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
585,585,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
586,586,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
587,587,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
588,588,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
589,589,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
590,590,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
591,591,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
592,592,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
593,593,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
594,594,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
595,595,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
596,596,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
597,597,"Joshua's born, Danny is dead."
598,598,Hello.
599,599,Hello?
600,600,"Well, is this an obscene call?"
601,601," Danny: Mom, it's Danny."
602,602," Danny, where are you?"
603,603,I'm all right.
604,604,I'm somewhere where I'm finally happy.
605,605, I'm at Homeland.
606,606, You're where?
607,607,I'm with people who really love me and understand me and I've got a purpose to my life.
608,608,"Danny, what are you talking about?"
609,609,I'm not coming home.
610,610,Bye.
611,611, Da  Kevin?
612,612, What?
613,613,What if they won't let us see him?
614,614,Have you thought about that?
615,615,It's simple.
616,616,I'll kill them.
617,617,"Oh, wonderful."
618,618,"You know, if you're trying to get me crazier, you're succeeding admirably."
619,619,"Look, you're going to talk to Danny and I'm going to write a check for this yoyo for a new heater for his swimming pool and that will be that."
620,620,"Kevin and man on radio: âª Yes it's me and I'm in love again âª âª Had no lovin' since you know when âª âª You know I love you, yes, I do âª âª And I'm savin' all my loving just for you âª âª Need your lovin' and I need it bad âª âª Just like a dog when... âª Smile."
621,621,I think we're on TV.
622,622,Hello.
623,623,May we help you?
624,624,"Yeah, we're here to see our son, Danny Stetson."
625,625,There's nobody here by that name.
626,626,"Can we talk to someone in charge, please?"
627,627,"One moment, please."
628,628,Man: There's some people here who want to talk to Danny Stetson.
629,629,"Man on walkietalkie : Send them in, but they'll have to proceed on foot."
630,630,Okay.
631,631,"You can go on in, but I'm afraid you're gonna have to go in on foot."
632,632,"Well, thanks loads, pal, but we'd rather drive."
633,633,"Oh, you won't get that far, sir."
634,634,"You see, we've had to dig ditches in the road, and if you don't know where they are, your car'll fall in."
635,635,"Oh, shit."
636,636,"Come on, babe."
637,637,"I'm game if you are, huh?"
638,638,"Sure, sure."
639,639,Thanks a lot.
640,640,"Diana: Kevin, please."
641,641,Just wait a minute.
642,642,Please.
643,643,"Just hang on, hang on."
644,644,Why do you wear shoes like that?
645,645,"You can't walk in them, why do you wear them?"
646,646,"I wasn't planning to go for a nature hike, okay?"
647,647,"Hey, don't step on the butt."
648,648,Just walk right on by.
649,649,"Peace, peace."
650,650,"Come on, let's get there."
651,651,Mr. Stetson.
652,652,Hi. I'm Jacob.
653,653,And I'm Aaron.
654,654,What can we do for you?
655,655,What can you do for us?
656,656,"We're here to see our son, Danny."
657,657,"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Stetson, but he's no longer Danny."
658,658,He's now Joshua.
659,659,Joshua? What is all this Joshua bullshit?
660,660,"Look, I'm Danny's father and I want to talk to him right now!"
661,661,Joshua doesn't want to talk to you.
662,662,Who the hell are you?
663,663,King fucking Solomon?
664,664,I'm Neil Kirklander.
665,665,"As I said before, Joshua doesn't want to talk to you."
666,666,"Let him tell me, not you!"
667,667,"Maybe, maybe we could just see him for a minute."
668,668,"Please, please, he he might need something."
669,669,"Mrs. Stetson, Joshua doesn't need anything from either of you ever again."
670,670,"Now you hear me, and you hear me good."
671,671,"I want you to get my son out of here right now and I mean this instant, do you hear me?"
672,672,He belongs to me!
673,673,He's not your property anymore.
674,674,And I'm going to have to ask you both to leave immediately.
675,675,"We're gonna put your ass behind bars, my friend, and you can count on that."
676,676,"You think you own everything, don't you, Mr. Stetson?"
677,677,"We're just gonna talk to the cops about this, pal."
678,678,"Hey, Officer, look, they're trying to get What seems to be the problem, Mr. Kirklander?"
679,679,Wait a minute.
680,680,They've got my son in here.
681,681,He's trapped in this place.
682,682,"This man is trespassing, threatening my life, and terrorizing my staff."
683,683,"Officer, my name is Kevin Stetson and I want you to put that goddamn maniac there under arrest."
684,684,"Come on, let's move it, buddy."
685,685, What are you talk hey! Let me be.
686,686, Come on.
687,687,God damn it!
688,688,Diana: Kevin!
689,689,Kevin!
690,690,Stop it!
691,691,Danny?
692,692,I told you.
693,693,I told you to leave me alone.
694,694,Neil was right.
695,695,You're not interested in my spiritual welfare.
696,696,The both of you are dead.
697,697,And you just want me to die with you.
698,698,Danny...
699,699,"Danny, honey, please, just..."
700,700,"come home with us right now, please."
701,701,This is my home.
702,702,This is my family.
703,703,Go on back to your death and life.
704,704,"If you'll step right over here, please, sir."
705,705,"Thank you, thank you, Officer."
706,706,Up against this wall.
707,707,Thank you.
708,708,There's nothing we can do.
709,709,"Your son's an adult, Mr. Stetson."
710,710,"Here, there you go."
711,711,"Hell, he's old enough to get drafted."
712,712,"He's got civil rights, just like you and me."
713,713,The FBI couldn't get him out of there with a crowbar.
714,714,"They got him trapped in there, God damn it."
715,715,You know that and maybe I know that.
716,716,But that's the law.
717,717,We're helpless?
718,718,Is that what you're telling us?
719,719,Dad?
720,720,Did you find Danny?
721,721,Yeah... we found him.
722,722,Is he all right?
723,723,"He's fine, he's fine."
724,724,We'll talk about it in the morning.
725,725,But he's okay.
726,726,He's okay.
727,727,Go back to bed.
728,728,Go back to bed.
729,729,It's okay.
730,730,Mrs. Stetson?
731,731,"I'll get right to the point, folks."
732,732,"I know how to get Danny away from Homeland and back here with you, where he belongs."
733,733,How do you know where our son is?
734,734,"Well, do you think I just stumbled into your house by mistake?"
735,735,You take a...
736,736,"pretty mean picture there, Mr. Stetson."
737,737,"Mrs. Stetson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?"
738,738,Um Because one of my operatives took this picture three days ago.
739,739,That's Bradelbourough in the background where he's soliciting funds for them.
740,740,"Oh, Christ."
741,741,I am beat to shit.
742,742,I haven't slept in about 48 hours.
743,743,Got any coffee or a little bourbon?
744,744,"Uh, sure surely we do."
745,745,I'll get it.
746,746,Cream and two sugars.
747,747,"Or neat, whichever."
748,748,This is some digs you've got here.
749,749,We like it.
750,750,"Yeah, I live in a pisshole."
751,751,You guys could really make a difference.
752,752,I want you to have a pamphlet.
753,753,Take care of yourselves.
754,754,Have a good day.
755,755,"Hello, how you doing today?"
756,756,"Listen, I want to give you a flower."
757,757,"I work for the Community Rescue Project, would you like to make a contribution?"
758,758,I want you to make a small donation.
759,759,That's sizeable enough.
760,760,"And I want to thank you, have a great day."
761,761,"Hi, could I interrupt your day for just a minute?"
762,762,You have a lovely face and I bet you have a lovely spirit.
763,763, What's your name?
764,764, Eileen.
765,765," Eileen, my name is Joshua."
766,766,"I want to tell you something, Eileen, you can make a difference in the world today."
767,767,Take this rose and you make a difference.
768,768,Thank you very much.
769,769,"Here, let me give you one of these."
770,770,Have a great day.
771,771,"Danny: Sir, can I interrupt you for a moment?"
772,772,I know you're leading a busy life but I want to ask you a question.
773,773,Are you interested in the future?
774,774,Because I can tell you are.
775,775,You don't even have to answer that question.
776,776,It's hollow.
777,777,"You know, it's great the way that people trust you."
778,778,I guess that's because you're so quick to trust.
779,779,Like with Neil and me.
780,780,I could feel your strength and Neil's and...
781,781,I just let myself go.
782,782,Like when we first met...
783,783,you made believe you were attracted to me.
784,784,You made me want to follow you.
785,785,I was being loving towards you.
786,786,I know that.
787,787,I do.
788,788,I know that now.
789,789,It's like a you were trying to save me.
790,790,"Just trying to save me from... death and life without my even knowing it, really."
791,791,I don't have anything but good feelings for you.
792,792,"Yeah, I know."
793,793,You can see what's good in people.
794,794,You saw what was good in me.
795,795,"You know, the other side of me..."
796,796,the other side of me was really disappointed at first.
797,797,I used to wait for you to come for me at night and...
798,798,"You know, eventually I just let go of all that."
799,799,Then everything changed.
800,800,Not just my feelings have changed.
801,801,My body has changed.
802,802,I don't even shave now.
803,803,It's like that.
804,804,I hardly ever have my period anymore.
805,805,None of the girls do.
806,806,Why don't we see if we can get a seat over there?
807,807,Pratt: That's Barry Mills.
808,808,What a great kid.
809,809,"Mr. StraightAs, college student, like yours."
810,810,"It's always the bright ones, isn't it?"
811,811,"When his parents tried to get him out of Homeland, he tried to kill 'em."
812,812,Came at his own father with an ax.
813,813,Here's a picture of him right before I got him out.
814,814,"Here's Barry Mills six weeks later, after I cleaned out his mind and hung it up to dry."
815,815,That's...
816,816,"Estes Park, Colorado."
817,817,The nightmare was over.
818,818,The family was on vacation.
819,819,"Now, here's Debbie Cooper."
820,820,My little chubbette.
821,821,She fixed herself a homecooked abortion and ended up with Kirklander in his little ShangriLa in the woods.
822,822,Took me one hour to clean that mind out.
823,823, ...and the deprogramming...
824,824, What a sweetheart.
825,825,"...less painful than the experiences in Homeland, was it not?"
826,826,"Right, yeah."
827,827,"Uh, Mr. Pratt, I just wanted to thank you for saving me from the hell of cult life."
828,828,"Thank you, Debbie, for your courage."
829,829,Boy is she ever doing great now.
830,830,"She's got a job, and she's home."
831,831,"And this, of course, is father Neil Kirklander."
832,832,I am the worst enemy that this man has.
833,833,He once told me he would like to take a chainsaw to me.
834,834,Some man of God.
835,835,I have seen Homelanders eat dog shit at his command.
836,836,"See, he only likes to break down good kids from troubled homes and make them his."
837,837,"Mr. Pratt, Danny is not from a troubled home."
838,838,"We love him very much and, furthermore, I am not one bit crazy about the sound of your hanging out that boy's mind out to dry."
839,839,"Well, just what are you crazy about, Mrs. Stetson, the sound of your son snacking on dog's shit?"
840,840,"Oh, please."
841,841,I know.
842,842,"I bet when you went to Homeland, you tried to persuade Danny to come home."
843,843, Of course.
844,844, Am I right?
845,845,"When you're sick, do you heal yourself?"
846,846,"No, you call a physician."
847,847,Now these things are best left to professions.
848,848,Your son is probably from here by now.
849,849,Just one thing.
850,850,Not a word about this to anybody.
851,851,What are you talking about?
852,852,"Kidnapping, Mr. Stetson."
853,853,"Kidnapping carries Get an earful, kid?"
854,854,"Hey, about my costs, I just take expenses and a small fee."
855,855,"Yeah, I figured."
856,856,And that's cash.
857,857,It's hard to believe to look at them that they're damned.
858,858,"Well, on the surface they all look happy."
859,859,You and I can imagine the lies they're concealing.
860,860,"That's what the world's like, full of greed and corruption; only concerned with sex and money."
861,861,I used to lie all the time.
862,862,It's hard for me to even imagine you being part of death and life.
863,863,"Oh, she was worse than any of these people."
864,864,She?
865,865,I did terrible things.
866,866,I used to look for somebody who'd... really see me.
867,867,Somebody who'd look at me and... make me feel alive.
868,868,There were guys.
869,869,At first it seemed all right.
870,870,"But, of course, it was terrible."
871,871,"I was torn apart, really."
872,872,They call it making love.
873,873,But that's a lie.
874,874,Making love with somebody.
875,875,You're alone really.
876,876,Why?
877,877,Why can't somebody touch you?
878,878,And it just...
879,879,it just works.
880,880,"Look, I think you're remembering this with your old mind."
881,881,Don't.
882,882,That wasn't really you doing all those things.
883,883,The real part of you just wanted to be loved.
884,884,Neil understood that.
885,885,What was inside of me was so bad.
886,886,No.
887,887,"No, what what's inside a person like you could never be bad, really."
888,888,Do you really believe that?
889,889,I know it.
890,890,And I've known it since the first time I met you.
891,891,That's why I love you.
892,892,"I love you, Joshua."
893,893,Sometimes I think...
894,894,more than I should.
895,895,I know that too.
896,896,Oh!
897,897,"I used to dream like that, Joshua, out there."
898,898,"Rebecca Rebecca, Rebecca!"
899,899,Wake up.
900,900,Joshua.
901,901,"Come with me, Rebecca."
902,902,"Please, hurry."
903,903,"I told you, Joshua, Neil will understand."
904,904,Tell me.
905,905,"Oh, Neil, I've had these dreams; very sick dreams."
906,906,About Rebecca?
907,907,Yes.
908,908,The two of you are close to perfection.
909,909,So evil rises up to attack you.
910,910,"You're afraid your lust will destroy Rebecca's soul, aren't you Joshua?"
911,911,Yes.
912,912,And you want it.
913,913,"A part of you wants to become a whore in his hands, am I right?"
914,914,"In order to hate me and get a hold on him, am I right?"
915,915,Am I right?
916,916,Yes.
917,917,You can save her from all of this...
918,918,if you will pray as I tell you.
919,919,"Speak in tongues, I command you."
920,920,Speak in the language of angels.
921,921,Translate.
922,922,Thinking about sense objects will attach you to sense objects.
923,923,Grow attached and you become addicted.
924,924,Thwart your addiction and you become angry.
925,925,"Become angry, and you become confused."
926,926,Become confused and you forget the lesson of experience.
927,927,Forget the lesson of experience and you lose discrimination.
928,928,Lose discrimination and you miss life's only purpose.
929,929,"Neil, I was so lost a few minutes ago."
930,930,Now that we're here I feel I shall never lose you two.
931,931,"I thought you were incredibly bold when you prayed this morning, Joshua."
932,932,You grow in spiritual leaps and bounds every day.
933,933,"Oh, Neil, I could never work hard enough to repay all the love you've shown me."
934,934,"I chose the right name for you, Joshua."
935,935,For Joshua led his people into the promised land.
936,936,"Of all God's creatures, I find birds most miraculous."
937,937,"I want you to go to Denver, Joshua, and become the head elder of our Homeland community there."
938,938,"Why are you choosing me, Neil?"
939,939,There are many others here better equipped than I to lead.
940,940,Gabriel's been here for four years.
941,941,"Oh, Gabriel's a fine person."
942,942,But he doesn't have your advanced spirituality.
943,943,I know it's wrong to have favorites.
944,944,But I love you more than any of the rest.
945,945,Trust me.
946,946,You know what I see college as?
947,947,One big fuck farm.
948,948,"I mean, isn't today's crop the worst yet?"
949,949,Look at this gaggle of faggots.
950,950,"I mean, they're not beatniks."
951,951,They're not even hippies.
952,952,This generation doesn't even know what to call itself.
953,953,"Oh, here we go."
954,954,You see the truck?
955,955,"Okay, there's the boy."
956,956,He's the one going off with the flowers right now.
957,957,Shit.
958,958,"Uh, just stick with him."
959,959,Don't do anything yet.
960,960,We're going to sit tight.
961,961,"Pratt on walkietalkie: Okay, they're headed into the quadrangle."
962,962,"See if you two muscles can blend in, all right?"
963,963,You could've had him.
964,964,We'll have him again.
965,965,He was standing right there.
966,966,He'll be there again.
967,967,You had a chance and you screwed it up.
968,968, Out.
969,969, What?
970,970,You went to college.
971,971,You understand English.
972,972, I said get the fuck out.
973,973, What are you talking about?
974,974,"Look, I'm doing you a favor and I'm tired of your bullshit."
975,975,What do you mean you're doing me a favor?
976,976,I'm paying for your Goddamn favors!
977,977,I gave you the Goddamn money.
978,978,Abel to Baker.
979,979,Blow it off.
980,980,We're going home.
981,981,I'm tired of these fucking assholes.
982,982,"All right, wait a minute."
983,983,I'm sorry.
984,984,Excuse me?
985,985,Couldn't hear you.
986,986,A lot of static coming through.
987,987,I said I'm sorry.
988,988,We're on again.
989,989,"Rebecca, I always wanted to ask you what your real name was."
990,990, My old name?
991,991, Yeah.
992,992,Amy.
993,993,Amy...
994,994,it's a pretty name.
995,995,"I know I shouldn't be having these thoughts, but I don't want to be separated from you, Joshua."
996,996,"God help me, but I feel Neil's wrong."
997,997,Stop me if if I'm making you hate me by what I'm thinking.
998,998,I feel the same way.
999,999,"Danny Say it, say it, Amy."
1000,1000,"Just say it, whatever it is."
1001,1001,"Let's go, beau."
1002,1002, Help me.
1003,1003, Come on. Playtime's over.
1004,1004,Someone's trying to kidnap me.
1005,1005," Go, go!"
1006,1006, Danny: Help!
1007,1007,"Danny, it's me, Danny."
1008,1008,Rebecca! Rebecca!
1009,1009,Danny!
1010,1010,"Wipe that bitch out, Collins."
1011,1011,Get off.
1012,1012," Get off of me, you bitch."
1013,1013, Oh!
1014,1014," Collins: Oh, my God!"
1015,1015, Come on!
1016,1016,"Get back, pal, okay."
1017,1017,Don't get involved.
1018,1018,Help!
1019,1019,"Help me, please!"
1020,1020,They're kidnapping him!
1021,1021,Come on!
1022,1022,"Fine, go."
1023,1023,Danny!
1024,1024,Danny!
1025,1025,"Oh, God."
1026,1026,Get your goddamn hands off me.
1027,1027, I'll take care  Shut up!
1028,1028," Danny, Danny, listen."
1029,1029,"Danny, we're going to take you home."
1030,1030,We're going to make it all better.
1031,1031," Danny, I promise."
1032,1032,Danny.
1033,1033,Danny: No!
1034,1034,No! No!
1035,1035,Shut him up!
1036,1036,Jesus Christ.
1037,1037,Jesus Christ!
1038,1038,Goddamn you!
1039,1039,Pratt: Get him inside.
1040,1040,We're onto the enemy.
1041,1041,"Look, those cult bastards can show up any time."
1042,1042,Move this car as soon as we get upstairs.
1043,1043,"All right, come on."
1044,1044,"Kevin: Watch his head, watch his head."
1045,1045,"Pratt: All right, all right."
1046,1046,Pediatrics ward here.
1047,1047," Okay, everything ready?"
1048,1048, Yeah.
1049,1049,The doors and windows shut and nailed?
1050,1050,"You got the orange juice, the sleeping bags?"
1051,1051,Are the phones disconnected upstairs?
1052,1052,You said you weren't going to hurt him.
1053,1053,He's not hurt.
1054,1054,He's just resting from his long journey.
1055,1055,Collins: Kid's a lard ass.
1056,1056,Man: Next one's on me.
1057,1057,"Collins: Oh, Jesus."
1058,1058,Man: Look at this kid's eyes.
1059,1059,He's flipping out.
1060,1060,Collins: Goofy as a pee tortured boar.
1061,1061,Man: Think we have to take his cuffs off?
1062,1062,"Collins: Oh, shit, no."
1063,1063,If Pratt wants them off let him take them off.
1064,1064,I'll get his legs.
1065,1065,You get his mouth.
1066,1066, Stay on your toes.
1067,1067, Yeah.
1068,1068,When he gets loose he's going to ricochet around here like a tennis ball.
1069,1069," Okay, ready?"
1070,1070, Yep.
1071,1071,"Welcome home, peckerwood."
1072,1072,Here's Danny.
1073,1073,Chute number one.
1074,1074,Danny: Let me outta here!
1075,1075,Let me outta here!
1076,1076,"Let me outta here, you cowards!"
1077,1077,You cowards!
1078,1078,Let me outta here!
1079,1079,Let me out!
1080,1080,Let me out!
1081,1081,Let me out!
1082,1082,Let me out! Let me out!
1083,1083,Let me out! Let me out!
1084,1084,Please! Neil!
1085,1085,I know it sounds bad in there.
1086,1086,It's going to get a whole lot worse too.
1087,1087,"Danny: Neil, please save me!"
1088,1088,Rebecca!
1089,1089,"Oh, my God."
1090,1090,How could you do this to me?
1091,1091,Danny... honey.
1092,1092,Your father and I are only doing this because we love you.
1093,1093,Love me?
1094,1094,You don't even know what love is!
1095,1095,"Most of the world is suffering and you, you spend all your time kissing the asses of rich clients."
1096,1096,Love me?
1097,1097,"You, you live for greed, both of you."
1098,1098,Both of you are dead.
1099,1099,And I hate you!
1100,1100,I hate you!
1101,1101,"Danny, you don't know what you're saying."
1102,1102,They've taken your mind.
1103,1103,You you've been brainwashed.
1104,1104,Look at you.
1105,1105,You're pathetic.
1106,1106,You're weak.
1107,1107,You don't have the strength of God in you!
1108,1108,You believe in nothing.
1109,1109,And you're trying to take away my faith.
1110,1110,God will see you dead.
1111,1111,"Okay, kid, you said your piece."
1112,1112,"Can you leave us alone now, please?"
1113,1113,Would you please?
1114,1114,"No, don't don't leave me alone with this man."
1115,1115,He's going to torture me.
1116,1116,He's going to put chicken bones down my throat!
1117,1117,"Danny, please, it's going to okay."
1118,1118,"Mrs. Stetson, would you please."
1119,1119,Mom?
1120,1120,"Diana: Danny, please."
1121,1121,Dad?
1122,1122,"No, no."
1123,1123, Pratt: Lock it.
1124,1124,If I have to stay in this room...
1125,1125,six years...
1126,1126,I'm not leaving.
1127,1127,Joshua is dead on the floor and Danny is reborn.
1128,1128,Understand?
1129,1129,"Not till Joshua is dead and Danny is totally reborn, you understand?"
1130,1130,Not till Joshua is dead on the floor and Danny is totally reborn.
1131,1131, Do you understand?
1132,1132,Not till Joshua is dead and Danny is reborn.
1133,1133,Do you understand?
1134,1134,Rebecca: Lose discrimination and you miss life's only purpose.
1135,1135,Joshua.
1136,1136,"I love you, Joshua."
1137,1137,"I love you, Joshua."
1138,1138,Pratt: Do you understand?
1139,1139,"I love you, Joshua."
1140,1140,"I love you, Joshua."
1141,1141,"I love you, Joshua."
1142,1142,Do you understand?
1143,1143," Joshua is dead on the floor  I love you, Joshua."
1144,1144,Do you understand?
1145,1145,Do you understand?
1146,1146,Joshua is dead and Danny is totally reborn!
1147,1147,"Not till Joshua is dead and Danny is totally reborn, do you understand?"
1148,1148,Neil: ...is out there.
1149,1149,"and would love to destroy us, but they can't because we know the secret."
1150,1150,The end of duality.
1151,1151,The penetration of the infinite.
1152,1152,"Danny, are you listening?"
1153,1153,Danny?
1154,1154,Danny?
1155,1155,What is God but an end to duality?
1156,1156,Why do you think the world fears us?
1157,1157,Neil and Pratt: Because they know how strong we are.
1158,1158,Be strong.
1159,1159,Feed yourself.
1160,1160,Love...
1161,1161,Don't falter.
1162,1162,Don't waver for me.
1163,1163,"For me, don't fail."
1164,1164,Neil: And please don't die.
1165,1165,Thinking about sense objects He's in deep.
1166,1166,He's in very deep.
1167,1167,I don't even think he can hear me.
1168,1168,Forget the lesson of experience and you lose discrimination.
1169,1169,Lose discrimination and you miss life's only purpose.
1170,1170,You are pissing me off!
1171,1171,Eh?
1172,1172,This kid is really pissing me off.
1173,1173,Watch this.
1174,1174,"How do you like this, you little fruit?"
1175,1175,Huh?
1176,1176,"You like it, boy?"
1177,1177,You like it?
1178,1178,Neil!
1179,1179,Grab him.
1180,1180,Get his arm.
1181,1181,Neil!
1182,1182,I got your Neil.
1183,1183,Cocksucker.
1184,1184, Stay down.
1185,1185,Do I detect a glimpse of response?
1186,1186,"Danny, Danny."
1187,1187,"Hey, you can't go in there."
1188,1188, Get out of my way!
1189,1189,Hey!
1190,1190,Pratt: Talk to me!
1191,1191,"Have a dialogue with me, Danny."
1192,1192,Get out of here.
1193,1193,Leave this to me.
1194,1194,Get him out of this room.
1195,1195,Get him out!
1196,1196," Daddy, they're hurting me."
1197,1197," Danny, talk to me."
1198,1198," Daddy, they're hurting me."
1199,1199, Let him go.
1200,1200,Get out of this fucking room!
1201,1201,I said let him go!
1202,1202,Let me out!
1203,1203,Let me out!
1204,1204, Come on.
1205,1205, Danny!
1206,1206, Come on.
1207,1207," Oh, my God."
1208,1208,What did I tell you?
1209,1209,He was screaming.
1210,1210,I thought he was hurt.
1211,1211,"What, you're afraid it's getting a little rough in there?"
1212,1212,"That's because if I want to reach this kid, first I have got to break him."
1213,1213,"Listen, I would like nothing better than to be able to sit down with him and have a nice little cup of tea and a chat."
1214,1214,I would like to be able to point out to him in a nice and civilized way that he can have a better life with you than with that asswipe Kirklander.
1215,1215,But he wouldn't believe me.
1216,1216,"Even if he wasn't too spaced out to hear me, he wouldn't believe me."
1217,1217,"And if you want to know the fucking truth, I wouldn't believe me either."
1218,1218,"Now, nail those fucking windows shut."
1219,1219,"I know you're in there, Danny."
1220,1220,Now come out.
1221,1221,God watches us.
1222,1222,He is with us.
1223,1223,"Listen to me, Danny, I know you're there."
1224,1224,"Listen to me, listen to me."
1225,1225,Neil: I know you're there.
1226,1226,Pratt: ...picture of Neil Kirklander.
1227,1227, You hear me?
1228,1228, Listen to me.
1229,1229,Neil: God watches.
1230,1230,He is with us.
1231,1231,"I know you're there, Joshua."
1232,1232,Listen to me.
1233,1233,"You know what this is, don't you?"
1234,1234,"The Bible, God's rules and regulations."
1235,1235,"Now even your precious Neil admits to that, doesn't he?"
1236,1236,"Hey, wake up."
1237,1237,Now would you please tell me where it says in this book it says that lying is good?
1238,1238,"And yet every time you collect for charities that don't exist, you are lying for Neil Kirklander."
1239,1239,Huh?
1240,1240,"And Kirklander told you to hate, to hate your parents, to hate your brother."
1241,1241,"Hate your enemies, hate everything."
1242,1242,But love saved you.
1243,1243,Could you please tell me where in this book it tells you to hate?
1244,1244,It seems to me that God commands us to love our enemies and to honor our father and our mother.
1245,1245,"So, if Neil is right, then God is wrong."
1246,1246,"Do you hear me, Danny?"
1247,1247,"Neil: You are Joshua, a warrior."
1248,1248, Danny?
1249,1249, Neil: Danny's dead.
1250,1250,"Do you hear me, Danny?"
1251,1251,Do you hear me?
1252,1252,I don't want to!
1253,1253,What's the problem?
1254,1254,Can Joshua come out and play?
1255,1255,"Get off my property, you goddamn creeps."
1256,1256,Get the hell outta here!
1257,1257,Where's Joshua?
1258,1258,We want him.
1259,1259,"I'll give you Joshua, you sons of bitches."
1260,1260,Sons of bitches!
1261,1261,"Get out of here, you sons of bitches!"
1262,1262," No, no, you don't."
1263,1263,"Come on, Collins."
1264,1264,Man: Get him.
1265,1265,What do you want here?
1266,1266,"Please, just just leave."
1267,1267,Joshua!
1268,1268,"No, God damn it, no!"
1269,1269,Pratt!
1270,1270, Tell me where he is!
1271,1271, Get out of my house!
1272,1272, No.
1273,1273, Get out.
1274,1274,"This Community Rescue Project, they're ever, ever benefitting  Collins?"
1275,1275, Rebecca: Joshua!
1276,1276,Pratt: What the hell is going on down there?
1277,1277,"Collins, where are you?"
1278,1278,Diana: Get out of here.
1279,1279,Get outta here now!
1280,1280,Rebecca!
1281,1281,Now!
1282,1282, Rebecca!
1283,1283, Joshua!
1284,1284,"Rebecca, Rebecca!"
1285,1285,Kevin! Pratt!
1286,1286,Somebody please!
1287,1287,Get off me.
1288,1288,Rebecca!
1289,1289,Joshua!
1290,1290,"Rebecca, Rebecca!"
1291,1291,Do you know what it feels like to be hit very hard in the solar plexus?
1292,1292,It doesn't feel like this.
1293,1293,And it doesn't feel like this.
1294,1294,It feels like this.
1295,1295,Now as for you two scabby little harlots...
1296,1296,Avon calling.
1297,1297,Joshua!
1298,1298,You think you can keep me here?
1299,1299,You are as stupid as you are evil.
1300,1300,Neil sent my brothers and sisters here to bring you to your knees.
1301,1301,These these torture tactics of yours cannot match the power of his love.
1302,1302,"You've started talking pretty good, haven't you?"
1303,1303,"Pratt: Is that one of your sisters, huh?"
1304,1304,What was her name?
1305,1305,Rebecca?
1306,1306,Did you get to hug her like that back at the farm?
1307,1307,Shut up.
1308,1308,Did Neil let you express yourself physically back at the farm?
1309,1309,You are a pervert.
1310,1310,You live for greed.
1311,1311,You live for sexual pleasure.
1312,1312,I live in a trailer park and I haven't been laid in a month.
1313,1313,At Homeland we've grown beyond all that personal gratification.
1314,1314,Bullshit!
1315,1315,You got shut down.
1316,1316,You're a normal kid.
1317,1317,"You're a little bit of a stiff, but you wanted her."
1318,1318,And just maybe she wanted you too.
1319,1319,But Neil wouldn't allow that.
1320,1320,Neil has to have total control.
1321,1321,He calls it spiritual love but what it boils down to is you have to love Neil and hate everybody else.
1322,1322, I'm not listening to this.
1323,1323," Well, that's good, because I don't feel like talking to you tonight anyway."
1324,1324,"My head, my head, my head."
1325,1325,"What, it hurts?"
1326,1326,"Yeah, it hurts."
1327,1327,Good.
1328,1328,"Hey, hey, what is this, a country club?"
1329,1329,Go on up there.
1330,1330,I need a break.
1331,1331,"I've been talking nonstop all night, come on."
1332,1332,"Come on, get off your asses."
1333,1333,Come on.
1334,1334,How's it going?
1335,1335,"Well, I'm chipping away."
1336,1336,I think he's going to crack soon.
1337,1337,Better crack soon before those loonies from last night have the cops here for breakfast.
1338,1338,"Listen, if I ever do break this kid, don't let him out of your sight."
1339,1339,Kirklander doesn't like to lose.
1340,1340,They want him back real bad.
1341,1341,And if they ever get him again I promise you that's the last you're ever going to see him.
1342,1342,Nobody gets out twice.
1343,1343,"Well, what do you suggest that we do, then?"
1344,1344,Hire armed guards to live with us for the rest of our lives?
1345,1345,"What I suggest you do is to give him something to live for, something to believe in."
1346,1346,"You... younger brother, do you believe in something?"
1347,1347,What?
1348,1348,I want to have a lot of money.
1349,1349,"I want to learn how to hunt and fish so that if food runs out, I'll know how to get mine."
1350,1350,That's it?
1351,1351,You don't believe that America is your home and that God loves you and your parents too?
1352,1352,I want to have a big apartment on top of a big building so I won't have to breathe air pollution.
1353,1353,I want to have a place where I can go so nobody else can find me.
1354,1354,So nobody could ask me stuff or take stuff away.
1355,1355,I want to survive and everybody better let me alone.
1356,1356,I don't understand.
1357,1357,What do you want me to do?
1358,1358,Whatever happens you just play along and trust me.
1359,1359,"Joshua, you want to end this horse shit right now?"
1360,1360,You just give me three minutes and you listen to me.
1361,1361,I mean really listen.
1362,1362,And you can walk out of that room either way.
1363,1363,You have my word.
1364,1364,And I have never welched on a deal in my life.
1365,1365, You're right.
1366,1366,"He spends his life kissing the asses of rich clients, you're right."
1367,1367,He lives for greed.
1368,1368,He is death in life itself.
1369,1369,"So, fuck him."
1370,1370, Fuck your father.
1371,1371,He's dirt dirt.
1372,1372,He's a crumpled piece of human shit for you to step on.
1373,1373,"Come on, I am saving you from the man who paid to have you tortured, now you step on him."
1374,1374,Step on him.
1375,1375,Come on.
1376,1376,He's shit.
1377,1377,Kill him.
1378,1378,Kill your father.
1379,1379,I spit on the cocksucker.
1380,1380,Kill him.
1381,1381,Kill your father.
1382,1382, Kill him!
1383,1383, Stop it!
1384,1384,Stop it!
1385,1385,Stop it!
1386,1386,"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
1387,1387,Please.
1388,1388,Who are you telling to stop?
1389,1389,Neil Kirklander.
1390,1390,That's who you're telling to stop.
1391,1391,"Neil, who taught you that hate was love."
1392,1392,"It was Neil hating your father and hurting him and forcing you, Danny, to do the same thing."
1393,1393,Yes?
1394,1394,Your father who...
1395,1395,"gave you everything he could, yes?"
1396,1396,Yes?
1397,1397,Yes.
1398,1398,You love him?
1399,1399,Danny...
1400,1400,"you love him, yes?"
1401,1401,Yes.
1402,1402,There's somebody here to see you.
1403,1403,"Hi, Mom."
1404,1404,Hi.
1405,1405,I'm really sorry...
1406,1406,I'm really sorry.
1407,1407,"Dad, I love you."
1408,1408,I'm so sorry.
1409,1409,All right.
1410,1410,It's gonna be okay.
1411,1411,It's gonna be okay.
1412,1412,"Diana: Dan, you all right?"
1413,1413,Yeah.
1414,1414,"Yeah, I'm fine."
1415,1415,"Diana: I agree, except that it's awfully raw Diana: It's got to be, it's got to be the truth."
1416,1416,Not this not this not the hype.
1417,1417,"Pratt: Okay, listen to me, admittedly it is difficult stuff to watch."
1418,1418,But he's a great kid and it's a great to see him in this condition.
1419,1419,But I assure you the last thing I want to be is some media talk show star.
1420,1420,"But Griffin tells me they want to do a show with me and with some of the families behind the stories like yourselves, victories against the cults."
1421,1421,Television?
1422,1422,No.
1423,1423,There would be some money of course but more importantly they feel it would help other families less lucky than you were.
1424,1424,"And it might, it might."
1425,1425,"Listen, Kevin, it really might So, let's put me on television."
1426,1426,Let's have me tell America that all the feelings that got me into Homeland are sick and perverted and wrong.
1427,1427,"Hi, Danny."
1428,1428,"Just say that they lied to you, that's all."
1429,1429,I didn't go up there because I believed them in the first place.
1430,1430,I went up there because I wanted I just wanted to believe.
1431,1431,"Honey, you don't deny you were wrong, do you?"
1432,1432,"Come on, Danny."
1433,1433,I got captured up there because I I cared about someone.
1434,1434,Because there was a moment up there when I just I just cared about everyone.
1435,1435,I wanted to love people.
1436,1436,I wanted to love people.
1437,1437,"Yeah, that's stupid."
1438,1438,That that's stupid.
1439,1439,"That's crazy, huh?"
1440,1440,"Yeah, yeah, well, I can't say those feelings are wrong."
1441,1441,"I can't, and I won't."
1442,1442,There are 100 reasons why I got caught up there.
1443,1443,"What, I'm crazy, they're bad, huh?"
1444,1444,It's not that simple.
1445,1445,It was really stupid exposing him to this discussion.
1446,1446,I thought he was further along.
1447,1447,Usually at this stage Are you saying that he'll go back?
1448,1448,"You heard him defending his love for Kirklander, didn't you?"
1449,1449,It sounds like they're still in him.
1450,1450,"I think it's a family matter now, Mr. Pratt."
1451,1451,You weren't too successful before.
1452,1452,"Well, that that was before."
1453,1453,This is now.
1454,1454,"We're very grateful, Mr. Pratt, but I I think it's time you left."
1455,1455,"Danny, we have to talk."
1456,1456,Danny.
1457,1457,"Sure, Mom."
1458,1458,"Honey, what's bothering me look, I need to understand what you meant when you said that you didn't regret having certain feelings that got you into Homeland."
1459,1459,"Just like I said, Mom, there's somebody I cared about there."
1460,1460,Kirklander?
1461,1461,No.
1462,1462,"Oh, oh, dear."
1463,1463,"Oh, dear. Oh, dear."
1464,1464,Are we are we talking about your little friend about the girl?
1465,1465,"Shut up, Mother."
1466,1466,"Now, you just wait a minute."
1467,1467,Wait just one minute.
1468,1468,"See I've I sacrificed most of my life on that holy alter that they call motherhood, right?"
1469,1469,"Always putting you first, your needs, your life, and I thought now that you were grown maybe we could get on with our own lives."
1470,1470,But did you ever think about that?
1471,1471,"No, you threw that away, just scuttled that."
1472,1472,"Well, tell me something, what about me?"
1473,1473, What about me?
1474,1474, Diana.
1475,1475,"No, no, no, no listen."
1476,1476,Don't you see what's hanging him up and us up and turning all of our lives into some holy hell is the young man's abdominal twitch over some smallchange syphilitic hippy trash.
1477,1477,Don't you dare!
1478,1478,Don't you dare!
1479,1479,Don't you dare!
1480,1480,Goddamn you!
1481,1481, Don't you dare!
1482,1482, Don't ever touch her again.
1483,1483,Don't ever touch her again!
1484,1484,Don't ever touch her again.
1485,1485,Don't ever touch her again.
1486,1486,"Kevin, we've become part of something we don't even understand."
1487,1487,We're going to get it back Danny.
1488,1488,I'm going to make a breakthrough with Sean.
1489,1489,I promise.
1490,1490,I don't know...
1491,1491,I don't know.
1492,1492,I just feel stripped.
1493,1493,I feel like I've been slowly raped.
1494,1494,"Everything's gone, all our plans."
1495,1495,What are you talking about?
1496,1496,I don't know.
1497,1497,To be happy.
1498,1498,Judith?
1499,1499,"It's me, Joshua."
1500,1500,Danny.
1501,1501,My name is Danny.
1502,1502,Go away.
1503,1503,Rebecca wants to see you.
1504,1504,I hoped you'd come.
1505,1505,"You knew I'd come, Amy."
1506,1506,"Danny Danny, I love you."
1507,1507,Nothing makes sense anymore.
1508,1508,It's awful without you.
1509,1509,"Well, say something."
1510,1510,Say that you don't feel the same way about me.
1511,1511,Say that that that you want me to go away and leave you alone.
1512,1512,"Oh, God."
1513,1513,Go away and leave you alone?
1514,1514,"I love you, Amy."
1515,1515,I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
1516,1516,I love you...
1517,1517,I love you!
1518,1518,I love you so much it hurts all over.
1519,1519,"Oh, Danny, I love you."
1520,1520,"Danny, Danny, leave."
1521,1521,What?
1522,1522,"Danny, it's Neil."
1523,1523,I'm not going to lie for him anymore.
1524,1524,Get out of here.
1525,1525,You don't know how angry he is.
1526,1526,"No, I'm not going anywhere without you."
1527,1527," Please, Danny, go."
1528,1528, No!
1529,1529,I'm not going anywhere without you.
1530,1530,"I've missed you, Joshua."
1531,1531,Come home.
1532,1532,"No, Neil."
1533,1533,Rebecca...
1534,1534,I want to talk to Joshua alone.
1535,1535,Amy... stay with me.
1536,1536,"Joshua, I love you."
1537,1537,"Get away from me, Neil."
1538,1538,We don't need you anymore.
1539,1539,"Goodbye, Neil."
1540,1540,âª I hope we never lose it âª âª Now that we've come so far âª Time is there if we choose it âª âª For everything we are âª We're so good together I will hold to you forever âª âª You're the light in the dark along the way âª âª So please be where I can find you âª âª In the dark along the way âª We will carry through together âª âª Till we see the break of day âª âª If there's life beyond these shadows âª âª It's in every word you say âª And I need you in the dark along the way âª âª Look at the road behind us âª Trouble we had to see âª Plenty of dark to blind us to what the world could be âª âª If there's a silver lining âª âª It's where our souls are shining âª âª They will light through the dark along the way âª âª So please be where I can find you âª âª In the dark along the way âª We will carry through together âª âª Till we see the break of day âª âª If there's life beyond these shadows âª âª It's in every word you say âª So please be there in the dark along the way âª e we could get on with our own lives.
1541,1541,But did you ever think about that?
1542,1542,"No, you threw that away, just scuttled that."
1543,1543,"Well, tell me something, what about me?"
1544,1544, What about me?
1545,1545, Diana.
1546,1546,"No, no, no, no listen."
1547,1547,Don't you see what's hanging him up and us up and turning all of our lives into some holy hell is the young man's abdominal twitch over some smallchange syphilitic hippy trash.
1548,1548,Don't you dare!
1549,1549,Don't you dare!
1550,1550,Don't you dare!
1551,1551,Goddamn you!

1555,1555,Don't ever touch her again.
1556,1556,Don't ever touch her again.
1557,1557,"Kevin, we've become part of something we don't even understand."
1558,1558,We're going to get it back... Danny.
1559,1559,I'm going to make a breakthrough with Sean.

1570,1570,"It's me, Joshua."
1571,1571,Danny.
1572,1572,My name is Danny.
1573,1573,Go away.
1574,1574,Rebecca wants to see you.
1575,1575,I hoped you'd come.
1576,1576,"You knew I'd come, Amy."
1577,1577,Danny...
1578,1578,"Danny, I love you."
1579,1579,Nothing makes sense anymore.
1580,1580,It's awful without you.
1581,1581,"Well, say something."
1582,1582,Say that you don't feel the same way about me.
1583,1583,Say that... that...
1584,1584,that you want me to go away and leave you alone.
1585,1585,God.
1586,1586,Go away and leave you alone?
1587,1587,"I love you, Amy."
1588,1588,I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
1589,1589,I love you...
1590,1590,I love you!
1591,1591,I love you so much it hurts all over.
1592,1592,"Danny, I love you."
1593,1593,"Danny, Danny, leave."
1594,1594,What?
1595,1595,"Danny, it's Neil."
1596,1596,I'm not going to lie for him anymore.
1597,1597,Get out of here.
1598,1598,You don't know how angry he is.
1599,1599,"No, I'm not going anywhere without you."
1600,1600," Please, Danny, go."
1601,1601, No!
1602,1602,I'm not going anywhere without you.
1603,1603,"I've missed you, Joshua."
1604,1604,Come home.
1605,1605,"No, Neil."
1606,1606,Rebecca...
1607,1607,I want to talk to Joshua alone.
1608,1608,Amy... stay with me.
1609,1609,"Joshua, I love you."
1610,1610,"Get away from me, Neil."
1611,1611,We don't need you anymore.
1612,1612,"Goodbye, Neil."
