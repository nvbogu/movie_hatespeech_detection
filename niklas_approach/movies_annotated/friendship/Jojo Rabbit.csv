0,0,Jojo Betzler.
1,1,Ten years old.
2,2,"Today, you join the ranks of the Jungvolk in a very special training weekend."
3,3,It's going to be intense.
4,4,"But today, you become a man."
5,5,"I swear to devote all my energies and my strength to the savior of our country, Adolf Hitler."
6,6,I am willing and ready to give up my life for him.
7,7,So help me God.
8,8,"Yes, that's right."
9,9," Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?"
10,10, Snake mind.
11,11," And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?"
12,12, Wolf body.
13,13," Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?"
14,14, Panther courage.
15,15," And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?"
16,16, A German soul.
17,17,"Yeah, man. You're ready."
18,18, Adolf.
19,19, Hmm?
20,20,I don't think I can do this.
21,21,Was?
22,22,Of course you can.
23,23,"Sure, you're a little bit scrawny and a bit unpopular and you can't tie your shoelaces even though you're ten years old But you're still the bestest, most loyal little Nazi I've ever met."
24,24,Not to mention the fact you're really goodlooking.
25,25,"So, you're gonna get out there and you're gonna have a great time, okay?"
26,26, Okay.
27,27, That's the spirit. Okay.
28,28,"Heil me, man."
29,29,Heil Hitler.
30,30,What? You can heil me better than that.
31,31, Heil Hitler.
32,32, No...
33,33,Just throw it away.
34,34,Don't even think about it.
35,35, Heil Hitler.
36,36," No, you're overthinking it."
37,37, Heil Hitler.
38,38," Heil ""Hitterler."" Who's ""Hitterler?"" Do you even speak German?"
39,39,  Heil Hitler.
40,40, That's not a heil.
41,41,This is a heil. Heil!
42,42, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler.
43,43, Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler!
44,44, Heil Hitler.
45,45, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
46,46,"Ooh, that's it."
47,47,You've got it. Heil Hitler.
48,48, Have a great day! You're gonna be the best.
49,49, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
50,50, Heil Hitler! You can do it.
51,51, Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
52,52,Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
53,53,Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
54,54,Heil Hitler!
55,55,Whoa!
56,56,"âª Oh, komm doch, komm zu mir âª  Heil Hitler."
57,57,âª Du nimmst mir der Verstand âª  Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler.
58,58,"âª Oh, komm doch, komm zu mir âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Oh, du bist so schÃ¶n âª âª SchÃ¶n wie ein Diamant âª Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler."
59,59,Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler.
60,60,âª Ich will mit dir gehen âª  Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler.
61,61,Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler.
62,62,"âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª  Heil Hitler, Yorki."
63,63," Heil Hitler, Jojo."
64,64, Are you ready for the best weekend ever?
65,65," Yes, I am."
66,66,Let's go.
67,67,"âª Das war noch nie bei einer Anderen âª  âª Einmal so, Einmal so âª âª Einmal so âª âª Oh, du bist so schÃ¶n âª âª SchÃ¶n wie ein Diamant âª âª Ich will mit dir gehen âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª âª Komm, gib mir deine Hand âª Heil! Heil! Heil!"
68,68,"Heil Hitler, guys."
69,69,Heil Hitler!
70,70,"Jungvolk, welcome to the Hitlerjugend training weekend."
71,71,In which we will make men and women of you all.
72,72,My name is Captain Klenzendorf.
73,73,You may call me Captain K.
74,74,Captain K. Whoo!
75,75,Ja. And this is SubOfficer Finkel.
76,76,This is FrÃ¤ulein Rahm.
77,77,"Hey. Heil Hitler, everyone."
78,78,So a little about me.
79,79,Who am I?
80,80,And why am I here talking to a bunch of little tittygrabbers instead of leading my men into battle towards glorious death? Great question.
81,81,I've asked it myself every day since Operation Screw Up where I lost a perfectly good eye in a totally preventable enemy attack.
82,82,"And according to my superiors, you need two eyes to be a meaningful part of the war effort."
83,83,Can twoeyed people do this?
84,84, Jesus.
85,85," Over the next two days, you little critters will get to experience some of the things that the mighty German army goes through every day."
86,86,"And even though it would appear our country's on the back foot and there really isn't much hope in us winning this war, apparently we're doing just fine."
87,87,Anyway. You boys have all been issued with your Deutsches Jungvolk daggers.
88,88,These are very special and expensive weapons.
89,89,You should never be without them.
90,90,And don't try to stab each other.
91,91,No stabbing!
92,92,No stabbing.
93,93,This is your first step towards being men.
94,94,"Today you boys will be involved in such activities as marching, bayonet drills, grenadethrowing, trenchdigging, mapreading, gas defense, camouflage, ambush techniques, war games, firing guns, and blowing stuff up."
95,95,"The girls will practice important womanly duties such as dressing wounds, making beds, and learning how to get pregnant."
96,96,Aw.
97,97,I've had 18 kids for Germany.
98,98,Such a great year to be a girl.
99,99,All right. Let's get to it.
100,100,Come on.
101,101,Go!
102,102,God help me.
103,103,"âª Well, when I'm lyin' in my bed at night âª Go, go, go!"
104,104,"âª Nothin' ever seems to turn out right âª âª I don't want to grow up âª Three, two, one, swastika!"
105,105,âª How do you move in a world of fog âª Come on!
106,106,Pull it! Come on!
107,107,âª Makes me wish that I could be a dog âª Aaah! Aaah!
108,108,"âª Well, when I see the price that you pay âª âª I don't ever want to be that way âª âª I don't want to grow up âª  Now finish him."
109,109," Don't, no, no!"
110,110,âª The only thing to live for is today âª  Fangs.
111,111," Fangs, ja."
112,112, Serpent tongue.
113,113," Serpent's tongue, ja."
114,114, Scales.
115,115," Ja, scales."
116,116,"Because, once upon a time, a Jewish man mated with a fish."
117,117,Whoa!
118,118,"We, Aryans, are one thousand times more civilized and advanced than any other race."
119,119,"Now, get your things together, kids."
120,120,It's time to burn some books.
121,121,Yeah!
122,122,"âª Comb their hair and shine their shoes âª âª I don't want to grow up âª âª Stay around my old hometown âª âª I don't want to put no money down âª âª I don't want to get me a big old loan âª âª Work them fingers to the bone âª âª I don't want to float a broom âª âª Fall in love and get married, then boom âª âª How the hell did it get here so soon? âª âª I don't want to grow up âª Jews sound scary, huh?"
123,123,Not to me.
124,124,"If I met one, I'd kill it like that."
125,125,Like... that.
126,126,But how would you know if you saw one?
127,127,They could look just like us.
128,128,I'd feel its head for horns.
129,129,And they smell like brussels sprouts.
130,130,"Oh, yeah. I forgot about the brussels sprouts bit."
131,131,Imagine catching one and giving it to Hitler.
132,132,That'd be a surefire way to get into his personal guards.
133,133,Then we would become best friends.
134,134,I thought I was your best friend.
135,135,"Yorki, you're my secondbest friend."
136,136,First place is reserved for the FÃ¼hrer.
137,137,"So, unless you're Hitler hiding in a fat, little boy's body..."
138,138,I'd be happy with second place.
139,139,I guess I'm just a kid in a fat kid's body.
140,140,Case closed.
141,141,Raah! Raah! Raah!
142,142,"When you stand before the enemy and have to end his life, which of you will have the stomach to do this?"
143,143,Good.
144,144,There is no room in Hitler's army for those that lack strength.
145,145,We want hardened warriors.
146,146,Those that are prepared to kill at will.
147,147,Can you do this?
148,148, Yes.
149,149, Ja.
150,150,Johannes.
151,151,Can you kill?
152,152,Pfff. Of course.
153,153,I love killing.
154,154,Good. Come here.
155,155,Don't be scared. Come on.
156,156,Good.
157,157,Kill it.
158,158,Huh?
159,159,Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.
160,160,Or are you scared?
161,161,I'm not scared. I... I just...
162,162,Now.
163,163,Place both hands around its neck and then one hard twist.
164,164,"He might scream, but we'll just use the boot to finish it off."
165,165,Kill. Kill.
166,166,Kill. Kill.
167,167,Kill. Kill.
168,168,Kill. Kill. Kill.
169,169,Kill.
170,170,Kill. Kill.
171,171,Kill. Kill.
172,172,Kill. Kill. Kill.
173,173,Kill. Kill. Kill.
174,174,Kill. Kill. Kill.
175,175," Shoo! Come on, shoo."
176,176," Hey! Hey, hey."
177,177,Good shot.
178,178,You are a coward.
179,179,Just like your father.
180,180,He... He's not a coward.
181,181, He's fighting in Italy.
182,182, Really?
183,183,But no one has heard from him in two years.
184,184,He is a deserting coward.
185,185,He's scared and so are you.
186,186,You're as scared as a little rabbit.
187,187,Scared little rabbit.
188,188,"Maybe we should snap your neck, too?"
189,189,Jojo the rabbit.
190,190,Jojo Rabbit.
191,191,Jojo Rabbit.
192,192,Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
193,193,Poor Jojo.
194,194,"What's wrong, little man?"
195,195," Hi, Adolf."
196,196, Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?
197,197,What was all that about?
198,198,They wanted me to kill it.
199,199,I'm sorry. I couldn't.
200,200,Don't worry about it.
201,201,I couldn't care less.
202,202,But now they call me a scared rabbit.
203,203,Let them say whatever they want.
204,204,People used to say a lot of nasty things about me.
205,205,"""Oh, this guy's a lunatic."" ""Oh, look at that psycho."
206,206,"He's gonna get us all killed."" I'm gonna let you in on a little secret."
207,207,The rabbit is no coward.
208,208,"The humble little bunny faces a dangerous world every day, hunting carrots for his family, for his country."
209,209,My empire will be full of all animals.
210,210,"Lions, giraffes, zebras, rhinoceroses, octopuses, rhinoctopuses."
211,211,Even the mighty rabbit.
212,212,Cigarette?
213,213,"Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke."
214,214,Let me give you some really good advice.
215,215,Be the rabbit.
216,216,The humble bunny can outwit all of his enemies.
217,217,He's brave and sneaky and strong.
218,218,Be the rabbit.
219,219,Jojo!
220,220,"Are you all right, Jojo?"
221,221,Who were you talking to?
222,222,Nobody.
223,223,"Oh, I thought you were crying."
224,224,Are you a teardrop specialist?
225,225,No.
226,226,Case closed.
227,227,"Now, it's time for Jojo to show those stick insects who is the real cowardly rabbit."
228,228,"I'm sorry, what are you talking about?"
229,229,Never mind.
230,230,"Jojo, where are you going?"
231,231,To be the rabbit!
232,232,Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
233,233,Hunting carrots. Jojo Rabbit.
234,234,"Hey, this is amazing."
235,235,We're like two human antelopes.
236,236,"Now, lads, each of you will be given the opportunity to ignite and throw a grenade."
237,237,I will personally be supervising each of you to make sure you don't blow your eyes out or something.
238,238,"All right, who's first?"
239,239,Klaus.
240,240,Shit.
241,241,Shit!
242,242,Don't do that.
243,243,Jojo. Jojo.
244,244,Finkel! Finkel!
245,245,"Jojo, Jojo."
246,246,OM Gott.
247,247,He looks like a Picasso painting.
248,248,His mother's going to kill me.
249,249,My darling cub.
250,250,"Hey, kid."
251,251,"Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm."
252,252,Mmm. My darling little cub.
253,253,Why so happy?
254,254,Your son is ugly like a monster.
255,255,Hey. You're no monster.
256,256,"Besides, your scars will heal, and you'll get most of the movement back in your leg."
257,257,But I'll never be in Hitler's personal guards.
258,258,"Ah, you're fine as you are."
259,259,I'm just happy to have you back home. Hmm?
260,260,"Mama Lion worries about her cub, especially when Papa Lion isn't here."
261,261,Or Inge Lion.
262,262,Or Inge Lion.
263,263,"You grab the rabbit by the tail, wrap it around his ear, tie it all up and then stuff him back down the hole."
264,264,"Now then, let's get on our way, huh?"
265,265,I think getting out of the house will do wonders for your recuperation.
266,266,I don't want to go out there.
267,267,What? Don't be silly.
268,268,Of course you do.
269,269,I look stupid.
270,270,People will stare.
271,271,"Enjoy the attention, kid."
272,272,Not everyone's lucky enough to look stupid.
273,273,"I, for one, am cursed to look incredibly attractive."
274,274,"Now, you're going to pluck up your courage, walk out that door and have an incredible adventure."
275,275,Okay?
276,276,Okay.
277,277,"Field Marshal Jojo, you're our top man."
278,278,Prepare to leave the house.
279,279,Is it dangerous?
280,280,Extremely.
281,281, Heil Hitler.
282,282," Oh, Jesus."
283,283,Hey!
284,284," Looking good, kid."
285,285, Heil Hitler!
286,286,"Frau Betzler, you're looking fetching as usual."
287,287,"Okay, wow."
288,288,It's because of you my son can't walk properly and has a messedup face.
289,289,He stole my hand grenade.
290,290," Just took it...   Ja, ja."
291,291,"So, you are going to look after him while I'm at work, hmm?"
292,292,Make sure he has a job and feels included. Got it?
293,293,"Got it. Ja, I really got it."
294,294,Good.
295,295,"Guys, this is Johannes Betzler."
296,296,The kid I told you about.
297,297,"Remember, he stole a hand grenade and blew himself up and as a result I got demoted for negligence."
298,298,Now I get to work in this office with all these wonderful kids.
299,299,"So, Jojo."
300,300,I'm sure we can figure out something for you to do.
301,301, Oh!
302,302, Ideas?
303,303, Ja.
304,304, Guys?
305,305,Ja. Ja.
306,306,"Okay, well, we need somebody to walk the clones."
307,307,"Also, I think maybe he could hand out this new propaganda, and deliver these conscriptions."
308,308,I don't suppose I could be conscripted?
309,309,Could I?
310,310,"Oh, yes, that's a wonderful idea."
311,311,"Yes, I give my full permission for you to send this tenyearold child into war."
312,312,Will someone get this kid a gun?
313,313,And I'd be more than happy to fight in the front.
314,314,"Get in line, kid."
315,315,"Okay. Here are the conscriptions, and here is a gun."
316,316,Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
317,317,It's a bit... for the gun?
318,318,No.
319,319,Yuck.
320,320,Look.
321,321,What did they do?
322,322,What they could.
323,323,Come on.
324,324,Heyhey! Jojo Rabbit!
325,325,"Oh, look at your face."
326,326,I am a soldier!
327,327,I'm going to war!
328,328,And you are a postman!
329,329,"Jojo Rabbit, Jojo Rabbit!"
330,330,Mama?
331,331,Field Marshal Jojo is home.
332,332,Mama?
333,333,Mama? I'm home.
334,334,Mama?
335,335,Mama?
336,336,Hi.
337,337,What do you want?
338,338,Are you a ghost?
339,339,Sure. A ghost.
340,340,"Don't make me run, kid."
341,341,I'm far too hungry and you know how much we love the taste of blood.
342,342,Lose something?
343,343,"I'm not a ghost, Johannes."
344,344,"I'm something worse, but I think you already know that, don't you?"
345,345,You know what I am.
346,346, No.
347,347, Yes.
348,348,Say it.
349,349,Say it!
350,350,A Jew.
351,351,Gesundheit.
352,352,You can't be here.
353,353,"Well, your mother invited me, so I suppose that makes me her guest."
354,354, It's not allowed.
355,355," What will you do, sweet Hitlerchen?"
356,356,Hmm?
357,357,Of course.
358,358,"Go on, then. Tell them."
359,359,But do you know what happens if you do?
360,360,I'll tell them you helped me.
361,361,"And your mother, too."
362,362,Then we'll all be kaputt.
363,363,"And if you tell her you know about me, just one word..."
364,364,"I'll do the world a great, big favor and cut your Nazi head off."
365,365,Got it?
366,366,Ja.
367,367,I think I'll hold onto this.
368,368,It's pretty.
369,369,Sheesh. That was intense.
370,370, What am I going to do?
371,371," Honestly, no idea."
372,372,"I mean, there could be more of them."
373,373,Hundreds of them living in your walls.
374,374,How did she get control like that?
375,375,She must've used her powers.
376,376,Mind control.
377,377,"Oh, typical."
378,378, Did you see how fast she moved?
379,379, Yes.
380,380,"Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens."
381,381, And now she's got your fancy knife.
382,382, My knife!
383,383,"Yeah. Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens, Jack the Ripper."
384,384,"You're definitely in a pickle, my friend."
385,385,"Ah, what to do, what to do?"
386,386, Oh. Got it!
387,387, Got it!
388,388, I will negotiate.
389,389, Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill.
390,390,Or negotiate. Hmm.
391,391,Excuse me?
392,392,Little girl?
393,393,Um... Jew girl in the wall?
394,394,Yoohoo. Jew?
395,395,"Okay, well, I'll just say what I have to say and that's this: I'm not scared of you and I think you should find somewhere else to live."
396,396,Okay?
397,397,Not okay.
398,398,Get the hell out of my room.
399,399,"She's pretty rude, you know?"
400,400,That's just my two Pfennige.
401,401, And now she's got two knives.
402,402, I know!
403,403, How are you going to chop up stuff?
404,404, I don't know!
405,405,"Oh, and she's still up there, too."
406,406,"That... that thing, that, that..."
407,407, Jew.
408,408," Yeah. Jew, yeah."
409,409, What are we gonna do about that Jew?
410,410, You think of something.
411,411,"Oh, now I'm the expert?"
412,412,Stop offering me damned cigarettes! I'm ten!
413,413,All right. Sorry.
414,414,I'm stressed out!
415,415,"Okay, let's talk like turkeys."
416,416,"You can't tell your mother or that Jew will cut off your Nazi head, but there's no reason this thing in the attic needs to ruin your life."
417,417,"In fact, you could use it to your advantage."
418,418,How?
419,419,"When someone tries to use mind powers on me, know what I do?"
420,420,Use mind powers back on them.
421,421,Remember last year when that onearm pirate von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up with a table bomb?
422,422,"Yeah, you survived."
423,423,Correctomundo.
424,424,"The only reason I survived, apart from having bombproof legs, is because I outwitted old von Stauffy."
425,425,"I let him think that I was dead, when in actual fact, I was absolutely fine."
426,426,"By pretending I was dead, I drew out all the traitors."
427,427,So what are you going to do?
428,428,Pretend I'm dead?
429,429,"Exactly. Wait, no."
430,430,"No, what I mean is this: make her feel safe and then she'll drop her guard and then you will be the one in control."
431,431, Reverse psychology.
432,432, Don't complicate things.
433,433,"Just use my backwards mind power trick, and everything will be fine."
434,434,Ooh! I gotta go.
435,435,We're having unicorn for dinner at my place tonight.
436,436,"Concentrate, Jojo."
437,437,"Remember, a Jew living in your wall is better than two Jews flying around with their bat wings climbing down chimneys and eating innocent Nazis."
438,438,And don't give her any more knives.
439,439,TschÃ¼ss.
440,440,"Darling cub, why are you up, huh?"
441,441,"Did you eat anything, hmm?"
442,442,"Sorry, I lost track of time."
443,443,I was taking a long walk and having a thing...
444,444,"What are we going to do with these laces, huh?"
445,445,My goodness.
446,446,"You'll learn how to tie them eventually, no?"
447,447, I heard her.
448,448, What?
449,449,Who?
450,450,Inge.
451,451,Her ghost.
452,452,Oh. That's so sad for you.
453,453,You've lost your mind.
454,454,"It's sadder for me, though, because I have to live with a crazy person."
455,455,I heard noises. Upstairs.
456,456,Ghosts? Honestly.
457,457,You know what I heard? Rats.
458,458,"Yes, we have them."
459,459,Can you believe that?
460,460,Dirty animals.
461,461,"I've been meaning to tell you to stay away from upstairs, until I've cleared them all, okay?"
462,462,I don't need you getting sick.
463,463,"Okay, Mama."
464,464,I'll watch out for those dirty rats.
465,465,Where are all the goddamn knives?
466,466,"Are you going to bed, too?"
467,467,Yes. Soon.
468,468,I have to tidy some things first.
469,469,What things?
470,470,Mama things.
471,471,"Boy, you have to trust me, okay?"
472,472,"I'm the boss here, ja?"
473,473,I guess.
474,474,Good boy.
475,475,"Yes, but with..."
476,476,with one eye. Like...
477,477,Almost.
478,478,Not quite.
479,479,Great. You got it.
480,480,Ja.
481,481,You have to be more quiet.
482,482,He heard noises up here.
483,483,"If I have to choose between you and my son, I..."
484,484,I won't know where to send you.
485,485,You hear me?
486,486,He can't know.
487,487,"If he knows, then they know."
488,488, You could reason with him.
489,489, You don't know him.
490,490,He's a fanatic.
491,491,It took him three weeks to get over the fact that his grandfather was not blond.
492,492,I know he's in there somewhere.
493,493,The little boy who loves to play and runs to you because he's scared of thunder.
494,494,Thinks you invented chocolate cake.
495,495,"In the end, that's all you have."
496,496,Hope...
497,497,that your only remaining child is not just another ghost.
498,498,Perhaps we're all ghosts now.
499,499,We just don't know it.
500,500,Perhaps.
501,501,You've lived more lifetimes than most.
502,502,I haven't lived at all.
503,503,You're being challenged.
504,504,"They say you can't live, that you won't live."
505,505,"If that comes true, then they win."
506,506,They've been winning so far.
507,507,They'll never win.
508,508,That's the power you have.
509,509,"As long as there's someone alive, somewhere, then they lose."
510,510,They didn't get you yesterday or today.
511,511,You make tomorrow the same.
512,512,Hey.
513,513,Tomorrow must be the same.
514,514,Jesus Christ!
515,515,You must stretch.
516,516,Does that hurt you?
517,517, Yes.
518,518, Good. Pain is your friend.
519,519,Soon your leg will only be a little bit deformed and pointless.
520,520,I'm going to recommend another month off school though because your face might scare the other kids.
521,521,It's kind of ugly.
522,522,"Okay, who's next?"
523,523,Jojo.
524,524,"Baby, I have to go."
525,525,I'll see you at home. Mmm.
526,526," Hi, Captain K."
527,527, Hey.
528,528,If it isn't Herr Hand Grenade himself.
529,529,Ah.
530,530,"How's the leg, kid?"
531,531,It's pretty much healed.
532,532,It only 80% hurts now.
533,533,What are you guys doing?
534,534,I'm being made to teach the HJ boys water warfare training.
535,535,"You know, in case they ever need to go to battle in a swimming pool."
536,536,Can I ask you a question about Jews?
537,537,"Oh, God. Why?"
538,538,What should I do if I see one?
539,539,Ugh. Okay.
540,540,"If you see a Jew, you tell us, we tell the Gestapo, and they tell the SS, and then they go and they kill the Jew."
541,541,And anyone who helped the Jew.
542,542,"And because these are very paranoid times, probably some other people just in case."
543,543,It's a pretty drawn out process.
544,544,Even if the Jew hypnotized someone to make them hide the Jew in the first place?
545,545,I'd be amazed if that could happen.
546,546,"No, it can happen."
547,547,It happened to my uncle.
548,548,A Jew hypnotized him and he became a massive drunk and a gambler.
549,549,And he cheated on his wife and he had an inappropriate relationship with my sister.
550,550,"And then he drowned in an unrelated accident, but it was the Jew's fault."
551,551,Anyway. Did you see one?
552,552,A Jew.
553,553, I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.
554,554,"Yeah, me neither."
555,555,"Without their funny hats, it's damn near impossible."
556,556,Someone should write a book on the subject.
557,557,It would make things so much easier.
558,558, It would be a hit.
559,559, Ja.
560,560,"Finkie, they're drowning."
561,561,Come on.
562,562,"I'll see you later, little man."
563,563,"Okay, here's the situation."
564,564,"If I tell on you, you'll be in big trouble, and I don't think you want that."
565,565,"But then you'll tell on me and my mother, and we'll be in trouble, which I don't want."
566,566,"And if you tell my mother I know, then she'll kick you out, which you don't want."
567,567,"And if I tell my mother I know, then you'll cut off my Nazi head, which I also don't want."
568,568,"So, it's a Mexican stalemate."
569,569,It's just a normal stalemate.
570,570,I have some conditions for allowing you to stay here.
571,571," ""Conditions?""  Yes."
572,572,Tell me everything about the Jewish race.
573,573,Okay.
574,574,"We're like you, but human."
575,575,Please take this seriously.
576,576,Think of this as an exposÃ©.
577,577,I want to know all your secrets.
578,578,Kindly refrain from sitting on my sister's bed.
579,579,Why? She doesn't need it.
580,580,You know nothing of my sister.
581,581,Inge and I were friends.
582,582,I remember you.
583,583,Such a funny little boy.
584,584,Enough with the small talk.
585,585,Start telling me about your kind.
586,586,"Obviously, we are demons who love money."
587,587,Right?
588,588,Obviously.
589,589,Everyone knows that.
590,590,But what people don't know is that we're also allergic to food.
591,591,"Cheese, bread, meat."
592,592,That stuff will kill us instantly.
593,593,"So, if you're thinking of ending my life, that's the fastest way."
594,594,"Also biscuits, lethal."
595,595,Very funny.
596,596,"Anyway, there's not enough food for you, so I don't know what you're going to do."
597,597,Your mother managed to find me some bread.
598,598,She's kind.
599,599,She treats me like a person.
600,600,But you're not.
601,601,Not a proper person.
602,602,Are you?
603,603,"How dare you, Jew!"
604,604,You are weak like an eyelash.
605,605,I am born of Aryan ancestry.
606,606,My blood is the color of a pure red rose.
607,607,And my eyes are blue like...
608,608,Break free.
609,609,"Break free, great Aryan."
610,610,There are no weak Jews.
611,611,I am descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants.
612,612,We were chosen by God.
613,613,You were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full mustache.
614,614,"The stronger race, huh?"
615,615,"So, how's it all going with that Jew thing upstairs?"
616,616,"Well, she doesn't want to talk to me."
617,617,"Mmhmm. Well, you are a Nazi."
618,618,I guess.
619,619,This book is going to be harder to write than I thought.
620,620,Hmm.
621,621, What's she doing?
622,622, She's burning something.
623,623,What is she burning?
624,624,What are you burning?
625,625,She can't hear you.
626,626,What are you burning?
627,627,Why so happy?
628,628,Things are changing.
629,629,The Allies have taken Italy.
630,630,France will be next and soon the war will be over.
631,631,Goddamn it!
632,632,Why does that make you happy?
633,633,You hate your country that much?
634,634,I love my country.
635,635,It's the war I hate.
636,636,"It's pointless and stupid, and the sooner we have peace, the better."
637,637,"Oh, the war will end."
638,638,We will crush our enemies into dust.
639,639,"And when they are destroyed, we shall use their graves as toilets."
640,640,Okay. No more politics.
641,641,Dinner is neutral ground.
642,642,This table is Switzerland.
643,643,Let's eat.
644,644,You aren't eating.
645,645,No. I am not that hungry.
646,646,I might eat later.
647,647,"For now, I am just going to chew on these grapes."
648,648,"Well, I'm especially hungry tonight."
649,649,So maybe I'll just finish yours.
650,650,Don't want it to go to waste.
651,651,"How was your day, Johannes?"
652,652,"Oh, you know, just wandered around, being a deformed kid with nothing to live for."
653,653,You're not deformed.
654,654,"My face looks like a goddamn street map, woman."
655,655,I wouldn't expect you to understand.
656,656,"If my father were here, he'd get it."
657,657,"Well, he's not."
658,658,"I know. And instead, I'm stuck with you."
659,659,"You want your dad, 'eh?"
660,660,"Yeah, I do."
661,661, Yeah? Yeah?
662,662, Yeah. Yeah.
663,663, Yeah?
664,664, Yeah!
665,665,Fine.
666,666,Don't you ever talk to your goddamn mother like that!
667,667,"Paul, what happened?"
668,668,Paul?
669,669,I yelled at the kid.
670,670,What? Go apologize.
671,671,"Sorry, kid."
672,672,What?
673,673,What kind of apology was that?
674,674,"Sorry, kid."
675,675,Jojo...
676,676,"I know you miss me, but I'm..."
677,677,I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world.
678,678,"And while I'm gone, I need you to take care of my Rosie."
679,679,Can you do that?
680,680,"Yes, Dad."
681,681,Thanks.
682,682,She's doing what she can.
683,683,"Oh, gosh."
684,684,"We made a good kid, huh?"
685,685,"Mmmm! Damn, that's good."
686,686,It reminds me of dancing with Rosie in The Red Salon.
687,687,"You remember, honey?"
688,688,"Of course I do, babe."
689,689,"Hey, don't just sit there, kid."
690,690,Come.
691,691,"Dance with your parents, come."
692,692,"So, I'd like you to draw a picture of where Jews live."
693,693,"Where you all eat, sleep, and where the queen Jew lays the eggs."
694,694,You really are an idiot.
695,695,Come on. We have a lot of work to do.
696,696,Tell me about your family.
697,697,"I'll tell you about the Jews, but you are not privileged to know about my family."
698,698,But I need background.
699,699,Why are you hanging around with me?
700,700,Don't you have any friends?
701,701,Of course. Yorki.
702,702," ""Yorki?""  Amongst others."
703,703,"Well, you don't have anyone."
704,704,I have Nathan.
705,705,"""Nathan?"" Who the hell is that?"
706,706, My fiancÃ©. I have him.
707,707, Where is he?
708,708,"Fighting in the resistance, see."
709,709,He proposed to me on the banks of the FluÃ.
710,710,"He knelt down like a proper gentleman, recited a poem by Rilke."
711,711,"And when I said yes, we danced into the night."
712,712,Snore.
713,713,Who's Rilke?
714,714,A great poet.
715,715,Nathan's favorite.
716,716,"Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay."
717,717,"He's coming to rescue me, then we'll go live in Paris."
718,718,You'd turn your back on Germany forever?
719,719,It turned on me first.
720,720,"Well, we don't need you."
721,721,"You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up and go live in damn cheese, snail, baguette land."
722,722,"Now, now, just because you don't have a girlfriend."
723,723,I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.
724,724,"One day, you'll make time."
725,725,You'll think of nothing else.
726,726,You'll meet someone and spend your days dreaming of the moment you can hold them in your arms again.
727,727,That's love.
728,728, Ridiculous.
729,729, Finished.
730,730,I said to draw where Jews live.
731,731,This is just a stupid picture of my head.
732,732,Yeah. That's where we live.
733,733,"Rilke, Rilke, Rilke."
734,734,Where are you?
735,735,Poetrywriting dumbhead.
736,736,Ah.
737,737,"Yes. Great thinking, Rabbit."
738,738,We'll use all of these books to make a fake floor that she'll fall through.
739,739,Straight into a pit full of piranhas and... and lava and bacon.
740,740," Why, she won't know what hit her."
741,741, Shh!
742,742, Shh?
743,743, Shh!
744,744,You shush. Shush me?
745,745,Let's get a book and let's go.
746,746,Libraries are dumb.
747,747,"Yeah, this is a really good idea, what we're doing right now."
748,748,"If she had a heart, this would break it clean in two."
749,749,I have something to tell you.
750,750,"I came across an old letter from Nathan, your fiancÃ©, addressed to you."
751,751, What the hell are you talking about?
752,752, I'll just read it.
753,753,"""Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say, ""but I don't want to marry you anymore."
754,754,"""I found a new woman and we laugh a lot ""and do the tonguekiss."
755,755,"""It's like my favorite poet, Rilke, says, ""'We need in love to practice only this: letting each other go.' ""So, goodbye and sorry about letting you go."
756,756,"""From Nathan, your exfiancÃ©."
757,757,"""PS, I'm not really in the resistance."
758,758,"""I was lying."
759,759,"I'm unemployed and quite fat now."" Um... don't open the door, but I actually forgot there was a second letter."
760,760,"""Dear Elsa..."
761,761,"""I just wanted to let you know that I don't want to break up with you now."
762,762,"""I changed my mind because I don't want you to kill yourself over me, ""which a couple of girls have done in the past, ""and it's pretty stressful."
763,763,"""I need you to stay alive."
764,764,"""Thank God you're being taken care of by that kid ""who I must say is a remarkable young man beyond his years."
765,765,"""And brave, too."
766,766,"""And let's still get married sometime, ""even though I am truly unemployed ""and have nothing going on for me."
767,767,"Yours, Nathan.""  Beethoven."
768,768, Einstein.
769,769, Bach.
770,770, Gershwin.
771,771,Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.
772,772,"Musicians, is that all you have?"
773,773,Rilke.
774,774,"Oh, yeah, of course."
775,775,"Your favorite, Rilke."
776,776,Jewish mother.
777,777,"Dietrich, then."
778,778,Houdini.
779,779, No. That's impossible.
780,780," Believe it, brother."
781,781,"Just ask Pissarro, Modigliani, Man Ray, Gertrude Stein, Mr. Moses and the king of them all, Jesus Christi. Amen."
782,782,"Pew, pew, pew!"
783,783,"Well, you're just saying any old name now."
784,784,I've never heard of these people and now I'm fed up.
785,785,Hey.
786,786,"If you find any more of those letters, will you let me know?"
787,787,Sure.
788,788,Okay.
789,789,Bye.
790,790,"Ah, these banks used to be full of lovers."
791,791,There was dancing and singing.
792,792,Romance.
793,793,There's no time for romance.
794,794,We're at war.
795,795,Oh. There's always time for romance.
796,796,Someday you'll meet someone special.
797,797,Why does everyone keep telling me that?
798,798,Who else tells you that?
799,799,Everyone.
800,800,Anyway.
801,801,It's a stupid idea.
802,802,You're stupid.
803,803,Love is the strongest thing in the world.
804,804,I think you'll find that metal is the strongest thing in the world.
805,805,"Followed closely by dynamite, and then muscles."
806,806,"Besides, I wouldn't even know it if I saw it."
807,807,"Surprise, surprise."
808,808,Your shoelaces are undone again.
809,809,"Oh, Jojo."
810,810,You'll know when it happens.
811,811,You'll feel it.
812,812,It's a pain.
813,813," In my arse, I bet."
814,814, In your tummy.
815,815,"Like, like, you're full of butterflies."
816,816, Yuck.
817,817," Yeah, ""yuck."" Come on, Shitler."
818,818,Let's get a move on.
819,819,Whoa!
820,820, Hey!
821,821, What's wrong with you?
822,822,"I'm worried about you, man."
823,823,Are you drunk? Again?
824,824,"Come on. Oh, God."
825,825,Could you please untie them?
826,826, You're really getting fat.
827,827, I'm not...
828,828,"You know what? Why don't I just leave you here, okay?"
829,829, No.
830,830, I'll come and get you tomorrow.
831,831, Okay? How about that?
832,832," No. Mama, Mama!"
833,833,"You'll figure it out, darling."
834,834, No!
835,835, I'll meet you back at the house.
836,836, I'll see you tomorrow morning.
837,837," Mama, Mama!"
838,838,You're growing up too fast.
839,839,Tenyearolds shouldn't be celebrating war and talking politics.
840,840,You should be climbing trees and then falling out of those trees.
841,841,"But the FÃ¼hrer says when we win it is us, young boys who will rule the world."
842,842,Pfft!
843,843,The Reich is dying.
844,844,"We're going to lose the war and then what are you going to do, hmm?"
845,845,Life is a gift.
846,846,We must celebrate it.
847,847,We have to dance to show God we are grateful to be alive.
848,848,"Well, I won't dance."
849,849,Dancing is for people who don't have a job.
850,850,Dancing is for people who are free.
851,851,It's an escape from all this.
852,852,"Well, you're free to dance your way home."
853,853,I'll ride.
854,854,"Oh, no, you don't."
855,855,No one can stop me.
856,856,"Welcome home, boys!"
857,857,"Now, go home and kiss your mothers!"
858,858,"No news from Nathan today, I'm afraid."
859,859,"He's probably doing something amazing, like reading a book or growing a beard."
860,860,What's wrong?
861,861,You want me to tell you about the Jews?
862,862,Don't care.
863,863,"In the beginning, we used to live in caves."
864,864," Deep, deep in the center of the Earth."
865,865, Wait.
866,866,Scary places full of strange and wonderful creatures all with one thing in common.
867,867,Mmhmm. Stealing the ends of penises?
868,868,"No, you idiot."
869,869, The love of art.
870,870, No cutting penises off?
871,871,Do you want the story or not?
872,872,"You may continue, but I know it's true."
873,873,The penis thing.
874,874,Rabbis use them for earplugs.
875,875,And moving on.
876,876,"After many years of developing magic and spells, we slowly moved out of the caves and into the towns."
877,877,"Some of us stayed in the caves, though, in animal bodies."
878,878,Which are blobs or something?
879,879,"Well, I'll draw them for you."
880,880,There.
881,881,It'd be better with color.
882,882,Where's the horns?
883,883,Under the hair.
884,884,Where's yours?
885,885,I'm too young.
886,886, They grow when you turn 21.
887,887, Oh.
888,888,"These days we live among normal people, but often we take over a house and hang from the ceiling when we sleep."
889,889,Like bats.
890,890,"Oh, and another thing is we can read each other's minds."
891,891,"Oh, my God."
892,892,Everyone's minds?
893,893, What about German minds?
894,894, No.
895,895,Their heads are too thick for us to penetrate.
896,896,"Like birds, our true language sounds like singing."
897,897,And we're also attracted to shiny things.
898,898,"Crystals, glass and gold."
899,899,"""Attracted to shiny things."" But also ugly things."
900,900,Jews love ugliness.
901,901,That's another thing we learned at school.
902,902,"You love them, yes?"
903,903,Ugly things.
904,904,Hi.
905,905,You two seem to be getting on well.
906,906,I was just making sure she was still alive.
907,907, What do you care?
908,908, I don't.
909,909,I just don't want a dead person in my house.
910,910, How would you like it?
911,911, I'd love it.
912,912,"More dead people in my house, please."
913,913,"Look, just all the time you two are spending together, it's making me feel very uncomfortable."
914,914,You suggested it in the first place.
915,915,Did I?
916,916, Yeah.
917,917," Oh, yeah, I did."
918,918,"Besides, it's for the book."
919,919,"Oh, God, you're right."
920,920,I'm sorry.
921,921,Did I make it weird?
922,922,"It's weird now, isn't it?"
923,923,It shouldn't be weird between us.
924,924,None of this should be weird.
925,925,It's fine. I'm just tired.
926,926,I'm going to bed.
927,927,"Ja, I was just keeping your bed warm for you."
928,928,'Cause that's what real friends do.
929,929,"Hey, what do think about this uniform?"
930,930,I'm not sure about the hips on the pants.
931,931,Should they be bigger?
932,932, You look great.
933,933, Thank you.
934,934,"Now, listen, Jojo."
935,935,Can I give you some really good advice?
936,936,"When you see what's in her mind and where she's trying to make you go in your mind, in your mind, you must go the other way."
937,937,Get what I'm saying?
938,938,Do not let her put you in a brain prison.
939,939,"That, dear Jojo, is one thing that cannot and must not ever, ever happen to a German!"
940,940,Do not let your German brain be bossed around!
941,941,"I won't let her boss my German brain around, mein FÃ¼hrer."
942,942,Try not to.
943,943,"Now, I think you've got a lot of good information in your book."
944,944,"It's time to show it to the world, don't you think?"
945,945,Ja.
946,946, Adolf?
947,947, Hmm?
948,948,Do you think I'm ugly?
949,949,Yes.
950,950,Is he asleep?
951,951,Mmm.
952,952,He's different.
953,953,He suspects something.
954,954,He thinks Inge's ghost lives up here.
955,955,You remind me of her.
956,956,You really do.
957,957,I would love to have seen her grow into a woman.
958,958,But I'll have to watch you instead.
959,959,I don't know anything about being a woman.
960,960,Is that what it is?
961,961,You do things like drink wine?
962,962,Sure. You drink.
963,963,"Champagne, if you're happy."
964,964,"Champagne, if you're sad."
965,965,You drive a car.
966,966,Gamble if you want.
967,967,Own diamonds.
968,968,Learn how to fire a gun.
969,969,You travel to Morocco.
970,970,Take up lovers.
971,971,Make them suffer.
972,972,You look a tiger in the eye.
973,973,And trust without fear.
974,974,That's what it is to be a woman.
975,975,How do you do that?
976,976,How do you know you can trust someone?
977,977,You trust them.
978,978,Good night.
979,979,All those other things.
980,980,Did you do that stuff?
981,981,"You know, go to Morocco and the rest?"
982,982,No.
983,983,I never looked a tiger in the eye.
984,984,"Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs for when the city is attacked, not actual German shepherds."
985,985,Get them out of here.
986,986,Get them out of here!
987,987, Now! Now! Now!
988,988," Move along, please."
989,989,"Move along, please."
990,990,"Thank you, thank you."
991,991, I'm sorry for yelling at you.
992,992, I feel so stupid.
993,993,"No, no."
994,994,It's a silly name for a dog.
995,995,I should've been more clear.
996,996, You're doing a great job.
997,997, Danke.
998,998,"Hiya, kid."
999,999,"How can we help you today, Master Betzler?"
1000,1000,What's up? Walk with me.
1001,1001,"If someone turned in a Jew, would they get a medal or something?"
1002,1002,"Jews, Jews, Jews."
1003,1003,You're still going on about those people?
1004,1004,"You know I'm preparing the city for imminent invasion, right?"
1005,1005,I'm trying to plan a defense strategy.
1006,1006,"I've got Americans to the west, got Russians to the east."
1007,1007,My friend once met some Russians and they ate him.
1008,1008,Who's the walnuts?
1009,1009,"Walnuts are just walnuts, kid."
1010,1010,What do you want to talk about?
1011,1011,"Well, I am learning a lot about Jews."
1012,1012,Did you know Jews can read each other's minds?
1013,1013,"And when they sleep, they hang from the ceiling, like bats."
1014,1014,That's fascinating.
1015,1015,And where did you come by this information?
1016,1016,Research.
1017,1017,I'm writing a book.
1018,1018,"Oh, congratulations."
1019,1019,What's it called?
1020,1020,Yoohoo Jew.
1021,1021,It's an exposÃ© on Jews.
1022,1022,"You could also call it Who Are You, Jew?"
1023,1023,Or what about Jews News?
1024,1024,"Oh, you do have a wonderful imagination on you."
1025,1025, But it's real.
1026,1026," Ja, of course it's real."
1027,1027,"When I was your age, I had an imaginary friend called Conny."
1028,1028,He used to wet my bed when I was asleep.
1029,1029,He got me in so much trouble.
1030,1030,"Hey, come here."
1031,1031,You might like to check out what I'm working on.
1032,1032,"As part of our preparations for the invasion, I'm redesigning my uniform."
1033,1033,"Note, the feathers for aerodynamics, the sparkly color to dazzle the enemy, the boots purely decorative."
1034,1034,"And this, this is a Gatling gun mounted with a radio which emits annoying music to dishearten the enemy."
1035,1035,"This is all copyrighted, by the way."
1036,1036,That means you can't copy it.
1037,1037,"Ja. Don't get any ideas, kid."
1038,1038,The kids tell me that your father's away fighting.
1039,1039,So it appears you are now the man of the house.
1040,1040,How's that going?
1041,1041,It's okay.
1042,1042,Ja?
1043,1043,"So, what jobs do you have for me today?"
1044,1044,"Well, I've got one, I won't lie."
1045,1045,"It's a bit of a step down from what you're used to, but we need all hands on deck right now."
1046,1046,Metal for Hitler!
1047,1047,Pots and pans for the war effort!
1048,1048,âª Here comes the metal man âª âª Looking for your pots and pans âª  Metal for Hitler!
1049,1049, Metal for Hitler!
1050,1050,Nuts and bolts!
1051,1051,Pots and pans!
1052,1052,"""Free Germany."" Jojo?"
1053,1053, Yorki?
1054,1054, Hi!
1055,1055,You're a soldier now?
1056,1056,At your service.
1057,1057,But you're only 11.
1058,1058,I know.
1059,1059, May I?
1060,1060," Yeah, sure."
1061,1061,Is that paper?
1062,1062,"That's what I thought at first, too, but it's ""paperlike."" It's the latest material invented by our top scientists."
1063,1063,"Well, I'm impressed."
1064,1064,"Hey, Yorki."
1065,1065,I caught a Jew. A real one.
1066,1066,"Oh, a Jew?"
1067,1067,I saw some that they caught hiding in the forest last month.
1068,1068,"Personally, I didn't see what all the fuss was about."
1069,1069,They weren't at all scary and seemed kind of normal.
1070,1070,"Oh, I'm getting distracted."
1071,1071,I got to go.
1072,1072,Bye.
1073,1073, Bye.
1074,1074," Oh, my God."
1075,1075,It's so hard to run in this thing.
1076,1076,I found these.
1077,1077,You can have them.
1078,1078,They're probably broken.
1079,1079,Doesn't mean anything.
1080,1080,Maybe you can draw something for my book.
1081,1081,I could draw you again.
1082,1082,No one wants to see pictures of cripples.
1083,1083,You're hardly a cripple.
1084,1084,"Besides, true artists don't see that stuff."
1085,1085,"Blind artists, you mean."
1086,1086,It's fine.
1087,1087,I'll just accept I'll be one of those guys who'll never get to kiss a girl.
1088,1088,"You will be kissed, Jojo."
1089,1089,Do you want me to kiss you?
1090,1090,Okay.
1091,1091,Two things.
1092,1092,"Thing number one: It's illegal for Nazis and Jews to hang out like we do, let alone kiss."
1093,1093,"Thing number two: It'd just be a sympathy kiss, which doesn't count."
1094,1094,You're not a Nazi.
1095,1095,"Uh, I'm massively into swastikas, so I think that's a pretty good sign right there."
1096,1096,"You're not a Nazi, Jojo."
1097,1097,You're a tenyearold kid who likes swastikas and likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.
1098,1098,But you are not one of them.
1099,1099,Okay.
1100,1100,Let's just agree to disagree.
1101,1101,All right?
1102,1102,"""Not a Nazi."" What a dirty Jew."
1103,1103,Come on. Hide.
1104,1104,Hurry. Go.
1105,1105,Heil Hitler.
1106,1106,Allow me to introduce myself.
1107,1107,I'm Captain Herman Deertz of the Falkenheim Gestapo.
1108,1108,"With me, Herr Mueller, Herr Junker, Herr Klum and Herr Frosch."
1109,1109,May we come in?
1110,1110,Thank you so much.
1111,1111, Heil Hitler.
1112,1112, Heil Hitler.
1113,1113, Heil Hitler.
1114,1114, Heil Hitler.
1115,1115, Heil Hitler.
1116,1116, Heil Hitler.
1117,1117, Heil Hitler.
1118,1118, Heil Hitler.
1119,1119, Heil Hitler.
1120,1120, Heil Hitler.
1121,1121,"Hey, Jojo!"
1122,1122,"Hey, guys!"
1123,1123,Good to see you!
1124,1124,"My bicycle got a flat tire, so I carried it."
1125,1125, Captain Klenzendorf.
1126,1126,Heil Hitler.
1127,1127, Heil Hitler.
1128,1128, Heil Hitler.
1129,1129, Heil Hitler.
1130,1130, Heil Hitler.
1131,1131, Heil Hitler.
1132,1132, Heil Hitler.
1133,1133, Heil Hitler.
1134,1134, Heil Hitler.
1135,1135, Heil Hitler.
1136,1136,You know Freddy Finkel.
1137,1137, Heil Hitler.
1138,1138, Heil Hitler.
1139,1139, Heil Hitler.
1140,1140, Heil Hitler.
1141,1141, Heil Hitler.
1142,1142, Heil Hitler.
1143,1143, Heil Hitler.
1144,1144, Heil Hitler.
1145,1145, Heil Hitler.
1146,1146, Heil Hitler.
1147,1147,"So, did I miss anything?"
1148,1148,"No, no. We were just "" Heil Hitlering"" the boy and then "" Heil Hitlering"" yourself and then, of course, "" Heil Hitlering"" Freddy Finkel and now we are in the midst of a routine inspection."
1149,1149,"And, uh, what brings you here, Captain?"
1150,1150,"Oh, we were just passing by and we thought we'd drop off some pamphlets for the boy."
1151,1151,He works for us.
1152,1152, I see.
1153,1153, Ja.
1154,1154, And yourself?
1155,1155," Oh, you know how it is."
1156,1156,Every day we take a call.
1157,1157,"""Hello, is that the Gestapo?"
1158,1158,"I believe there's a Communist hiding behind my fridge."" We go around to investigate."
1159,1159,It's just some mold.
1160,1160,"So, not far off."
1161,1161,It's all part of the job.
1162,1162,Oh!
1163,1163,Now this is my kind of little boy's bedroom.
1164,1164,"Oh, yes."
1165,1165,There he is.
1166,1166,You and your friends may have heard a rumor that Hitler only has one ball.
1167,1167,This is nonsense.
1168,1168,He has four.
1169,1169,"So, you are volunteering at the Hitlerjugend office, yes?"
1170,1170,Yes.
1171,1171,"Oh, good for you."
1172,1172,I wish more of our young boys had your blind fanaticism.
1173,1173,What on Earth are those oafs up to?
1174,1174,"Why don't we go upstairs and see, yes?"
1175,1175,Do you know where your mother is?
1176,1176,No. I think she's in town.
1177,1177,Has she been spending much time at home?
1178,1178,She is quite busy.
1179,1179,Is she?
1180,1180,"Well, I'm pleased to see that you're wearing your..."
1181,1181,"jugend uniform, but..."
1182,1182,where is your knife?
1183,1183,You must always carry your DJ knife. Where is it?
1184,1184, I left it...
1185,1185, It's here.
1186,1186,And who might you be?
1187,1187,"Well, who might you be?"
1188,1188,And what are you doing in my house?
1189,1189,You live here too?
1190,1190,"I'm his sister, Inge."
1191,1191,Heil Hitler.
1192,1192,Heil Hitler.
1193,1193, Heil Hitler.
1194,1194, Heil Hitler.
1195,1195, Heil Hitler.
1196,1196, Heil Hitler.
1197,1197, Heil Hitler.
1198,1198, Heil Hitler.
1199,1199, Heil Hitler.
1200,1200, Heil Hitler.
1201,1201, Heil Hitler.
1202,1202, Heil Hitler.
1203,1203, Heil Hitler.
1204,1204, Heil Hitler.
1205,1205, Heil Hitler.
1206,1206, Heil Hitler.
1207,1207,"I did not know you had a sister, Johannes."
1208,1208,Sometimes he'd prefer if I was dead.
1209,1209,"Isn't that right, little Frankenstein?"
1210,1210,"Now, now."
1211,1211,There is no need to attack his hideous physical deformity.
1212,1212,That is a war wound.
1213,1213,"But, uh, why do you have his knife?"
1214,1214,I'm guarding my room because he refuses to stay out of it.
1215,1215,"Well, what do you have hidden in there?"
1216,1216,"Oh, you know, girl stuff."
1217,1217,May I?
1218,1218,Naturally.
1219,1219,"You see, we deal with an inordinate number of reports, denunciations and general investigations."
1220,1220,"And, of course, we are indeed interested in problems of crime and antiparty sentiment, but we still have one greater concern, that of the ""Goldilockses."" Sneaking around, eating other people's food, sleeping in their beds."
1221,1221,It really is quite rude.
1222,1222,"I don't suppose I could see your papers, could I?"
1223,1223,"Papers, Miss Betzler."
1224,1224,"Quickly, please."
1225,1225,We don't have all day.
1226,1226,"Yes, of course."
1227,1227,How old are you in this photo?
1228,1228,They're three years old.
1229,1229,I was 14.
1230,1230,Date of birth?
1231,1231,First of May.
1232,1232,Correct.
1233,1233,"Thank you, Inge."
1234,1234,Get a new photo. You look like a ghost in this one.
1235,1235,Wait.
1236,1236,What is...
1237,1237,this?
1238,1238,Yoohoo Jew.
1239,1239,"Tell me, who did this?"
1240,1240,I did.
1241,1241,It's an exposÃ© on Jews.
1242,1242,"How they think, behave, look."
1243,1243,It'll be a gift to the FÃ¼hrer.
1244,1244,"Guys, you have to see this."
1245,1245,"Oh, look at this one."
1246,1246,He has a tail.
1247,1247,There's one of them hanging upside down like a bat.
1248,1248,"This one here, it is a drawing of their heads."
1249,1249,And who is operating the machinery of their brains?
1250,1250,The devil.
1251,1251,"Ah, it's funny 'cause it's true."
1252,1252,"Oh, look at this little, stupid Jew."
1253,1253,There they are with horns.
1254,1254,What is this?
1255,1255,"""Die, Nathan, die."" ""Ways of killing Nathan."" Nathan being tortured by snakes."
1256,1256,Poked with sticks.
1257,1257,Being fired from a cannon and just being called names.
1258,1258,Yeah.
1259,1259,Nathan being crushed under the wheel of an oldtime pennyfarthing bicycle.
1260,1260,"Who is Nathan, please?"
1261,1261,Just some boy.
1262,1262,Nathan being roasted over an open fire.
1263,1263,"Reminds me, we must get back and..."
1264,1264, You remember? Cause we left that guy hanging up.
1265,1265, Ja. Ja.
1266,1266,Thank you for this.
1267,1267,You have really made my day.
1268,1268,I do hope you continue with it.
1269,1269,"And, of course, if you see anything suspicious, give us a ring."
1270,1270,Good day.
1271,1271,Heil Hitler.
1272,1272,Heil Hitler.
1273,1273,"Nice to meet you, Inge."
1274,1274,"Stay home, Jojo."
1275,1275,Look after your family.
1276,1276,Look after this knife.
1277,1277,"Elsa, you fooled them."
1278,1278,May seventh.
1279,1279,What?
1280,1280,"She was born on the seventh, not the first."
1281,1281,He was helping us.
1282,1282,They'll be back.
1283,1283,"They'll figure out she's dead, then I'll be dead."
1284,1284,Nobody really knows Inge died.
1285,1285,You could be her.
1286,1286,I'll tell Mama everything when she gets home.
1287,1287,That I know you and that we're friends.
1288,1288,Jew and Nazi are not friends.
1289,1289,"Man, that was a complete bust."
1290,1290,You mind explaining that?
1291,1291,She's not...
1292,1292,She doesn't seem like a bad person.
1293,1293,I am beginning to question your loyalty to myself and the party.
1294,1294,You call yourself a patriot?
1295,1295,"Yet, where is the evidence?"
1296,1296,The German soldier was born out of necessity.
1297,1297,Germany depends on the passion of these young men.
1298,1298,Passion and the readiness to fall for the Fatherland despite the futile efforts of Allied war profiteers who send their illprepared armies clumsily into the lair of the wolf.
1299,1299,And only zealous men who stand steadfast in the face of the enemy will be etched in German memory forever.
1300,1300,"And it is up to you to decide if you want to be remembered, or disappear without a trace like a pitiful grain of sand into a desert of insignificance."
1301,1301,To put it plainly...
1302,1302,get your shit together and sort out your priorities.
1303,1303,"You're ten, Jojo."
1304,1304,Start acting like it.
1305,1305,No.
1306,1306,Did you know?
1307,1307,She didn't tell me much...
1308,1308,only that she worked with her friends and your father was somehow involved from afar.
1309,1309,No. He's fighting in the war.
1310,1310,She said he'll be home as soon as the war's over.
1311,1311,She didn't want to tell you anything for obvious reasons.
1312,1312,Because she hated me.
1313,1313,'Cause I'm a Nazi.
1314,1314,I'm the enemy.
1315,1315,She didn't want you to know anything that could get you in trouble.
1316,1316,But now I have nothing.
1317,1317,No one.
1318,1318,The last time I saw my parents was at the station.
1319,1319,They were put on a train.
1320,1320,I ran.
1321,1321,Slowly found my way back to the city.
1322,1322,A friend of my father's hid me.
1323,1323,"Then another friend, then friends of friends."
1324,1324,Until your mother took me in.
1325,1325,"And so far, I'm still here."
1326,1326,But my...
1327,1327,my parents went to a place you don't come back from.
1328,1328,What's the first thing you'll do when you're free?
1329,1329,Dance.
1330,1330,"âª Everybody's gotta live âª âª And everybody's gonna die âª âª Everybody's gotta live âª âª I think you know the reason why âª âª Sometimes the goin' gets so good âª âª Then again, it gets pretty rough âª âª But when I have you in my arms, baby âª âª You know I just can't, I just can't get enough âª âª Oh, yeah âª âª Everybody's gotta live âª âª Yes, they do âª âª And everybody's gonna die âª âª Everybody try to have a, a good time âª âª I think you know the reason why âª âª I feel like I've seen just about a million sunsets âª âª She said if you're with me, I'll never go away âª âª That's when I stopped and I took another look at my baby âª âª She said if you're with me, I'll never go away âª âª Because âª âª Everybody's gotta live âª âª And everybody's gonna die âª âª Everybody's gotta live âª âª Before you know the reason why âª âª Yeah âª âª Everybody's gotta live âª That's it. That's it. Hurry."
1331,1331,Yorki?
1332,1332,Jojo!
1333,1333,"Oh, God."
1334,1334,Jojo.
1335,1335,How I've missed you.
1336,1336,Sorry about your mama.
1337,1337,I cried for ages when I heard what happened.
1338,1338,What's going on out here?
1339,1339,"The Russians, Jojo."
1340,1340,They're coming.
1341,1341,And the Americans from the other way.
1342,1342,And England and China and Africa and India.
1343,1343,The whole world is coming.
1344,1344,Help me with this ammo.
1345,1345, And how are we doing?
1346,1346, Terribly.
1347,1347,Our only friends are the Japanese.
1348,1348,"And just between you and me, they don't look very Aryan."
1349,1349, Remember that Jew I told you about?
1350,1350," Oh, yeah."
1351,1351,I still have her.
1352,1352,She's basically my girlfriend now.
1353,1353,"Oh, good for you, Jojo."
1354,1354,A girlfriend.
1355,1355,"But, you know, she's Jewish."
1356,1356,"There are bigger things to worry about than Jews, Jojo."
1357,1357,There's Russians somewhere out there.
1358,1358,They're worse than anyone.
1359,1359,I heard they eat babies and have sex with dogs.
1360,1360,"I mean, like, that's bad, right?"
1361,1361,Sex with dogs?
1362,1362,Yeah.
1363,1363,"The Englishmen do it, too."
1364,1364,We have to stop them before they eat us and screw all our dogs.
1365,1365,It's crazy.
1366,1366,"And now Hitler's gone, we're really on our own."
1367,1367, What?
1368,1368, You didn't hear?
1369,1369,He's dead.
1370,1370,He gave up and blew his brains out.
1371,1371,No.
1372,1372,That's impossible.
1373,1373,Blew them out.
1374,1374,His brains.
1375,1375,Turns out he was hiding a lot of stuff from us.
1376,1376,Doing some really bad things behind everyone's backs.
1377,1377,I'm not sure we chose the right side.
1378,1378,Okay. Come here. Okay.
1379,1379,See that American there?
1380,1380,Just go give him a hug.
1381,1381,Go! Run! Let's go!
1382,1382,"Oh, Yorki. Yorki, great news."
1383,1383,"You've just been promoted, and you get your own pistol."
1384,1384,Just go and shoot anybody who looks different to us.
1385,1385, Okay.
1386,1386, Okay.
1387,1387,"Jojo, where's your uniform?"
1388,1388,"Here. Here, put the jacket on so they know not to shoot you."
1389,1389,We must kill everything that we see.
1390,1390,For Hitler.
1391,1391,"Die, devil scum!"
1392,1392,Die!
1393,1393,Fall out!
1394,1394,Whoo! Ha!
1395,1395,Ja.
1396,1396,Come. This way.
1397,1397,They are here!
1398,1398,The Americans!
1399,1399,Come on.
1400,1400, Stay on him.
1401,1401," Behind you, Cap."
1402,1402,"Over here. Come on, go!"
1403,1403,I'll check him.
1404,1404,"Hey, boys! Whoohoo!"
1405,1405,Move the prisoners.
1406,1406,Keep the prisoners all in line.
1407,1407,Quickly. Quickly!
1408,1408,Hey! Hey!
1409,1409,What?
1410,1410,II don't understand.
1411,1411,Move! Move!
1412,1412,"Get up, wretched dog."
1413,1413,Captain K.
1414,1414,"Heya, kid."
1415,1415,"Look at all this commotion, huh?"
1416,1416, What's happening?
1417,1417," Hysteria, my friend."
1418,1418,We've come...
1419,1419,We've come to the end.
1420,1420, Party's over.
1421,1421," No, I'm not like them."
1422,1422, Are you scared?
1423,1423,Don't be scared.
1424,1424,No. Please.
1425,1425, Look at me.
1426,1426, No. No.
1427,1427,I'm sorry about Rosie.
1428,1428,She was a good person.
1429,1429,An actual good person.
1430,1430,Okay?
1431,1431,"Hey. It's okay, kid."
1432,1432,"Shh, shh, shh."
1433,1433,I've been meaning to tell you. I think your book is really great.
1434,1434,"Ja, I'm sorry for laughing at it."
1435,1435,Very creative.
1436,1436,"Come here, let's take a look at you."
1437,1437,You look good.
1438,1438,"You're okay, kid."
1439,1439,"Now, go home. Look after that sister of yours."
1440,1440,Okay?
1441,1441,"Get away. Get away, Jew."
1442,1442, Hey! What's going on?
1443,1443, Get away!
1444,1444, He's a Jew.
1445,1445,Shut up.
1446,1446,You know this Nazi?
1447,1447, He helped us.
1448,1448," No, I don't know this dirty Jew."
1449,1449,"No, no..."
1450,1450," Get away, Jew."
1451,1451, Hey. Hey!
1452,1452,"Shut your mouth, Nazi."
1453,1453, No! No! No!
1454,1454, Get out of here. Go home.
1455,1455, No! Leave him alone!
1456,1456, Go home!
1457,1457,No!
1458,1458, Get off!
1459,1459, Get out of here.
1460,1460,Go home!
1461,1461,Jojo?
1462,1462,Yorki!
1463,1463,Thank God.
1464,1464,I thought you were dead.
1465,1465,No. It seems like I can never die.
1466,1466,I'm gonna go home and see my mother.
1467,1467,I need a cuddle.
1468,1468, Nothing makes sense anymore.
1469,1469," Ja, I know."
1470,1470,It's definitely not a good time to be a Nazi.
1471,1471,"Hey. So now the war's over, at least your girlfriend will be free."
1472,1472,She can leave now.
1473,1473,Something wrong?
1474,1474,I've got to go.
1475,1475, Okay.
1476,1476, Sorry.
1477,1477,Later!
1478,1478,Hi. I'm home.
1479,1479,What's going on out there?
1480,1480, Out where?
1481,1481," Outside, dummy."
1482,1482,"Jojo, what's going on?"
1483,1483,Is it safe to come out?
1484,1484,"Jojo, is it safe?"
1485,1485,Can I leave?
1486,1486,No.
1487,1487,You can't leave.
1488,1488,Why?
1489,1489,You have to stay here...
1490,1490,Who won?
1491,1491,with me.
1492,1492,"Jojo, who won... who won the war?"
1493,1493,We did.
1494,1494,Germany won the war.
1495,1495,II'm sorry.
1496,1496,"""Dear Elsa."
1497,1497,"""I know it's hard for you at the moment..."
1498,1498,"""and I know you feel like giving up."
1499,1499,"""But you have to carry on."
1500,1500,"""Me and your good friend, Jojo, ""have devised a plan for you to escape."
1501,1501,"""So, please listen to him."
1502,1502,"""He's gonna help you get out of there."
1503,1503,"""And then you can come live with me in Paris."
1504,1504,"""And don't worry about Jojo."
1505,1505,"""He'll be okay."
1506,1506,"""See you in Paris."
1507,1507,"Nathan.""  He's dead."
1508,1508, Pardon?
1509,1509,Nathan.
1510,1510,He died last year.
1511,1511,Tuberculosis.
1512,1512,Well... that's weird.
1513,1513,Who wrote these?
1514,1514,"Thank you, Jojo."
1515,1515,You have been so good to me.
1516,1516,"Well, the thing is, I love you."
1517,1517,"I know you think of me as a younger brother, which is fine, and, um, you're too old anyway."
1518,1518,But...
1519,1519,"Man, it's quite hot in here."
1520,1520,"I love you, too."
1521,1521, As a younger brother.
1522,1522, As a younger brother.
1523,1523,"Look, me and fake Nathan have found a way for you to escape."
1524,1524,Maybe you can trust a younger brother?
1525,1525,Maybe.
1526,1526,"Okay, then."
1527,1527,Get your things together.
1528,1528,We're leaving.
1529,1529,Jojo Betzler.
1530,1530,Ten and a half years old.
1531,1531,"Today, just do what you can."
1532,1532,"Where in the shit do you think you're going, hmm?"
1533,1533, Out.
1534,1534," Out? Oh, no, you don't."
1535,1535,"No, we're gonna stay in here and you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on with you and that thing in the attic."
1536,1536,"That ""thing"" is a girl."
1537,1537," You're in love with her, aren't you?"
1538,1538, Yes.
1539,1539, Admit it.
1540,1540, I just said yes.
1541,1541,I knew it!
1542,1542,"Well, it's never gonna work out."
1543,1543,"No. No, she's too old for you."
1544,1544,And you're ugly.
1545,1545,You know she's gonna leave you.
1546,1546,"You know that, don't you?"
1547,1547,"So, here's what's gonna happen, you little shit."
1548,1548,"You're gonna put this on, okay?"
1549,1549,You're gonna forget about that disgusting Jewy cow up there.
1550,1550,"And you're gonna come back to me, where you belong."
1551,1551,Right?
1552,1552,Put it on.
1553,1553,"And then, we're gonna pretend none of this ever happened."
1554,1554,You got it?
1555,1555,You're not gonna heil me?
1556,1556,Come on? For old time's sake?
1557,1557," Heil me, little man."
1558,1558, No.
1559,1559, Heil me.
1560,1560, No.
1561,1561,Give me a little heil.
1562,1562,Just a little heil. Please?
1563,1563,"Fuck off, Hitler."
1564,1564,Come on.
1565,1565,Oh. Wait.
1566,1566,Ready?
1567,1567,Yeah.
1568,1568,Is it dangerous out there?
1569,1569,Extremely.
1570,1570,Yeah!
1571,1571,Whoo!
1572,1572,We made it.
1573,1573,Probably deserved that.
1574,1574,What do we do now?
