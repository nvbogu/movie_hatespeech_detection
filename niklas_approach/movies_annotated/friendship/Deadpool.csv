1194,1194,But there is a slight chance Vanisher could make it.
1195,1195,"PEOPLE EXCLAIMING Nope, no chance. He's dead."
1196,1196,DOMINO: The whole team?
1197,1197,Only the main ones.
1198,1198,We're still good.
1199,1199,"Fuck, you are dumb."
1200,1200,Whoever planned this stunt's been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.
1201,1201,I'll tell you that much.
1202,1202,That's pretty obvious!
1203,1203,"Looking good, Vanisher."
1204,1204,They're headed into the tunnel.
1205,1205,"I'm that kid's only hope, so sit tight and wait for my word."
1206,1206,DOMINO: Whatever.
1207,1207,We're gonna lose 'em.
1208,1208,I'm dropping in.
1209,1209,"DEADPOOL: Uh, that's a negative, sole survivor."
1210,1210,Luck is not a superpower!
1211,1211,We are so fucked!

1213,1213,"CARS HORNS HONKING BRAKES SCREECHING DEADPOOL: Seriously, I don't get it!"
1214,1214,"What, you shoot luck lasers out of your eyes?"
1215,1215,It's just it's hard to picture.
1216,1216,And certainly not very cinematic.
1217,1217,"I mean, luck?"
1218,1218,"What coked out, glass pipesucking freakshow comic book artist..."
1219,1219,came up with that little chestnut?
1220,1220,Probably a guy who can't draw feet!
1221,1221,"Once again, it all falls on my shoulders."
1222,1222,It's why I'm cursed to be a solo act.
1223,1223,Wander the Earth... I'm in.
1224,1224,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
1225,1225,I'm in.
1226,1226,How in the fuck are you in already?
1227,1227,"Oh, shit."
1228,1228,It's Cable. 12 o'clock.
1229,1229,DEADPOOL: Okay.
1230,1230,New plan. Use all of your imaginary powers to stop Cable from killing that kid.

1237,1237,DEADPOOL: He's on top of you.
1238,1238,He's tearing you open!
1239,1239,He's going in through the back!
1240,1240,"Oh, God, he's inside!"

1309,1309,To get my revenge.
1310,1310,I'm going to burn that headmaster alive.

1334,1334,BLIND AL: No child is hopeless.
1335,1335,Don't give up on the boy.
1336,1336,How could he just walk away?
1337,1337,It was the coldness in his eyes.
1338,1338,You should've heard it.
1339,1339,WADE SIGHS I guess family really is an Fword.
1340,1340,"GROANS Rub my legs, Mama."
1341,1341,Why would I rub your legs?
1342,1342,"Please, they hurt."

1344,1344,BLIND AL SIGHS What in the...
1345,1345,Why is your hand so tiny again?
1346,1346,That's not my hand.
1347,1347,"Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph!"
1348,1348,That was nice for me. DOOR OPENS Wade! I heard what happened with the convoy and...

1350,1350,A warrior has nothing to be ashamed of.
1351,1351,"WEASEL: Yeah, but you do."
1352,1352,Look at you.
1353,1353,"You're just straight shirtcocking it, toddlerstyle."
1354,1354,"Oh, yeah."
1355,1355,Full Winnie the Pooh.
1356,1356,The hell's happening?
1357,1357,Describe it.
1358,1358,"I wouldn't ask him to do that, if I were you."
1359,1359,"WEASEL: It's like, um... Here we go."
1360,1360,"It's like he was giving birth anally, but they quit halfway through."
1361,1361,"They got the legs out, and they said, ""You know what, I'm done."" Happy?"
1362,1362,It's like he's a Muppet from the waist down.
1363,1363,"But this time, you can see the Muppet's dick. DOOR OPENS Grover's got a cock the size of a twig."
1364,1364,"DOPINDER: Mr. Weasel, I can no longer be doubleparked."

1370,1370,Oh. Wow!
1371,1371,Cool your pits.
1372,1372,They're growing back.
1373,1373,I'm talking about your face.
1374,1374,I've never seen you without your mask before.
1375,1375,Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.
1376,1376,"DOMINO: Your legs, though, they're cute."
1377,1377,You wanna borrow a pair of pants?
1378,1378,I'm glad everybody dropped by.
1379,1379,You must be wondering why I didn't call you here.
1380,1380,I'll tell you why I'm here.
1381,1381,"""The Time Traveler's Wife's"" husband..."
1382,1382,beat me within an inch of my life.
1383,1383,He was torturing me!
1384,1384,But all I told him was everything he wanted to know.
1385,1385,"So, I'm here to help us gear up."
1386,1386,So we can go after him without me.
1387,1387,WADE: No!
1388,1388,I'm doing this alone.
1389,1389,The Juggernaut will kill you all. Fair enough.
1390,1390,WADE: I just need a couple of hours to get some legs under me. What will you do?
1391,1391,WADE: I don't care what the kid did to me.
1392,1392,"I ain't letting Cable get to him, even if I have to teabag him to death."
1393,1393,It's really just a sip of tea at this point.
1394,1394,"Zip it, black Black Widow!"
1395,1395,I'm flowing.
1396,1396,The first order of business is to get me in front of Cable...
1397,1397,so I can pull all the fucking blood out of his body...
1398,1398,and fashion his bones into holiday jewelry.
1399,1399,"Then, I'm gonna take his skin..."
1400,1400,and stretch it out over a homemade mating drum.
1401,1401,"He's standing right behind you, isn't he?"
1402,1402,COCKS GUN What in the ass?
1403,1403,Is this apartment listed on Tinder? Grindr?
1404,1404,"You picked the wrong shithole to fuck, future boy."
1405,1405,Ugh. Is that really necessary?
1406,1406,"No. It's his ""Basic Instinct."" What can we help you with?"
1407,1407,I'm here to proposition you.
1408,1408,"LAUGHS Oh, boy!"
1409,1409,"He's really teeing it up, isn't he?"
1410,1410,Who gets to make the first joke?
1411,1411,I think we should all do it at the same time.
1412,1412,Good call.
1413,1413,"For $45, you get suckysuck."
1414,1414,"BOTH: I only do over the pants, mouth stuff."
1415,1415,Fuck!
1416,1416,The Proposition has a wonderful Guy Pearce performance.
1417,1417,"WADE: Wait, wait, wait!"
1418,1418,I wanna do mine over.
1419,1419,Give us the line again. I need your help!
1420,1420,"Trust me, I'm even less happy about this than you are..."
1421,1421,"but you unleashed the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!"
1422,1422,I can't bring him down alone.
1423,1423,So here we are.
1424,1424,"We're no longer accepting applications for XForce, unfortunately."
1425,1425,Even if we were...
1426,1426,there's a wind advisory in effect until at least...
1427,1427,We don't have a lot of time.
1428,1428,Your friend's about to make his first kill.
1429,1429,"No offense, but if you know so much..."
1430,1430,"why not travel back to when he was a baby, kill him then?"
1431,1431,"Or better yet, head back a little further, kill baby Hitler."
1432,1432,I use a device to slide through time.
1433,1433,"The longer I travel, the harder it is to control."
1434,1434,"I got two charges: one to get me here, one to get me home."
1435,1435,Well.
1436,1436,That's just lazy writing.
1437,1437,Your boy's gonna kill the headmaster of the orphanage tonight.
1438,1438,"After that, he gets a real taste for it."
1439,1439,"Like 10yearold Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!"
1440,1440,So he keeps killing...
1441,1441,"and killing, and killing, and killing. GUNS COCKING Until one day, he kills the wrong fucking people."
1442,1442,My people.
1443,1443,Relax.
1444,1444,I'm retrieving something from my utility bag.
1445,1445,It's a goddamn fanny pack...
1446,1446,"and you know it, you sick son of a bitch!"
1447,1447,The difference is night and day.
1448,1448,You remind me of my wife.
1449,1449,I'm sorry.
1450,1450,"I said, ""You remind me of my wife."" No, I'm sorry that you said that..."
1451,1451,while making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm.
1452,1452,CABLE: She always struggled.
1453,1453,But she was funny...
1454,1454,and filtered her pain through the prism of humor.
1455,1455,Something I could never master.
1456,1456,It was my fault she died.
1457,1457,It was my job to stop people like him.
1458,1458,I came close a few times. TOMORROWPLAYING He wasn't too happy about that.
1459,1459,He was trying to hurt me...
1460,1460,and he knew exactly how to do it.
1461,1461,OLDER RUSSELL: Blessed are the wicked who are healed by my hand.
1462,1462,CABLE: He came into my home...
1463,1463,and took the only thing that made it a home.
1464,1464,Sound familiar?
1465,1465,I'm sorry.Uhhuh.
1466,1466,"No, I'm really sorry."
1467,1467,But that isn't Russell.
1468,1468,It doesn't have to be him.
1469,1469,If you knew what I knew...
1470,1470,"Yeah, he's got anger issues..."
1471,1471,maybe a small learning disability...
1472,1472,splash of diabetes...
1473,1473,but nothing that can't be fixed.
1474,1474,If you could go back...
1475,1475,"and stop the people that took your girl, would you?"
1476,1476,No.
1477,1477,I'd buy them all a bouquet of hand jobs.
1478,1478,Of course I fucking would!
1479,1479,But I wouldn't kill a kid.
1480,1480,I'm not asking you to kill a kid!
1481,1481,I'll kill the kid.
1482,1482,I'm asking you to save hundreds of other kids.
1483,1483,Russell's gonna burn down that orphanage.
1484,1484,And I can imagine your dead girlfriend...
1485,1485,"would want you to do the right thing, wouldn't she?"
1486,1486,"So, what's it gonna be, handsome?"
1487,1487,Give me a chance to save him.
1488,1488,What? You said...
1489,1489,"once he kills someone, he gets a taste for it."
1490,1490,If we can get to him before that happens...
1491,1491,promise you'll give me a chance to put him on a different path.
1492,1492,"Define ""chance."" I don't know."
1493,1493,How long does it take to save someone's soul?
1494,1494,That's not...
1495,1495,I'll give you 30 seconds.
1496,1496,What? No! Best I can do.
1497,1497,Take it or leave it.
1498,1498,CABLE GROANSWEASEL: He's doing it!

1507,1507,"My beautiful, hairless, Twizzlerlegged baby boy."

1514,1514,"That was some coldass shit, kid."
1515,1515,DEADPOOL: And that is just the first five steps to a prostateassisted orgasm.
1516,1516,Where the hell are we going?
1517,1517,DEADPOOL: You said it yourself.

1530,1530,"I'm not a fucking racist, moron!"
1531,1531,That's precisely what a racist would say.
1532,1532,I'm with the old white guy on this one.
1533,1533,And that's a twist.
1534,1534,When this is over...
1535,1535,I'm going to fuck you to death with your own broken feet.
1536,1536,"And a sexual predator, too."
1537,1537,That's rich.
1538,1538,I should have finished college.
1539,1539,"DEADPOOL: So what exactly do you do in the future, anyway, huh?"
1540,1540,Some kind of soldier?
1541,1541,"Yeah, something like that."

2006,2006,a dab of racism...
2007,2007,a splash of diabetes...
2008,2008,and a wheelbarrow full of stage four cancer?
2009,2009,Answer: a family.
2010,2010,See? I didn't lie what kind of film this was.
2011,2011,If there's anything you take away today...
2012,2012,"other than the need to Google, ""What the fuck is dubstep?""..."
2013,2013,it's that we all need to belong to someone.
2014,2014,How something so small generates enough energy to reverse time is...
2015,2015,"Oh, just fix it, Eleven, or I'll take it to the Genius Bar."
2016,2016,Cable's gonna kill you when he finds out.
2017,2017,Never heard of him.

2032,2032,XForce is just a marketing tool designed by Fox executives...
2033,2033,to keep Josh Brolin employed.
2034,2034,It doesn't exist.
2035,2035,"All right, well, this has been pretty scary!"

2073,2073,"God, it smells like Hitler's anus..."
2074,2074,"which would makes sense, wouldn't it? Yeah."
2075,2075,I think we both know I don't have what it takes to do this...
2076,2076,so I'm just gonna change your diaper real quick...
2077,2077,"and then I'm gonna come back with my friend, Cable."
2078,2078,He loves killing kids.
