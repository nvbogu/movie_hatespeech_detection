5,5,"Jerry Seinfeld In mid70s New York, there were only two places you could even see new comedians."
6,6,A standup comedian was just a novelty act.
7,7,"They would have one in front of a singer or a rock band, and just to be that was the most glorious dream of my life."
8,8,That's all I wanted.
9,9,"And it's funny, but I was actually sitting on a ledge when I decided to make that leap, right here."

28,28,cheering And uh I'll tell you the whole story.
29,29,I'll tell you how it all happened.
30,30,I was living in Massapequa.
31,31,I'm born in Brooklyn.
32,32,That's my home borough.
33,33,"And then my parents moved out to Massapequa, which is an Indian name."
34,34,"It means ""by the mall."" laughter Even the Native Americans could sense, once the Jews and the Italians get out here..."
35,35,brickandmortar retail's going to crush.
36,36,Let's lose the teepees.
37,37,These people need parking.
38,38,laughter and applause So we moved out from the city to on Long Island.
39,39,"You don't live in Long Island, you live on Long Island."
40,40,"When you live in the city, people ask you, ""Where do you live?"" you go, ""We live in the city."" You don't live on the city."
41,41,laughter But if you move out of the city...
42,42,"You're in it now. Now if you go out, you're going to be on the island."
43,43,laughter Long Island's not one of those places you...
44,44,You can't get in it. There's nothing...
45,45,There's nothing to get in.
46,46,You just stay on it.
47,47,"laughter My parents would say, ""Jerry, we're going to the city today, so get ready."" We're going in."" ""We're going to get on the train."" We don't get in the train."
48,48,"You get on the train, even though you see trains, there's nobody on it."
49,49,You never see anybody on top of a train.
50,50,"But that's how you talk. If you want to live here, this is how you talk."
51,51,"""We're going to get on the train."" Why do you get on the train?"
52,52,Why?
53,53,So you can get off it!
54,54,"""Get off the train!"
55,55,"This is our stop!"" laughter ""We've got to get in the cab."" You don't get on the cab."
56,56,"You were on the train, but you don't get on the cab."
57,57,You get in the cab.
58,58,Why do you get in the cab?
59,59,So you can get out!
60,60,"""You've got to get out of the..."
61,61,We're here.
62,62,"Get out of the cab. We're here."" ""Why are you still in the cab?"
63,63,"Get out of the cab."" laughter ""OK, Jerry, what about Uber?"
64,64,"What do you do with Uber?"" That's the new thing."
65,65,Do you get in it? No.
66,66,On it? No.
67,67,Off it? No.
68,68,What do you do with Uber?
69,69, man You grab it.
70,70, man You get one.
71,71,No. No.
72,72,woman You just take it.
73,73,You take it! You take Uber!
74,74,laughter Because there's no money!
75,75,"It's, like, free."
76,76,I don't even know how it works.
77,77,Do we even pay for that?
78,78,"laughter I think it's just a free thing, comes with the phone."
79,79,Any time you're just like...
80,80,"Little cartoon cars, they go wherever you want."
81,81,"""How did you get here?"" ""We took an Uber."
82,82,"I don't know, we just..."" It's like M&Ms in a bowl, you just take them."
83,83,Just take whatever you want.
84,84,"laughter And uh so I came here and I auditioned on this stage, and the little signup sheet is outside, that I wrote with my little ""Jerry Seinfeld."" You know, it was just my parents' address, and ""type of act: comedian."" ""Any special requirements? No."" laughter And I only had one joke that worked..."
85,85,laughter ...which I'm going to do for you right now.
86,86,And...
87,87,"cheering and applause If you ever think yourself that you might want to someday do comedy, this is not the way you do it."
88,88,"Don't ever say, ""I'm going to tell you a joke now."" laughter So, I'm lefthanded."
89,89,"Lefthanded people do not like that the word ""left"" is so often associated with negative things."
90,90,"Two left feet, lefthanded compliment."
91,91,"""What are we having for dinner?"" ""Leftovers."" laughter You go to a party, nobody's there."
92,92,"""Where did everybody go?"" ""They left."" laughter applause That was it."
93,93,That was my first joke.
94,94,"cheering laughs And it was a pretty good joke, and uh they passed me on the audition, and I started coming here every single night."
95,95,"So, I grew up in the '60s, and I see a lot of beautiful young people here tonight, enjoying your life of uh..."
96,96,infinite potential and opportunity.
97,97,"laughter Because you're young and your life is still ahead of you, and it's all going to happen."
98,98,Let me tell you little punks something!
99,99,laughter and applause You didn't even have a childhood.
100,100,You had nothing!
101,101,laughter You had garbage compared to what we had in the '60s.
102,102,And you know why?
103,103,"Your parents paid attention to you, OK?"
104,104,They were interested in you.
105,105,"My parents, our parents, they didn't even know our names, OK?"
106,106,"They were ignorant, they were negligent, they were checkedout."
107,107,We grew up like wild dogs in the '60s!
108,108,laughter There was no nutrition.
109,109,"Nothing... of knowledge of nutrition, education, safety."
110,110,Can you even imagine the world I am describing?
111,111,"laughter No helmets, no seat belts, no restraints."
112,112,"Anything came to a stop, we just flew through the air."
113,113,"laughter and applause I was either eating 100% sugar, or airborne."
114,114,laughter That was my childhood.
115,115,"My parents, they did not know where my school was, they did know what my grades were, they didn't know where I was."
116,116,I was like a raccoon to my parents.
117,117,"You know there's one around, but no one's tracking the actual whereabouts."
118,118,"laughter I would roll out of bed and I would do a swan dive into Cocoa Puffs, Frosted Flakes, Lucky Charms, Fruit Loops, Sugar Pops."
119,119,"laughter I'm getting a little lightheaded right now, actually, just thinking about it."
120,120,"It was so amazing, and it was great  we were getting away with murder!"
121,121,"Life cereal  that was ballsy, huh?"
122,122,"That's a ballsy name, I always thought."
123,123,"""Life""!"
124,124,"""What are we going to call this?"
125,125,"How about Oaties? Squaries?"" ""Oh, no. This is much bigger than that."" laughter ""This is Life, I tell you!"" ""It's Life!"" What were the other names? How about Almighty God? Why don't we call it that?"
126,126,Who wouldn't want to wake up to a nice big bowl of Almighty God?
127,127,Or New Almighty God with Raisins.
128,128,"laughter And if you don't like it, you can go to hell."
129,129,"laughter So the beauty of the time, OK?"
130,130,"Parents, for some reason, had no idea or no interest that there's no food in any of this."
131,131,And it was great until the Cookie Crisp people came along and blew the lid off of the whole racket.
132,132,laughter There's always somebody who pushes a good thing just a little too far.
133,133,Cookie Crisp.
134,134,"laughter If you don't know what this is, this is a cereal..."
135,135,"It's not like cookies, it is cookies."
136,136,laughter This is your breakfast.
137,137,A bowl of chocolatechip cookies!
138,138,laughter This cereal should have been called The Hell With Everything!
139,139,"laughter Ice cream for lunch, cake for dinner, bacon and cigarettes in between. That's..."
140,140,That's the Cookie Crisp total health plan.
141,141,laughter I liked the Good Humor man.
142,142,I would wait for him.
143,143,"That was another huge thing of life, the guy who was the..."
144,144,"You hear that little jingle bell, and the white truck, and the little white suit, and we would stand in line behind the truck, and all the different ice creams that you could get was on the back of the truck, placed right over the exhaust pipe."
145,145,"laughter If you had a Dixie Cup, it was the equivalent of smoking a pack of Camels."
146,146,laughter Nobody cared!
147,147,These were good times!
148,148,"laughs movie projector whirring Jerry There was no drama in my life, or in my family, or in my world."
149,149,"Would I have been funnier if I grew up in Peoria in a whorehouse, raised by prostitutes?"
150,150,Absolutely.
151,151,But this is what I had to work with.
152,152,"My parents were really nice, Betty and Kal."
153,153,"I had a wonderful older sister, Carolyn."
154,154,It was a nice family.
155,155,"But I just always felt, like, ""Could you just leave me alone?"" My first thing I ever said  my first words were, ""Leave me alone."" I used to knock over lamps or something, and they used to say, ""Leave it alone."" And then, one day, I yelled back, ""Leave me alone."" I just didn't want the normal thing."
156,156,I just didn't want anything normal.
157,157,"I just thought, ""That world that these people live in is very boring"", and I want to be in a more fun place."" laughter I had glasses at ten, braces at 12."
158,158,"I said to my parents, ""Let's not stop now."" How about a hearing aid, orthopedic shoes?"" laughter ""I'm thinking about talking to a girl for the very first time in my life."" I want as much corrective apparatus on my head as I can possibly get."
159,159,"""I think that's what women like."" laughter I had a yoyo. II liked that."
160,160,The yoyo was pretty great.
161,161,That was one of my good toys.
162,162,I could do the yoyo pretty good.
163,163,And I read about the yoyo and found out the yoyo was originally invented as a weapon in the Philippines.
164,164,An interesting and obscure piece of information.
165,165,Hard to imagine Filipino tribesmen warring with yoyos.
166,166,"Planes flying low over enemy villages, they lean out the door..."
167,167,"clicks tongue laughter ""I think I got the chief."" laughter But I didn't have..."
168,168,"You know, there was no Chuck E. Cheese and Toys ""R"" Us."
169,169,There was none of that.
170,170,"So, you know, you just did whatever your parents were doing."
171,171,"Wherever they had to go, you know, I would go."
172,172,"So, my mother would want to go to the wallpaper store, that was my day, you know?"
173,173,And that was my mother's favorite store.
174,174,She loved those giant books of wallpaper.
175,175,"She would read them, turn the pages."
176,176,It was like the Koran.
177,177,exhales Huge. She was looking at the patterns.
178,178,"""Yes, I understand what they're saying."" laughter exhales And when you're a little kid in these places, you can't really take it."
179,179,"You know, the boredom is so intense, it's so powerful."
180,180,"laughter When you're five and you get bored, you cannot support your body weight."
181,181,You literally just... I would just...
182,182,I would just get down. I had to get down.
183,183,"laughter I remember going to the bank with my parents, and you don't even know what a bank is."
184,184,"You just say, ""Oh, I can't handle this."
185,185,"I don't even know what this is."" And I would lie down, flat."
186,186,Flat. Just...
187,187,"""Sorry, Mom. There's nothing I can do."
188,188,"This place is so dull, I cannot get up."" laughter This is what I think adulthood is."
189,189,Adulthood is the ability to be totally bored and remain standing.
190,190,"laughter You're in a long line somewhere, no problem."
191,191,"I wasn't going to Disneyland, OK?"
192,192,That's not... That's not going to happen.
193,193,It wasn't one of those things that you could do.
194,194,My parents were not taking me...
195,195,thousands of miles to another state so I could sit in a teacup.
196,196,"laughter Both of my parents were orphans, so the fact that I had a room with a bed, they were like, ""That's your ride. You can go on that."" laughter ""You're fine."" And I was fine."
197,197,"Sometimes, outside of these stores, they would have, like, two red, metal horses on the sidewalk, and that was pretty good."
198,198,If you could get ten cents and...
199,199,It wasn't a ride.
200,200,"You know, it was kind of a piece, just a fragment chipped off of a ride that landed there somehow."
201,201,"And it didn't do anything that would make you go, ""Whee!"" It would just kind of grind forward and back."
202,202,imitates mechanical grinding laughter It was like a grainelevator motor with just two horses welded on top.
203,203,"imitates mechanical grinding ""Are we milling buckwheat or am I at an amusement park here?"" imitates mechanical grinding laughter But compared to lying on the floor of the bank, this was Space Mountain to me."
204,204,"You know, I thought it was great."
205,205,"I would get off. ""Mom, that was fantastic!"" I feel 1,000% better."
206,206,"I'm refreshed, I'm calm."
207,207,"""I'm ready for the wallpaper store."
208,208,"Want to go back there?"" laughter ""I'm into it. Throw pillows, window treatments. Let's do it."" laughter My mother, she was always talking to me about uh... what she was going to do with the living room."
209,209,This was her obsession.
210,210,"She was going to fix the living room, change the living room."
211,211,"My mother would say, ""You know, if you make one wall of a room a mirror"", people think you have an entire other room."" laughter They believe this."
212,212,What kind of an idiot walks up to a mirror...
213,213,"laughter ...and goes, ""Look, there's a whole other room in there""?"
214,214,laughter There's a guy in there that looks just like me.
215,215,laughter And my parakeet would fall for this.
216,216,I would let him out of his cage.
217,217,"I always felt bad that he was in a cage, so I would let him out, and he would fly around, and he would go ""bang,"" right into the mirror with his little head, and the feathers would fly, and he would hit the ground, then fly off in another direction, a little askew."
218,218,"laughter But even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try and avoid hitting the other parakeet?"
219,219,laughter Look up!
220,220,What happened to bird'seye view?
221,221,There's a... There's another parakeet coming right at you!
222,222,laughter But I couldn't take childhood at a certain point. You get tired of it.
223,223,You actually get... I just couldn't build one more balsawood glider.
224,224,laughter You know what I wanted to do?
225,225,I wanted to do certain little adult behaviors that I would see adults do.
226,226,Like uh... I liked the way adults checked their pockets when I was a kid.
227,227,This is actually something I thought as kid. I liked the way adults did this.
228,228,"""Do you have those...?"" ""I can't find those keys."
229,229,"Bill, do you have my keys?"
230,230,"I can't find the keys."" When you're a kid, if someone asks if you have something, you say, ""No."" laughter Anything you own is in your hand."
231,231,"""Are you sure?"" You spread the fingers wider."
232,232,"""No, I don't. I don't have it."" laughter I wanted to ruin my appetite."
233,233,"I got tired of hearing, ""You're going to ruin your appetite."" ""Ruin your appetite."" As adults, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it."
234,234,There's no danger of running out of appetites.
235,235,"I could ruin 100, I still got thousands more."
236,236,laughter Why am I being so careful with each one?
237,237,I've got millions of appetites!
238,238,laughter I wanted to mess with the thermostat  that was another thing they wouldn't let me go near.
239,239,I don't know what the story...
240,240,"When I was a kid, ""What is with that thing? Why can't I go near it?"" laughter I even remember when my parents sat me down to tell me the birds, the bees, intercourse, procreation."
241,241,"I'm like, ""Yeah, when does the thermostat come in here?"" ""That's the secret I'm waiting to find out."" laughter I didn't touch a thermostat until I was 28 years old."
242,242,laughter I was in a hotel room in Pittsburgh when I finally got the guts to make it a little warmer.
243,243,laughter I didn't sleep the whole night.
244,244,I was terrified my father was going to burst in the door.
245,245,"""Who touched the thermostat in here?"" laughter ""You know, I set it there for a reason."" laughter Yes. Yes, sir."
246,246,man I recognize the bookends.
247,247," Are they always here, or is that..."
248,248," No, I put them here. Those are mine."
249,249,That's a Superman.
250,250,"You know, I love Superman."
251,251,So this is a...
252,252,This is KalEl on Krypton.
253,253,You see that he's in there.
254,254,He's in the rocket.
255,255,"And there's his dad, JorEl, and his mom, Lara."
256,256,"And then he goes in the rocket, and he lands..."
257,257,Where does he land? Kansas?
258,258, man Kansas.
259,259, Kansas.
260,260,"And there he is, and they have got the little Superman baby... right there."
261,261,"Yeah, those are mine."
262,262, What else? What's that?
263,263, man Whose books are those?
264,264,The books are a prop. They're fake books.
265,265,They're just props. This is show business.
266,266,I don't actually live here.
267,267,This is not a...
268,268,laughter You need to get out a lot more.
269,269,I had every comedy album and every comedy thing you could get.
270,270,I did a show with this puppet when I was in third grade.
271,271,"When I was a kid and a comedian came on TV, I would just freeze and stare at them."
272,272,"Being obsessed with comedy felt very liberating, because it didn't have to do with the real world."
273,273,"You know, a Mad Magazine, you would start reading it and you're going, ""Well, these people don't respect anything."" And that just exploded my head."
274,274,"It was just, like, you don't have to buy it."
275,275,"You could say, ""That's stupid."" ""This is stupid."" Then, one day, my friend's older brother told us there was this place in New York where young guys were getting on stage and doing standup comedy."
276,276,"Not like the guys on Ed Sullivan with tuxedos and cigars, just young, crazy people."
277,277,"Once I saw that this was going on, that there was a world, I went, ""Oh, I want to be in that world."
278,278,"I don't want to be in the real world."" So, I came into the city in 1976."
279,279,I told you that.
280,280,"Uh... At that time, New York, a little bit of a tough town."
281,281,"Uh... But definitely the best place, in my opinion, to become a comedian, because, first of all, everybody in New York is a little funny."
282,282,I'm sure you all think you're funny.
283,283,laughter That's why you like comedy  you feel you're pretty funny yourself.
284,284,You probably even think you could do what I'm doing.
285,285,You think...
286,286,"""I got interested in other things,"" but if I wanted to, I could have easily..."
287,287,I could have done it.
288,288,"""I chose not to."" laughter and applause And that is a good place to learn comedy, because in New York you've got to really have something to make audiences laugh."
289,289,"And at that time, also, New York wasn't doing so well as a city."
290,290,The city was going bankrupt.
291,291,It was also the same year that they built the Roosevelt Island Tramway.
292,292,"I used to say, ""Great, the city's going bankrupt."
293,293,"They're putting up rides for us."" laughter ""Maybe eventually we'll get a rollercoaster in the South Bronx..."" which would be the first rollercoaster ""where people scream on the flat part of the ride."" laughter And that was my second joke that I ever thought of."
294,294,"cheering and applause So I had the left bit, I had the tramway."
295,295,I was rolling.
296,296,"And I lived in a little apartment on the West Side, and it was very small."
297,297,It was just 15feet square.
298,298,laughter That is not a joke. You know that New York apartments are like that.
299,299,And I brought my little bed from my room to sleep on.
300,300,That was all I had. I didn't care.
301,301,"I I wasn't planning on really getting anywhere doing this, by the way."
302,302,I just loved it and I wanted to do it.
303,303,And so I lived in that apartment.
304,304,"Since I couldn't afford to fix it or anything, I would paint it a lot."
305,305,"Every time I painted it, I thought, ""Well, gee, now it's a little bit smaller."" And I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but it is coming in."
306,306,It's coming in.
307,307,"laughter Eventually, someone's going to come to visit me, open the door, there's just going to be a white block with an eye."
308,308,"laughter They will go, ""Wow! That guy painted that place a little too much."" And uh..."
309,309,"So, no money."
310,310,"We performed here for free, by the way."
311,311,Absolutely free.
312,312,And audiences were packing in.
313,313,"Just like tonight, they're packing in to see us."
314,314,"In the '70s, we were the new hot thing  standup comics, young people doing this thing."
315,315,So I would come over here in the middle of the day and make a hamburger.
316,316,They let us have food.
317,317,"That was one good thing about the place  they would let us have food and Tshirts, so I wore a Comic Strip Tshirt."
318,318,"I would come here in the afternoon, make a hamburger, and then I would have another one, another hamburger at night."
319,319,And I was consuming about 30 pounds of chopped meat a month.
320,320,audience groans I was like a trained seal coming in here.
321,321,I was just...
322,322,"Just feeding me, and I would come up, and, just, ""Tramway, left bit, good night,"" and that was, you know, that was it."
323,323,laughter Somebody gave me a shower radio as a present for my apartment.
324,324,I could have used a couch.
325,325,"Oh, shower radio, that's a nice gift."
326,326,No better place to dance than naked on a slick surface next to a glass door.
327,327,"laughter But I still feel that comedy culture, I'll call it, of New York City."
328,328,I feel that it's still here.
329,329,"So, I'm at a light, and there's a guy crossing in front of my car, and then the light changed."
330,330,It was actually my turn to go.
331,331,They were in front of the car.
332,332,"The New Yorkers, you know how they just raise their elbows up to pretend?"
333,333,"laughter Here's an impression of someone hurrying, but they don't go any faster."
334,334,Same exact speed.
335,335,"This is what it would look like if I was hurrying, but I'm not."
336,336,I'm just going to raise my elbows...
337,337,and do the fauxcourtesy jog.
338,338,laughter Somebody gave me the finger...
339,339,"on my way, which I don't care about."
340,340,I don't understand even why the finger is the finger.
341,341,"Someone picks one of their fingers, they show it to me, I'm supposed to feel bad."
342,342,"laughter Bad finger. This is a good finger, right?"
343,343,"laughter I always try and remember, if I get this finger, I'm one finger away from a compliment, so..."
344,344,laughter and applause ...it's not that bad.
345,345,"These streetcleaning trucks in New York, as a point of..."
346,346,What kind of streettheater absurdity is this?
347,347,Does anybody think these trucks are cleaning...
348,348,laughter ...the street?!
349,349,Do they think they're cleaning the street?
350,350,Are they just laughing their asses off in front of...
351,351,"""Hey, get all the parked cars out of the way, everybody!"" laughter ""We've got to make a huge, loud, annoying hissing sound,"" then leave a little pisstrail of water out the back..."
352,352,"""to complete our doingabsolutelynothing process."" laughter ""Wait until you see Ninth Avenue after we're done."" You're going to think you're in an architect's rendering..."
353,353,"""...strolling through a modern wonderland of the future."" If you're walking down the street in New York and you step in gum, and that gum stays on your shoe for a couple of blocks, whatever that gum picks up, that's the only cleaning of anything going on in New York City."
354,354,We're living in filth!
355,355,"laughter We don't even care, anyway!"
356,356,"A sentence never heard in the history of New York City: ""Hey, why don't we get a new awning?"" laughter applause ""We've got six pounds of bird crap on this one, where the metal frame is showing through."" ""It would cost us 200 bucks."
357,357,"It's only the entire appearance of our whole business."" ""I don't think it's a good idea."" I think it's better as a way for us to silently express how much we hate ourselves ""and the stupidity of people that even come in here."" ""Yeah, you're right. Let's leave it."" laughter Just landed at LaGuardia last week."
358,358,Always uh... It's nice there.
359,359,I like uh... I like the ceiling height.
360,360,It's a very nice uh...
361,361,"laughter It could be lower, but I think it's good. It's good."
362,362,"Named after the exmayor of New York, of course, Fiorello H. La Guardia."
363,363,"And I imagine it was quite an exciting day in his life when he got that news, when they came into his office and said, ""Mayor, we've decided we're going to name the new airport after you."" He went, ""Really? Which one?"" They went, ""LaGuardia, on Grand Central."" ""Oh, right, right."
364,364,"Yeah, I've been there a million times."" laughter I go through customs. The guy asks me, ""I've got to go through the bags."
365,365,"Do you have any alcohol, any plants?"" He actually says, ""Any drugs?"" Is this an effective interrogation?"
366,366,"Is anybody going, ""Bingo! You got me."" Oh, my God."
367,367,"I didn't see that question coming."" laughter ""Twenty kilos right there."
368,368,"You literally just completely caught me off guard."" New York in the '70s was a crime city, it was a cop city, it was a newspaper city."
369,369,"I always liked that whatever goes on in the world, it somehow exactly fits the number of pages that they're using in the paper that day."
370,370,They never run out of room.
371,371,They never have big blank spots where nothing happened.
372,372,"They must be, at the end, ""Get that paper out before something happens."" That was another perfect fit today."
373,373,"""That was fantastic."" laughter I like it when the cops catch somebody and they hit them with the nightstick, and they get them in the handcuffs, and they use the chokehold on them."
374,374,"But when they put them in the back seat of the police car, they always put their hand on his head."
375,375,"""You don't want to hit your head on that edge of the door."" ""That really stings. It smarts, you know?"
376,376,"Be careful."" laughter Why are these crooks and massmurderer, hijacker, psychopath people covering their faces when they're being hauled in?"
377,377,What is this man's reputation that he's got to worry about someone seeing him?
378,378,Is he speed dating?
379,379,Is he up for some corneroffice promotion?
380,380,"""Oh, if the people on my sales team saw me..."" laughter ...hijacking Egypt Air 747 and throwing bodies out onto the tarmac one by one, ""I'll never hear the end of that, I'm telling you."" ""They will needle me in that break room."
381,381,"You have no idea."" When they invented the stun gun, I wasn't quite sure what that was."
382,382,"It seemed like a gun that they zap you with it, and you just go, ""Oh, my God. I..."" laughter ""Are you OK?"" ""No, I'm fine."
383,383,"Actually, I'm just stunned that you would even use that on me."" laughter I wonder if you can adjust it to just ""taken aback""?"
384,384,"If you could turn it down and just zap somebody, and they go..."
385,385,"""Wow."" laughter ""You all right?"" ""No, I'm fine. Just..."" laughter applause ""I'm a little taken aback."" When I was 21 years old, the idea of becoming a comedian seemed impossible."
386,386,I was living at home.
387,387,I had a job a couple of blocks that way.
388,388,"I was sledgehammering walls down for $25 a day, and I would sit here and have my lunch every day."
389,389,"And I remember thinking, ""Even if I'm not any good at it,"" if I could just make enough for a loaf of bread a week, I could survive, ""and that would be the greatest life I could have."" Did you ever notice there's an insult on every roll of toilet paper?"
390,390,"Down at the bottom: ""facial quality."" audience laugh I don't like the insinuation."
391,391,What has my face got to do with this?
392,392,"And, yes, there was heckling and bombing, and someone once threw a glass at me that shattered on stage."
393,393,I remember a couple of people who were interested in a physical fight.
394,394,None of it bothered me.
395,395,"I was in comedy, and it just felt like heaven."
396,396,"You know, one of the big nights that I had here was my parents coming to see me do my show, because I had never..."
397,397,"For whatever reason, I was very embarrassed around my parents to show them this part of my personality."
398,398,"So when I started doing this, it was, you know, a little strange to them, you know, when I told them, ""I think I want to be a comedian,"" and they went..."
399,399,"""OK."" ""You know, you've never done anything funny."" laughter And so, eventually, I brought them here, and they sat right there."
400,400,"And I was so nervous that night, because I was showing them this whole side of myself."
401,401,"It was like my little gaycloset moment, you know, where I had to say, ""Mom, Dad, I'm..."
402,402,"I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm a funny person."" ""And I..."" I don't want to be ashamed of it any more, and..."
403,403,"""I want to lead a funny lifestyle now."" laughter ""I want to be with other funny people, I want to have breakfast at two in the afternoon."" laughter And I was out."
404,404,laughs And the other thing was uh...
405,405,meeting girls in the bar out there.
406,406,"That was a new thing, too, because comedians sometimes have a little difficulty in normal social situations."
407,407,"I can do this, for some reason, and I always... always felt comfortable doing what I'm doing right now."
408,408,"I could talk to all of you, but I can't talk to any of you."
409,409,"laughter I don't really understand that, but I've talked to a lot of other comedians that have a similar thing."
410,410,So when you...
411,411,"Coming here and doing a show, and then you go sit in the bar and girls would talk to you."
412,412,"And that was, like, unbelievable."
413,413,So that's why we never went any place else.
414,414,laughter Why would you not go where someone might be able to see you do the one thing that you can do that's kind of cool?
415,415,"So I started having relationships with women, observing them up close."
416,416,Uh... Especially their bathrooms  fascinating little wonderlands.
417,417,"I noticed that women need a large and constant supply of cotton balls, and men don't need any."
418,418,I've never had a cotton ball in my entire life.
419,419,"I've never bought one, owned one, needed one."
420,420,"I've never been in a situation where I've thought to myself, ""I could use a cotton ball right now."" laughter ""I could certainly get out of this mess."" Women need them."
421,421,"And they don't need one or two, they need thousands every single day."
422,422,"They buy beanbag chairs filled with cotton balls  two days later, they're all out, they need more."
423,423,They're on their way back to the store.
424,424,"The only time you ever see them is in the bottom of a little wastebasket, looking like they have had a horrible experience."
425,425,"laughter Tortured, interrogated  I don't know what you did to them."
426,426,"Once, a woman left three cotton balls over at my house."
427,427,It took me a year to use them up.
428,428,"Put one on the kitchen floor for cockroaches to think it's a tumbleweed, go, ""This is a dead town. Let's move on."" laughter and applause Or I go to the doctor."
429,429,"Before he gives you the shot, puts alcohol on your arm with a cotton ball, I bring one of mine."
430,430,"He goes for his, I go, ""Maybe you could use this one."" laughter Sometimes he would use it, take a penny off on my bill."
431,431,"Gives me the prescription, I take that home, open up the bottle, there's another cotton ball in there."
432,432,The cottonball syndicate was always one step ahead.
433,433,laughter But relationships contain tension.
434,434,That is unavoidable.
435,435,"It's essential, it's eternal."
436,436,"All relationships, there's always a little agenda thing not quite lining up..."
437,437,"between the two people, right?"
438,438,"And so every relationship you're in in life, there's going to be tension."
439,439,Just accept that.
440,440,"You ask any friend how their relationship is going, touching their face is the first thing they do."
441,441,"""How is it going with Judy?"" ""Not bad."" laughter ""Yeah, we're doing OK."" And the higher up on the face they go, the worse the relationship is."
442,442,"""I heard you're having some problems."" ""We've got to work on a couple of things."" ""I heard you might break up."" ""Yeah, I can't go any higher on my head!"" applause This is one of the things it takes guys time to learn."
443,443,Especially you young guys who have got it all going on in every other area.
444,444,But you've got to learn the flowers.
445,445,The power of flowers takes a long time for men to understand.
446,446,"To us, it seems, you know, like a frivolous thing, like an insignificant thing."
447,447,It is... This is key!
448,448,"laughter If there were no flowers, Earth would be populated by men and lesbians."
449,449,That would be it.
450,450,laughter Women are with men to get flowers.
451,451,That's what they want.
452,452,Men don't want flowers.
453,453,Don't give a man flowers.
454,454,"""Oh, I've got to take care of this now?"" laughter ""And what if they die? I guess that's my fault? I'm the bad guy? Fine."" But a guy walking down the street holding a bouquet of flowers, he's the star of that street."
455,455,No other guy wants to be with a girl on the same street as that guy.
456,456,"Because you get that, ""See?"" laughter ""That's what I'm talking about."" laughter Because he's got flowers!"
457,457,"He could have a severed head in the other hand, she doesn't notice that."
458,458,laughter He was probably just defending himself.
459,459,laughter That's why the florist is not really set up right for what men need.
460,460,"You just should walk in, you tell them what you did wrong, they give you the flowers for that, and you just move right out the back."
461,461,"They need to make up the, ""All right, your brother's not an idiot"" bouquet."
462,462,"The, ""Your career's important, too"" basket."
463,463,That would be helpful to men.
464,464,laughter I got engaged when I was 29.
465,465,Didn't go through with it.
466,466,The date wasn't good for me.
467,467,laughter Had to cancel.
468,468,"No, it was one of those things."
469,469,"You know, a lot of people go through that."
470,470,"The word ""engaged"" is a very scary word."
471,471,I I would change that if I was in charge of that.
472,472,"I don't know, women, or whoever came up with that word, ""engaged."" I just saw giant gears just going, ""Chunk!"" ""Engaged,"" to me, I felt like I was on the first hill of a rollercoaster, going, ""Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click."" ""Boy, this thing goes high."" ""Click, click, click."" At the top, they give you the ring and piece of cake."
473,473,"screams ""We're married!"" screams laughter chuckles Biggest step, I think, in relationships is you decide to have a kid."
474,474,I think you get to a point where everybody you know has pretty much caught onto you.
475,475,You need to create a new person that doesn't know anything about you.
476,476,laughter You need a relationship where someone's impressed you know where the spoons are.
477,477,laughter Where to urinate.
478,478,"But, of course, they mature, become intelligent and leave the house."
479,479,"That's why people get pets, because dogs stay stupid."
480,480,"laughter They grow, they get older, but they never catch on to anything."
481,481,"Every time you come home, he thinks it's amazing."
482,482,They go through the routine.
483,483,"âª He's back again! âª âª It's that guy with the food And the ball âª âª It's the guy âª ""How did you know which house I was in?"" laughter and applause chuckles And that's a tough thing for a lot of humans."
484,484,They have a tough time making that leap.
485,485,"""I'm going to have a kid."" I had a nextdoor neighbor one time actually had a pet monkey."
486,486,"laughter A chimp. And I thought, ""Come on, man. You're so close."" laughter I mean, if you need a pet that can rollerskate and smoke cigars..."
487,487,it's time to think about a family.
488,488,laughter What about men? Men like things.
489,489,"Building, fixing, working on things, or being around other men that are building, fixing, or working on things."
490,490,"If a man is in his driveway working on something with tools, every other man in the neighborhood is magnetically drawn to this activity by, like, some invisible force."
491,491,They just wander up like zombies.
492,492,"They go up to the window, they pull the drape back."
493,493,"""I think Jim's working on something over there."" ""I better get over there."" laughter They don't help the guy."
494,494,They just want to be in the area.
495,495,We want to be in the area where work is being done.
496,496,We want to ask him dumb questions.
497,497,"""What are you using, a Phillips head there?"" ""Yeah, that's a good screwdriver, the Phillips."" laughter You always want to hitch your pants when you talk about tools."
498,498,"laughter But this is why, when they have construction sites, they have these woodpanel fences around it, just to keep the men out, so they can get a day's work done."
499,499,They cut a little hole for us so we can stick our head in and see what the hell is going on.
500,500,"""Is he using a Phillips?"" ""Yeah, looks like a Phillips down there."
501,501,"That's a good screwdriver."" laughter This was the place that uh... really gave us a home, and we just..."
502,502,"locked onto it, you know?"
503,503,"For me, it really felt very Long Island, in a way."
504,504, Jimmy Oh?
505,505," Because it wasn't cool, Manhattan."
506,506,So we fit right in.
507,507,"Seven nights a week, we were here."
508,508,"Seven nights a week, for months and months and months at a time."
509,509,You would spend all day getting ready for the sun to drop.
510,510," Right, yeah."
511,511, Right?
512,512,"Until the sun dropped, we didn't exist."
513,513,"Yeah, as soon as it got dark..."
514,514, Mark That's right.
515,515," ""My life is starting now."" And how about when you walked in this door and all your friends are here?"
516,516, Jimmy Yeah.
517,517, Jerry And there's an audience in there.
518,518,It was amazing.
519,519,"To me, it was like high school without the school part."
520,520, Jerry Yes!
521,521, You know?
522,522,And we were the...
523,523,the stars of the football team.
524,524, That's right.
525,525, Right?
526,526,"Which none of us had ever experienced anything like that, socially, in our lives, prior to that moment."
527,527,"You know, you had to be a dysfunctional social person to confront this."
528,528, You had to be desperate.
529,529, Desperate.
530,530,Yeah.
531,531,laughter What else would you like to know?
532,532, We've covered many things.
533,533, man What's wrong with the Mets?
534,534,"Well, it's baseball, and nobody cares."
535,535,"laughter and applause cheering Here's the thing about sports you've got to understand, sir."
536,536,"This whole concept of the team  your team, my team..."
537,537,"""Hey, that's our team."
538,538,"The Mets, that's our team."" Really? Is it our team?"
539,539,Who are these guys? Where are they from?
540,540,They're not from around here.
541,541,They're just paid to wear those clothes.
542,542,The uniform is the only constant in the sport.
543,543,"The guys are moving around, different teams, teams are moving from different towns."
544,544,We're really just rooting for our clothes to defeat the clothes from the team of the other city.
545,545,applause That's what sports is.
546,546,We are rooting for laundry and nothing else.
547,547,I always find it weird how upset we get when a guy leaves your team and then he plays against your team.
548,548,"""Different shirt! I hate this guy!"" ""I can't believe he's wearing that shirt!"" laughter Everyone you see every day is wearing a different shirt."
549,549,You don't get upset with them for some reason. I don't know.
550,550,But I'm excited for the clothes that you're wearing tonight.
551,551,Your clothes got out.
552,552,"That's a big night for them, too."
553,553,Clothes are waiting all the time.
554,554,"They're waiting in the store, closet, hamper, drawer."
555,555,"Everything you're not wearing now is home, hoping to get picked tomorrow."
556,556,laughter Laundry day is another exciting day.
557,557,The washing machine is a nightclub for clothes.
558,558,"It's dark, bubbles are happening, they're all dancing."
559,559,"They seem to kind of dance in there, don't they?"
560,560,"The shirt grabs the underwear, ""Come on, babe, let's go."" You come by, you open up the lid, they all freeze."
561,561,"laughter ""Could you close the door, please?"
562,562,"It's kind of a private club."" ""There's a dress code, no one's allowed to be on anything."" laughter Now, things progressing along in little Jerry's comedy adventure."
563,563,I got to a point where I could afford a maid.
564,564,The first time...
565,565,You remember these little firsts.
566,566,"I remember the first time I could afford a maid, I felt so guilty the whole time."
567,567,I was following her around the apartment.
568,568,"""I don't know why I left that there."
569,569,"I'm sorry. I..."" ""Obviously I could have picked it up."
570,570,"I should have."" I just didn't, and I don't know why."
571,571,"""I have no excuse. I apologize for that."" laughter This is why I could never be a maid, because that's the attitude..."
572,572,I would walk in the house.
573,573,"""Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this?"" laughter ""No, no, no. Let me clean up your filth..."
574,574,"while you just sit there like a subway rat with a trust fund."" laughter ""You make me sick!"" Socks hate their lives, we know that."
575,575,"They're on the stinky feet, the boring drawers."
576,576,They wait for the laundry.
577,577,"That's their one chance to escape, and they all know it."
578,578,"laughter How many times have you done a wash, go to the dryer, count up your socks, one of them got out?"
579,579,"laughter Escaped, took off."
580,580,Never takes his partner!
581,581,"""To hell with you! Tired of everyone thinking we're the same!"" laughter The dryer door swings open, the sock is always waiting up against the sidewall."
582,582,"laughter You're feeling around. ""I know he's in there, that little son of a bitch."" I know he's trying to get away!"" Sometimes they grab onto a sweater, gives them a head start."
583,583,laughter And off they go down the street.
584,584,hums tune laughter What can he do?
585,585,How is he going to survive out there?
586,586,"On a golf club, puppet show, amputee."
587,587,What are the options?
588,588,"laughter Sometimes you see a dirty sock on the street, just one."
589,589,"Just dirty, twisted, exhausted."
590,590,He only made it a couple of blocks.
591,591,laughter What about his partner left behind?
592,592,What are his options?
593,593,"""Oh, now I'm going to get thrown out because of him? How is that fair?"" laughter ""The whole drawer knew he was going to pull a stunt like this someday."" That's why he was always inside out and rolling down."

An elephant is certainly impressive when you weigh five tons wearing the smallest possible hat you can get."
703,703,"laughter And you know, this is a true fact about elephants in the circus."
