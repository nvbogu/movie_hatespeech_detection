26,26,"Yes, I can.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Come on. Just, like, a little bit.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He said the other day that I was mature for my age.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">That's right.

48,48,"I don't wanna stay here.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Sydney, I'm sorry. I would never..."
49,49,"Hey, hey.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Cee, right now, my priority is getting my baby somewhere safe.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Do you understand?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Come on, baby. It's okay.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No. James, please.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">This is what he wants.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">This is what he used to do when we were together.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He wants you to think that I did it."
50,50,"This is what he does.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He tries to isolate me and he tries to get me alone...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hey!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You need to calm down."
51,51,"You are scaring my daughter.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">If I were you, I would go to your sister's place.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You don't need to be here right now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Come on, Sydney.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Sydney, I'm sorry.

52,52,"You okay?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Yes. Please. Please, just go."
53,53,"Please.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Just... please, hurry. Please.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Stinson beach?"
54,54,"That's a long way from here.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I... I just need to get something.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Do you mind waiting for me?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I might be 2 minutes, I might be 20."
55,55,"I don't know...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But you can bring me back to the city after.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Sure, no problem.

Thank you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hi.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hey.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hey, guys."
56,56,"Welcome to Yulan.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">My name is Taylor, and I will be taking care of you this evening.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Do you know how this place works?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I'm assuming you order food, then you eat it. Hmm.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Pretty much. We just do things a little bit differently.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's all family style.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We've been here before."
57,57,"It's all good.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay. Can I get you started with some water?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We have still or sparkling."
58,58,"Just the free kind.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay, tap it is. Cool.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Thank you for being here.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I love you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You're like a cop, Emily,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">and you have this bruteforce strength</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">that is so, so comforting when I'm in trouble</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">and it is really intimidating when I'm not.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I mean, James actually is a 6foot cop,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">and he's, I think, really intimidated by you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">As he should be."
59,59,"I'd kick his ass.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I would.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You would.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I need that strength in my life right now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And I need you to believe what I'm about to tell you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay. What...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Thank you, Taylor.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">All right, uh, do you guys need more time with the drink menu?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Yes.

Yes.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I just walked right in.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I found something that can prove what I'm experiencing.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">That can prove that Adrian is stalking me.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">What is it?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's some kind of suit that Adrian has built.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And it has cameras, and it somehow...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">What?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No, please! No!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You can't do this."
60,60,"You can't do this!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He killed her! He killed her!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Please, I didn't do it!"
61,61,"I didn't do it!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No! No</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">he killed her! He did it!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS""> You have to listen to me!"

No!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Listen to me!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You motherfucker!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You killed her!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I see you!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I see you!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's here! He's here!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's right here, he's right here!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Please! You can't see him."
63,63,"He's in the room!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You have to listen to me!"
64,64,"He's right there!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's gonna hurt me.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay. Please! No...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's right there. Okay?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You'll be all right.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Surprise.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Cecilia...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Can you confirm the person in this video is you?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And can you confirm you recently fainted during a job interview</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">due to a high amount of Diazepam in your system?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I was drugged.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Uhhuh.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You also sent your sister an email a few days ago</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">saying you wished she was dead, didn't you?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I have something.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I have something that'll prove he's alive.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I found it.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">What do you have?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I can't tell you right now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's listening.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He's in the room, James.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You're saying that the person who killed your sister is in the room right now,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">but we can't see him.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Yeah.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">James...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Tell me you don't think I did this.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Tell me you know that.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I may as well have done it, though.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I brought Adrian into her life.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I did that.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I shouldn't have walked out on you and left you alone.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I failed you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Is this bed giving you any problems, Cecilia?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Is there anything in the room that is distressing to you?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay. Good.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I wanted to talk to you about something.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We checked the blood test that you had done at the hospital last week.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Do you remember taking those blood tests?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Yes.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Well, did you know that you were pregnant?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Didn't the doctor who took the test tell you?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No, that can't be right."
65,65,"That's...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">That's not true.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">The test shows us that it was pretty recent.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We can't be sure of exactly when,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">but it must've been some time in the last month.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Sweetie, is there anyone we can call?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Family?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Any friends?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's upsetting to see you in this condition.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Even though things ended badly for you and Adrian, I still look at you as family.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Are you my lawyer now?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I'm the lawyer for your source of income.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I represent my brother's trust.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">The money from his trust was payable to you</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">conditional upon you being subject to criminal charges of any kind,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">or being ruled to be mentally incompetent.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Now, in light of your current situation,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">it's my duty to inform you that any further payments are to be halted.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I know that you set up a bank account for a friend of yours to go to college.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">So, I take no pleasure in relaying that.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I used to feel sorry for you.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">The blood relative of a narcissist sociopath.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Permanent punching bag.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Handcuffed to his wallet.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But now,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I can see you for what you really are.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You're just the jellyfish version of him.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Everything but the spine.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You can try to litigate it.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But that's going to be an expensive option.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I can't see it working.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">However...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">If you sign this document and forfeit your share of the trust,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">it'll be a lot cleaner.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Or there's one option</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">where this all goes away.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Agree to have the baby</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">and go back to him.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You really think he didn't know you were secretly using birth control?</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">'Course he did.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You should've known he'd find out.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You knew him as well as I did.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He replaced them with something else.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You only thought you were taking birth control pills.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He was always going to find you,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">no matter what he had to do.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">He needs you because you don't need him.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No one's ever left him before.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But he's punished you enough now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Now that he knows you're the mother of his child.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's time to stop playing games.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">A new life with him can be given to you</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">with one phone call.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">A life just like your old one with Adrian.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Cecilia, you don't really have a choice right now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Right now, you're a murderer.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But I can change that.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Adrian killed my sister.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And you helped him.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I don't expect you to make a decision right now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">I can come back in 3 days.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Be good to yourself until then.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We'll be watching.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Grab the umbrella, grab your rain jacket,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">grab your rain boots, you're gonna need it.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You'll need them for a couple of days.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">This pattern we're in stays put.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">We've got this atmospheric river pointed right here al central California.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And that means cloudy and rainy</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">as we get through the rest of the week.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">This is a lot of moisture coming in.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's going to mean heavy rainfall and flashflooding concerns</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">right as we get through the end of the week.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">It's not until the weekend</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">that we get our next chance of seeing some dry conditions.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine even doesn't come until Sunday afternoon,</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">when temperatures hit the mid60s.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">But until then, it's gonna be cool, it's gonna be damp...</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Open your mouth.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Tongue up.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Tongue down.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Okay. Good night.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">You won't get the baby.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">And you won't get me.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">There you are.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Fuck you!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Get back in bed, now.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hey!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No!

67,67,"Turn around! He's right there!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Listen to me!"
68,68,"He's right behind you!</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Stay down.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">No, no.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Bang.</font> <font face""Comic Sans MS"">Hey!
