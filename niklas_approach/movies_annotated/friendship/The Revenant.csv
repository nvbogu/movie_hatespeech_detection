0,0,I was put here to kill.
1,1,"You were too, whether you know it or not."
2,2,"We kill because it solves problems, because after all the options have been exhausted and everything else fails, we have one way to solve problems."
3,3,And that's why we're here.
4,4,That's not why I'm here.
5,5,"I'm here to protect our troops, to protect our interests."
6,6,"I was put here to help create a democracy, to enforce justice."
7,7,Yeah? And how do you do that?
8,8,"You do that with this, this right here."
9,9,"After everything else fails, it all comes down to this, baby."
10,10,This is justice. Power is justice.
11,11,"Killing solves problems, That seems like the solution."
12,12,It's called right and wrong.
13,13,Does not compute.
14,14,Where does right and wrong factor in to this place?
15,15,You tell me  what difference does right and wrong make here?
16,16,"Shit, man, right and wrong only matters where it has impact."
17,17,"There's always a right and wrong, as long as you have the choice."
18,18,You ain't got no choice here.
19,19,Only choice is living or dying.
20,20,Going through life without a choice is like driving without the headlights on.
21,21,"Hey, hey, hey, quit fucking around, man."
22,22,What's the point of seeing when you can't steer anyway?
23,23,Fuck you. Turn the lights on.
24,24,Fuck you.
25,25,Fuck you!
26,26,Turn the fucking lights on.
27,27,You don't know what's out there.
28,28,"No, no, no, no, no, you don't stop."
29,29,You do not stop!
30,30,I just hit a fucking kid.
31,31,You don't stop for anything at night.
32,32,What the fuck was that?
33,33,It was a fucking kid.
34,34,What's a kid doing in the desert?
35,35,I don't give a fuck if you just hit your grandmother.
36,36,You do not sidestep protocol.
37,37,You do not stop for anything at night!
38,38,What if he's still alive?
39,39,Bailey's right.
40,40,"You're not supposed to stop, it's the rules. It could be an ambush."
41,41,You put this piece of shit in gear and go.
42,42,That's an order!
43,43,Fuck you. I'm doing the right thing.
44,44,Kill those goddamn floods.
45,45,Kill those goddamn floods!
46,46,Kill those fucking lights.
47,47,Kill those fucking lights right now!
48,48,That's just who he was.
49,49,He pulled four people out of there and then tried to put the pin back in.
50,50,He tried to put the pin back in?
51,51,I didn't know you could do that.
52,52,Apparently you can.
53,53,Did you know he was working on an opera?
54,54,"Barthenoy's many friends, some of whom have gathered here today, suggested that he was a man who loved his country and gave his life protecting not only our freedoms, but the lives of his fellow soldiers  in essence, doing God's work."
55,55,"Barthenoy was not only thoughtful, a responsible and a loving man, but a hero."
56,56,He is an example for us all.
57,57,"But although he is a hero, Barthenoy had not yet clarified his spirituality and his relationship with Jesus."
58,58,"Well, Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth and the life."
59,59,"""No man cometh unto the Father but by me,Â John 1436."
60,60,"Had Barthenoy the opportunity to look into the future and predict his own untimely passing, a passing which, because of his youth, is perhaps more tragic than most, one wonders if this burden would have been left unfinished."
61,61,"And so now is the time for us to look into our own lives and ask the question, have we embraced the path of the righteous?"
62,62,"And if not, how long should we wait?"
63,63,Until we are sick?
64,64,Until we are facing death ourselves?
65,65,Or until we stand before God in heaven asking for atonement?
66,66,"For none of us, except Lord Jesus Christ, none of God's children can see their futures and none can live forever here on Earth."
67,67,MAN. Did you check the gas?
68,68,Check the gas?
69,69,That gauge don't work.
70,70,You gotta use the stick.
71,71,Gas is all out.
72,72,Here's to Bart.
73,73,To Bart.
74,74,To Bart.
75,75,"Is it just me, or was that priest guy..."
76,76,Minister.
77,77,..was that minister saying that Bart was going to hell?
78,78,Joey!
79,79,I'm not saying that he is.
80,80,"I'm just...I'm just saying that the minister, His whole gig was that, you know, ""Unless you accept Lord Jesus Christ as your only saviour, ""you're not going to heaven.Â Whatever. Heaven's just a Christian recruiting tactic."
81,81,"Wiccas believe that after death one's spirit leaves one's body and transcends time and space and becomes part of a greater divinity of nature, Mother Earth."
82,82,"Now, does that just work for witches?"
83,83,Or can mere mortals get in too?
84,84,"It works for everyone, even assholes."
85,85,Perfect. I'm an asshole!
86,86,Do you think he joined the military to get away from me?
87,87,What?
88,88,"No, honey, i mean, seriously, do you think he was trying to get out of marrying me?"
89,89,No.
90,90,No.
91,91,"No, I do not."
92,92,"In fact, I think he was building up his courage to ask you."
93,93,Really?
94,94,"Really, I do."
95,95,He even had me looking at rings for him so that he'd be ready to ask you.
96,96,YouÂre an asshole I'm sorry. I'm just...
97,97,"Don't, Don't apologise."
98,98,"Like, this is...none of this seems real."
99,99,How do you do it?
100,100,How do you stay so strong?
101,101,You seem so strong.
102,102,"My inner strength is, um, a manifestation of my rigorous regimen of heavy sedation."
103,103,What...
104,104,Pills.
105,105,Lot of pills.
106,106,Vicodin. Valium. All the 'V's.
107,107,"I actually cycle them with beer or this little fella right here, Vicodin."
108,108,Yeah?
109,109,Can I?
110,110,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
111,111,"Um, I can get you more and whatever you need."
112,112,Thanks.
113,113,OK?
114,114,"Oh, fuck. I just don't know if I can make it."
115,115,He was in all of my plans.
116,116,We were gonna get a place together...eventually.
117,117,When he was ready.
118,118,I know.
119,119,And there was so much I wanted to say to him.
120,120,"God, if I could just have..."
121,121,"...just one more day with him, just one more."
122,122,It's gonna get easier.
123,123,it's gonna get better.
124,124,OK? Just give it some time.
125,125,"I know, I know, I know."
126,126,"I know it will, and I'll meet someone else."
127,127,But it...it won't be Bart.
128,128,H won't be him You know he never told me he loved me?
129,129,He never said it.
130,130,"I told him, but he never said it to me."
131,131,"He did love you, He does, he did."
132,132,He did love you.
133,133,"He did, he did love you, OK?"
134,134,OK? Yeah?
135,135,Thank you.
136,136,Oh.
137,137,"No. Oh, God."
138,138,We can't do this.
139,139,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
140,140,I don't want to make things worse.
141,141,How can it get any worse?
142,142,What the fuck?
143,143,Oh!
144,144,The sick...
145,145,You're fucking kidding me.
146,146,Fucking shit.

190,190,What the fuck did you do that for?
191,191,"What the fuck is going on, dude?"
192,192,"I don't fucking know, man."
193,193,I don't know.
194,194,You're supposed to be dead.
195,195,So I gather.
196,196,"Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?"
197,197,I just need your help.
198,198,I'm not gonna hurt you.
199,199,"Oh, God, this is just a dream, this is just a fucking dream and I gotta fucking wake up."
200,200,"Wake up. Wake up, wake up right now."
201,201,Wake up.
202,202,I tried that. It doesn't work.
203,203,So it's not a dream.
204,204,So I'm fucking insane.
205,205,That's it. I'm fucking...
206,206,I lost my mind.
207,207,"Maybe we're insane communally, together."
208,208,"And if I'm insane, that means you're not fucking here."
209,209,But if you're insane...
210,210,"Fuck, you can't be fucking insane, 'cause you're fucking dead."
211,211,"Oh, God, fuck. How do you know I'm not just fucking imagining you?"
212,212,"I don't know the test for that, man."
213,213,"Let's just pretend that you're not insane, I'm actually alive and we're having this fucking conversation, OK?"
214,214,That'd be more productive right now.
215,215,"Fuck, I feel like shit."
216,216,"Yeah, but you look terrific."
217,217,"Oh, fuck! Look at your fucking eyes!"
218,218,Shit!

226,226,You're fucking decomposing.
227,227,"Jesus Christ, you're fucking rotting."
228,228,Dude.
229,229,"This is not fucking happening, dude."

231,231,"I was at your funeral, man."

236,236,"I fucking touched you, dude."
237,237,You were fucking dead.

239,239,It was nasty...
240,240,Fucking neighbours. Really?
241,241,Nothing changes.
242,242,They're still doing that?
243,243,"Yeah, still."

246,246,"My funeral, My fucking funeral."
247,247,Really? Yeah.
248,248,How's Janet?
249,249,She's fine.
250,250,She's fine. I mean terrible.
251,251,"Terrible, devastated."
252,252,"You know, destroyed."
253,253,"Um, and, you know, she's just trying to deal."
254,254,"We all are. You know, we were nervous when you went over there."
255,255,"We just wanted you to come back safe and, you know, that.."
256,256,Your uncle Dave called and was real nice.
257,257,"He told me, and then I had to call and tell Janet, and she was just..."
258,258,But...but you're fucking here.
259,259,Fucking Jesus Christ!
260,260,"It's a fucking miracle, right?"
261,261,Jesus...
262,262,What's wrong? What's wrong?
263,263,Everything Yeah?
264,264,"I think it's my fucking liver, 'cause I don't know anything about livers..."
265,265,"We gotta fucking get you to hospital, dude."
266,266,Fucking... You are awful.
267,267,No.
268,268,"We gotta fucking find a doctor, find out what's wrong with you."
269,269,No doctors. it's just my stomach.
270,270,Your stomach?
271,271,'Cause you fucking haven't eaten in three weeks.
272,272,I'm gonna go get you a snack.
273,273,"You want a fucking snack, you got a snack, huh?"
274,274,"I got pizza. it's cold, but, um, you know, it's cold pizza."
275,275,"I can nuke it, 'cause it tastes better if I throw it in the nuker."
276,276,"No, just bring it."
277,277,OK.
278,278,You found the medicine cabinet.
279,279,Yeah.
280,280,OK.
281,281,Anchovies?
282,282,Yeah.
283,283,Since when?
284,284,Just...
285,285,That's disappointing.
286,286,"Oh! Fucking... Dude, that's my rug."
287,287,"Dr Forrest, dial 114, please."
288,288,"Dr Forrest, please dial 114, Buried alive?"
289,289,Yeah.
290,290,"I was definitely, um..."
291,291,I was definitely buried.
292,292,Um...it's the 'alive' part.
293,293,I thought I was dead.
294,294,Everybody thought..
295,295,"You were dead Here, check this out."
296,296,Do you have any STDs?
297,297,"Syphilis, hepatitis, anything?"
298,298,I was killed to death in a gunfight.
299,299,"Can you lean forward for me, please?"
300,300,And just look straight ahead.
301,301,I'm kind of decomposing.
302,302,"Can you take your shirt off for me, please?"
303,303,I need you to cough and...
304,304,Sure.
305,305,Military issue.
306,306,What's the problem?
307,307,"No, no, I can't explain!"
308,308,What's going on? What's going on?
309,309,Get down here!
310,310,What is it? What's going on?
311,311,Is it Bart? Barthenoy Gregory?
312,312,"Dude, cops. We gotta..."
313,313,"We gotta go, There's cops."
314,314,I think that this is maybe more than just a bug.
315,315,Fuck.
316,316,"What now, man?"
317,317,I know what I need to do.
318,318,Smoke some dope.
319,319,"OK, uh, so you take the couch."
320,320,The couch is all yours.
321,321,"Um, yeah, and, you know, I think we just gotta put a positive spin on this."
322,322,You know what I mean?
323,323,Put it into a positive light.
324,324,"You know, in Korea, the word for 'problem', Same word, 'opportunity'."
325,325,"So, really, we don't have a problem here."
326,326,We have an opportunity.
327,327,"A gargantuan, fuckedup opportunity."
328,328,"We'll figure this all out tomorrow, buttercup."
329,329,Jesus!
330,330,Shit.
331,331,"Oh, Jesus!"
332,332,Bart?
333,333,Christ..
334,334,Argh!
335,335,"Oh, fuck, Bart."
336,336,"Fuck! Fuck, Bad Fuck! Bart! What the fuck, dude?"
337,337,Ban?
338,338,Barf? Oh. Jesus What the fuck is happening?
339,339,Jesus. I just don't believe it.
340,340,"I know, right?"
341,341,And what did the doctor say?
342,342,"We didn't really get a reasonable diagnosis, God, it's unbelievable."
343,343,"Promise you're not gonna tell anybody, right?"
344,344,"No. I mean, yes, I swear."
345,345,"Not anybody  not Janet, not his mom, Not until we figure out, you know, what's going on."
346,346,"So he's not breathing, right? I mean..."
347,347,"Oh, God."
348,348,I couldn't find a pulse.
349,349,"This is disgusting, Yeah."
350,350,"Like, he smells dead, at least."
351,351,"So, why don't you want to tell Janet?"
352,352,"I don't want to tell nobody nothing, not till we figure out what the fuck."
353,353,So what's the prognosis?
354,354,Well. his aura looks like shit.
355,355,"Oh, his aura looks like..."
356,356,Is he dead?
357,357,"Yeah, he's dead."
358,358,Dead dead?
359,359,Doornail dead.
360,360,What the fuck?
361,361,"He was walking around, puking up blood, being a general pain in the ass not four fucking hours ago."
362,362,And then he just arrested?
363,363,Arrested?
364,364,Died.
365,365,Oh.
366,366,"Maybe, like, his vital signs are so low he just appears to be dead, He's been embalmed, Joey."
367,367,So...what do we do?
368,368,Chop off his head.
369,369,What?!
370,370,You have to chop off his head and drive a stake through his heart.
371,371,Why would I do that?
372,372,Because he's undead Undead?
373,373,He's a vampire.
374,374,A vampire!
375,375,"Yes, Joey, a vampire, a creature of the night."
376,376,And tonight he'll probably come back again from death.
377,377,A vampire? You're a fucking idiot.
378,378,What's wrong with you?
379,379,"Joey, I'm serious."
380,380,"Yeah, I'm serious, Matty."
381,381,"You're a fucking retard, OK?"
382,382,There's a science explanation for what's happening here.
383,383,"OK, like what?"
384,384,Like he's sick.
385,385,He has a virus. Gulf War syndrome.
386,386,"Joey, I'm a nurse."
387,387,He died over a month ago.
388,388,"We buried him two days ago, What does this look like to you?"
389,389,OK. Alright.
390,390,"Vampires have fangs, right?"
391,391,"Look, huh?"
392,392,"Eugh, gross."
393,393,No fangs.
394,394,Maybe they take some time to grow in.
395,395,"Yeah, maybe your theory is shit 'cause he died, like, a month ago, OK, so what's he doing on your floor?"
396,396,I don't know.
397,397,That's what I called you for.
398,398,You have to chop off his head.
399,399,"OK, or else?"
400,400,"Or else, Joey, he'll roam the countryside in search of victims to satiate his thirst for human blood."
401,401,"This is ludicrous, OK?"
402,402,He's not a vampire. He's a dead guy.
403,403,I'm gonna take him to the mortuary and let the morticians deal with him.
404,404,"Alright, do what you want."
405,405,it's not my problem.
406,406,"But if they don't chop off his head, he will be back."
407,407,"Oh, my God, where I live, on planet Earth, there's no such thing as vampires."
408,408,"You know, believe what you want, but when he rises again and starts taking the lives of the innocent, the blood will be on your hands."
409,409,"It's up to you, Joey."
410,410,He will need to drink human blood.
411,411,"If he doesn't, his soul will be in eternal agony."
412,412,"If you're really his friend, you'll put his soul to rest and chop off his head, Mathilda, not a word to anyone."
413,413,Promise me!
414,414,"I promise, I do. Kisses."
415,415,"Holy shit, dude."
416,416,You scared the piss out of me.
417,417,Fuck. Why am I so stiff?
418,418,I usually say that in the morning too.
419,419,Was I asleep?

457,457,"Just hurry up, please, What are you using it for?"
458,458,"Hey, that's none of your business."
459,459,I'm a nurse. Of course it's my business.
460,460,I can't indiscriminately dole out pints of blood to every strungout buffoon who wanders in off the street.
461,461,"Someone could get the wrong type and blam, that's it."
462,462,"So, what blood type?"

562,562,"No, let's just experiment."
563,563,"Alright, so the crucifix doesn't work."
564,564,Hold out your hands.
565,565,Joey!
566,566,"This is actual holy water, OK."
567,567,"An actual Catholic priest blessed this shit right in front of me, Please, just hold out your hands."
568,568,"No, this is ridiculous."
569,569,"This is ridiculous, OK?"
570,570,This whole thing is fucking ridiculous.
571,571,Hold your hand out.
572,572,OK.
573,573,Well?
574,574,"Oh, fuck."
575,575,That's not wat..
576,576,What the fuck is...
577,577,Holy shit!
578,578,What the fuck?!
579,579,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
580,580,"Fuck, Bart, I'm fucking sorry, dude."
581,581,"Oh, my God!"
582,582,Why did you do this?!
583,583,Fuck. What do I do?
584,584,What's wrong?
585,585,Why did you pour water on my hand?
586,586,It didn't do shit.
587,587,"Oh, you fucking asshole."
588,588,"Such an asshole, man Who was stroking your hair last night when you were drinking blood?"
589,589,"You were, yeah."
590,590,Human blood. Fuck it.
591,591,"Look, alright, OK, OK, I did some research, and you're either a zombie or a vampire, Good. Zombie or a vampire."
592,592,I knew there had to be a scientific explanation for this.
593,593,"Well... Look, we basically categorise you as definitely undead."
594,594,"Alright, There's one catch, Joey."
595,595,There's no such thing as vampires or zombies.
596,596,Not according to the internet.
597,597,"God, the internet."
598,598,What do they say about Bigfoot on the internet?
599,599,"Bart, you're clearly not Bigfoot you're way too short, you're not covered in hair, your feet are too small."
600,600,"OK, OK, alright."
601,601,"So, zombie, check this out."
602,602,"""A zombie is a dead human or animal corpse ""that has been resuscitated from death ""by virtue of a curse, plague or other unnatural cause."" Huh? Huh? Who does that sound like, right?"
603,603,"""Zombies are automatons with little to no mental functions,""  you  ""limited reasoning power,""  you  ""and virtually no innate drive,Â  again, you  ""aside from the urge to feed on the flesh or brains of the living."" So I'm a zombie."
604,604,No.
605,605,"Horst in 'Schriften und Hypothesen Uber die Vampyren' defines a vampire as ""a dead body which continues to live in the grave, ""which it leaves, however, by night ""for the purpose of sucking the blood of the living, ""whereby it is nourished, preserved in good condition, ""instead of becoming decomposed like other dead bodies.Â And Scoffern in 'Stray Leaves of Science And Folklore' writes, ""The best definition I can give of a vampire ""is a living, mischievous and murderous dead body."
606,606,"""A living dead body.Â So I'm a vampire."
607,607,You're a revenant.
608,608,A revenant?
609,609,One who returns from the dead in corporeal form.
610,610,"Yeah. Yeah, that's me."
611,611,"So, what the hell do you do  drink holy water and recite the Lord's Prayer backwards, what?"
612,612,"There is, er, one..,one cure and that is chopping off your head and driving a stake through your body."
613,613,"Well... Oh, fuck!"
614,614,Fuck.
615,615,"So, what are we gonna do?"
616,616,"Here we go, here we go."
617,617,Here we go.
618,618,"Hey, man, how you doing, huh?"
619,619,"Hey, man, we got some work for you. Hop in."
620,620,"Oh, thank you very much, sir, but how about just some money so I can buy some food?"
621,621,Please don't touch the car.
622,622,"We'll give you some food, OK?"
623,623,"So come on in, we got food for you."
624,624,"Oh...no, man. Thanks."
625,625,"How about just a dollar, maybe $2."
626,626,OK.
627,627,"Well, here's the thing  your sign says you will work for food."
628,628,"So we've got work for you, then we're gonna give you some food  you'll work for food."
629,629,You understand what I mean?
630,630,So come on in.
631,631,"Hey, man, I'm just trying to make ends meet, you know."
632,632,So you will work for food?
633,633,Money would be better.
634,634,"I mean, I'm just trying to make things happen, and kind of burn the candle at both ends."
635,635,Burn the candle at both ends?
636,636,Burn the candle at both ends.
637,637,"So whoa, whoa, whoa, let's revisit this for a moment OK?"
638,638,What do you mean 'missed'?
639,639,You want me to kill them?
640,640,These are the dregs of society.
641,641,"They have no jobs, no family, you know what I'm saying?"
642,642,They make no contribution whatsoever.
643,643,You think someone's gonna notice if they don't show up at the freeway exit ramp one day?
644,644,I'm not killing anybody.
645,645,You gone fucking crazy?
646,646,"You know what, maybe I am crazy."
647,647,"You show up, come back from the dead magically, soliciting my help to procure human blood so you don't rot."
648,648,"Yeah, crazy  reasonable explanation, Here we go, filthy meal coming up."
649,649,"Hey, there, pops, got some work for you for food."
650,650,"Oh, yeah?"
651,651,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
652,652,"Why don't you hop in, OK?"
653,653,"How about some money, man?"
654,654,Give me some money.
655,655,"No, no, no, no."
656,656,"We have food for you if you work for us, like the sign says  you know, the sign that you're holding?"
657,657,What?
658,658,The sign.
659,659,What?
660,660,"""Will work for food."" Who the fuck do you think I am, your nigger?!"
661,661,"Oh, wow."
662,662,"Get outta the car, white boy!"
663,663,"Alright, alright. Alright."
664,664,Outta the car! Put them up.
665,665,"OK Hey, will you work for food?"
666,666,"I don't do that shit, man."
667,667,Huh?
668,668,"I ain't no faggot, I don't do that shit."
669,669,"No, no, no, no, I..."
670,670,"Hey, you're looking for Boystown  Santa Monica Boulevard."

685,685,"Huh, what are you gonna do?"
686,686,ohm Jesus!
