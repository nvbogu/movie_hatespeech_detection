0,0,There's a meadow in my perfect world.
1,1,Where wind dances the branches of a tree.
2,2,Casting leopard spots of light across the face of a pond.
3,3,The tree stands tall and grand and alone.
4,4,Shading the world beneath it.
5,5,"It is here, in the cradle of all I hold dear, I guard every memory of you."
6,6,"And when I find myself frozen in the mud of the real far from your loving eyes, I will return to this place, close mine, and take solace in the simple perfection of knowing you."
7,7,Hey.
8,8,You got blood on your shirt.
9,9,"Yeah, I just came from work."
10,10,Who's the victim today?
11,11,Looks like it's gonna be me.
12,12,Want some coffee?
13,13,Sure.
14,14,"So, I gotta go to the Rez tomorrow."
15,15,Figure I'd take Casey by to see your folks.
16,16,Something killed a yearling in the pasture behind their house.
17,17,"Yeah, that's why I'm going."
18,18,"Don't let Casey out of your sight on the Rez, okay?"
19,19,"Like I said, I'm gonna leave him with your folks while I scout."
20,20,It's too cold to drag him through the snow.
21,21,You know what I mean.
22,22,I know.
23,23,Yeah.
24,24,Case!
25,25,Dad?
26,26,"Come on, bud."
27,27," Okay, I'm coming!"
28,28, Time to go.
29,29,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
30,30,What's your BB gun pointing at right now?
31,31,"Come here, come down here."
32,32,"Sorry, Dad."
33,33,"Hey, what's the rule, bud?"
34,34,"Okay, gun's always loaded even if it ain't. Right?"
35,35, Yes.
36,36," Okay. Come on, buddy."
37,37,Put that in the truck.
38,38,Hurry up.
39,39, Okay.
40,40, Don't run.
41,41,I'll be back Monday afternoon.
42,42,"Just be careful on the road, okay?"
43,43,This won't be my first snowstorm in a car.
44,44,Okay.
45,45,Is this it?
46,46,Yeah.
47,47,"Here you go, buddy."
48,48,"You know, it's a good town, Wilma."
49,49,They got good schools there.
50,50,"If I get the job, we're gonna have to talk about his child support."
51,51,Jackson's a lot more expensive.
52,52,"Well, you go get that job and we'll figure it out from there."
53,53,Don't you worry 'bout it.
54,54,"Take Togwotee Pass, and don't go through Pinedale, okay?"
55,55,"This uh, this storm's comin' in from the south, so."
56,56,"Yeah, you couldn't drag me through Pinedale with a rope."
57,57,I'll never set foot in that town again.
58,58,"Well, good luck, okay?"
59,59,"Better hurry it up, he gets hungry."
60,60,"Chow time, boys."
61,61,You okay?
62,62,Fine.
63,63,Gotta push his nose back when he rubs up on you like that.
64,64, Okay?
65,65, Okay.
66,66,"Hey, look."
67,67,Told you I'd get your hat dirty.
68,68,He's got the height advantage on me is the deal.
69,69,Is that right?
70,70,"Well, let's fix that."
71,71,Come on.
72,72,You gotta earn his respect from him.
73,73,"And when you do that, you stand in your own ground."
74,74,"So, let's get you up on there."
75,75,"Just like I showed you, right?"
76,76,Who's got the height advantage now?
77,77,Huh? Who's got the height advantage? Just back him up.
78,78,Be gentle.
79,79,Till he tells you not to be.
80,80,Take him around.
81,81,That's it.
82,82,Pass right by his food.
83,83,Keep on going.
84,84,Keep on going.
85,85,There you go.
86,86,You show him who's boss.
87,87,You wanna side pass him over this way?
88,88,Whoa.
89,89,There you go.
90,90,"That's it, son."
91,91,Keep comin'.
92,92,Back him up. He wants his food.
93,93,Back him up.
94,94,Look at that.
95,95,"All right, come on in."
96,96,How 'bout that? Good job.
97,97,Come over here.
98,98,Put your hand up on his nose.
99,99,"Let him smell you, let him breathe you, let him know you."
100,100,"He'll love you forever, okay?"
101,101,"Hey, So, what do you think of that, son?"
102,102,"That was pretty cowboy, huh?"
103,103,"No, son."
104,104,That was all Arapaho.
105,105,"Hey, grandson!"
106,106,Grandma's making you frybread.
107,107, Did you have breakfast?
108,108, Just eggs.
109,109,"Well, go ahead, get you some."
110,110," Horses sense the storm, huh?"
111,111, Yeah.
112,112,"So, police chief called you to hunt the lion, eh?"
113,113,He called me to hunt something.
114,114,I heard you lost a steer.
115,115,"Yeah, I'll show where."
116,116,It's a lion.
117,117, Is that right?
118,118, Come on.
119,119,How's Wilma?
120,120,She got a job interview.
121,121,"In Jackson, some hotel, I think."
122,122, Jackson Hole.
123,123, Yeah.
124,124,"Gonna live with the millionaires, eh?"
125,125,I dunno about that.
126,126,I think the billionaires chased out the millionaires years ago.
127,127,"Ah, save your money."
128,128,"When the wolves start eating their Golden Retrievers, that land's gonna go for pennies on the dollar."
129,129,"Yes, sir."
130,130,Tell me what that is.
131,131,Yeah.
132,132,"Well, it's a lion, all right."
133,133,There's two!
134,134,Three!
135,135,She's got both of last year's kits with her.
136,136,"They chased your steer around for a while, it seems."
137,137,That's what the tracks say.
138,138,Mama's teachin' her kits how to hunt.
139,139,But she's teachin' 'em on livestock.
140,140,Mama just got her whole family killed.
141,141,Got gas in your sled?
142,142,Far from your loving eyes.
143,143,I return to this place.
144,144,And close my eyes again.
145,145,Far from your loving eyes.
146,146,Alone among the wind I run.
147,147,I need emergency assistance.
148,148,"Repeat, emergency assistance requested. Come back."
149,149,Fremont County Sheriff's office.
150,150,What's your location?
151,151,"The Wind River Indian Reservation, east of Boulder Flats."
152,152,"FBI taking a while, eh."
153,153,"Yeah, the road out of Riverton's bad."
154,154,I don't wanna move her until they have a look.
155,155,But I'm not gonna try to pull her out after dark.
156,156,We gotta get this show on the road.
157,157,"We're losin' the tracks, Ben."
158,158,"Well, it is comin' down pretty good."
159,159,You should let me follow 'em while I still can.
160,160,"Can't let you do that until it's okayed by the FBI, Cory."
161,161,Call her folks yet?
162,162,"No, I wanna take the body to Lander."
163,163,"I know it looks like Natalie, but then..."
164,164,It's Natalie.
165,165,There's your feds.
166,166,What are these fools doing?
167,167,They can't see the road.
168,168,We don't have time for this.
169,169,I'll get 'em.
170,170,Your destination is on the left.
171,171,Turn left.
172,172,You FBI?
173,173,Are you Tribal Police?
174,174,"No, I'm here to take you to 'em."
175,175,"Look, it's very close."
176,176,"Just follow me, okay?"
177,177,Yeah.
178,178,I'm Jane Banner.
179,179,You by yourself?
180,180,"Yeah, it's just me."
181,181,"I'm Ben Shoyo, I'm the Tribal Police chief."
182,182,That's Cory Lambert with Fish and Wildlife.
183,183,He's the one who found the body.
184,184,"And this is his fatherinlaw, Dan."
185,185,He don't do nothin'.
186,186,"We got the same job, eh."
187,187,"Well, II'm sorry to meet under these circumstances."
188,188,"So, do you wanna show me the body?"
189,189,I don't mean to be rude.
190,190,"I'm just freezing my ass off here, so."
191,191,The quicker thethe better.
192,192,"Yeah, it's gonna get a lot worse if you go out there dressed like that."
193,193,The body's five miles on snowmobile.
194,194,I'm afraid you'd be dead by the time we got there.
195,195,I got the call when I was at a weapons course in Riverton.
196,196,"So, this is this is what I've got."
197,197,"Well, you should have a winter gear bag in that truck."
198,198,"Well, no, it's not a government vehicle, it's a rental. I flew in from Vegas."
199,199,"So, I'm just the closest agent to the scene."
200,200,You don'tyou don't think I canI can make it?
201,201,"Oh, you're from Vegas?"
202,202,"No, I'm notI'm not from Vegas, I'm stationed there."
203,203,I'm from Fort Lauderdale.
204,204,"I'm sorry, if we're gonna keep havin' this conversation, can we..."
205,205,Let's get you fixed up inside.
206,206,It's gonna be great.
207,207,"Thanks. Sorry, excuse me, thanks."
208,208, See what they send us?
209,209, Yeah.
210,210,Thermals can make underwear wedge up your bottom.
211,211,But I guess yours are already there.
212,212,"Here, this should fit."
213,213,You're skinny.
214,214,Thank you.
215,215,Do you have gloves?
216,216,No.
217,217,Goodness. What were they thinking sending you here?
218,218,Thank you.
219,219,And you bring them back the minute you're done.
220,220,They were my granddaughter's.
221,221,They ain't a gift.
222,222,You hear me?
223,223,"Yeah, of course."
224,224,Okay.
225,225,Okay.
226,226,"Hey, buddy."
227,227,I'm gonna need a couple more hours for work.
228,228,A couple? This is our day.
229,229,I promise.
230,230, Okay?
231,231, Okay.
232,232, Hang with Grandpa.
233,233," It's lettin' up, let's go."
234,234,"God, it was a blizzard Well, it comes in waves."
235,235,It could be sunny for an hour then you're right back in hell again.
236,236,The storm will be back.
237,237,That's something to look forward to.
238,238,Yeah.
239,239,Over here.
240,240,You got a positive ID?
241,241,"Not positive, no."
242,242,Natalie Hanson.
243,243,We'll call that positive for now.
244,244,Does she live closeby?
245,245,"Yeah, Fort Wakashie."
246,246,It's like a... north a ways.
247,247,"What's ""a ways""?"
248,248,About a 30 minute drive.
249,249,"Okay, well, she didn't run from home, then."
250,250,No one reported her missing?
251,251,Her parents?
252,252,Nope.
253,253,Yeah... that's why we called you.
254,254,How experienced is your medical examiner?
255,255,"Let's just say, he stays busy."
256,256,"Uh, order a rape kit."
257,257,"When he's done with the prelim, I want her body sent to Loveland."
258,258,And make sure her belongings go with her.
259,259,'Cause they need to get tested too.
260,260,I'm listing this as a homicide.
261,261,How well do you know this land?
262,262,Like it's my job.
263,263,'Cause it is.
264,264,"Well, is there anywhere she could be running from?"
265,265,Is there anything closeby?
266,266,"Nearest house is three and a half miles from here, southeast."
267,267,Sam Littlefeather's place is over there.
268,268,Yup.
269,269,Those boys could use some serious lookin' into.
270,270,There are no structures closer?
271,271,There's a drill rig five miles from here.
272,272,"They got trailers for the workers, but..."
273,273,That's closed for the winter.
274,274,"Okay, so why would a teenage girl be out here?"
275,275,"Well, kids come out here on their snow machines and have a big party in the snow."
276,276,"Not barefoot, they don't."
277,277,What do you think?
278,278,I only know what the tracks say.
279,279,"Okay, well, that's all we got."
280,280,"Well, come here, I'll show you."
281,281,"Right here, see this one, see how the toes turned out?"
282,282,The front is much deeper than the back?
283,283,That says she's runnin'.
284,284,"Come here, I'll show you."
285,285,She ran until she dropped here.
286,286,See the pool of blood where her face hit the snow.
287,287,"Now, it gets 20 below here at night."
288,288,"So, if you fill your lungs up with that cold air and you're runnin', it'll freeze 'em up."
289,289,"Lungs fill up with blood, you start coughin' it up."
290,290,"So, wherever she came from..."
291,291,she ran all the way here.
292,292,Her lungs burst here.
293,293,She curled up in that treeline and drowned in her own blood.
294,294,How far do you think someone can run barefoot out here?
295,295,"Oh, I don't know."
296,296,How do you gauge someone's will to live?
297,297,Especially in these conditions.
298,298,But I knew that girl.
299,299,She's a fighter.
300,300,"So, no matter how far you think he ran, I can guarantee you she ran further."
301,301,I gotta get back to my son.
302,302,"Hey um, would you be willing to help me?"
303,303,"Hey, can he assist on this investigation?"
304,304,What? He doesn't work for me.
305,305,"And you got a lion to kill, don't forget."
306,306,There's three of 'em.
307,307,And I didn't.
308,308,"Sorry, what is itwhat is it that you do, again?"
309,309,I'm a hunter.
310,310,You're a lion hunter?
311,311,I hunt predators.
312,312,"Good, so why don't you come hunt one for me, then?"
313,313,Okay.
314,314,âª Then I can't afford to dream âª âª And is it time I should be moving? âª âª Is it time I settle down? âª âª Will I sit still or will I feel âª âª The wheels a spinning round? âª âª Well I ain't the brightest âª âª Bird that ever flew âª âª I'm just someone you knew âª Dad?
315,315,"Hey, bud. What happened, you can't sleep?"
316,316,I had a nightmare.
317,317,Is that right? What about?
318,318,Who was she?
319,319,"Come here, buddy."
320,320,âª If I can't afford you darling âª âª Then I can't afford to dream âª Want some milk?
321,321,No.
322,322,No?
323,323,She's a girl who just lost her way in the snow. That's all.
324,324,Okay?
325,325,What's all this?
326,326,"That's work, buddy."
327,327,Did she die like Emily?
328,328,She died in the cold.
329,329,"So, she died like Emily?"
330,330,"Yeah, son. I'm afraid she did."
331,331,Hi. Sorry.
332,332,Yeah.
333,333,"So, you found town okay?"
334,334,"Yeah, barely."
335,335,Did the family identify the body?
336,336,Yeah.
337,337,Did they give you a reason for not reporting her missing?
338,338,"Well, she stayed with her boyfriend some."
339,339,They didn't think anything of it.
340,340,"She was 18, free to do what she wanted."
341,341,"Okay, Randy, you're on the clock."
342,342,"I got about five minutes of this in me, so let's go."
343,343,I'll be quick.
344,344,"Morning, Randy Whitehurst, I'm the medical examiner."
345,345,"I'mI'm Jane Banner, FBI."
346,346,"Um, as you can see here, she suffered a deep laceration along her brow line."
347,347,Two separated ribs.
348,348,Frostbite in both feet up through her ankles.
349,349,Frostbite in her nose and on her left hand.
350,350,"Uh, the frostbite on her feet is stage four."
351,351,You can tell by the bluing here.
352,352,You see that?
353,353,Yeah.
354,354,"Uh, vaginal wall is torn in different depths."
355,355,You think there were multiple assailants?
356,356,Can't determine that.
357,357,Could be one assailant who assaulted her multiple times.
358,358,"Uh, I swabbed her and sent the sample by courier to the FBI crime lab in Loveland, Colorado per your request."
359,359,Should have the DNA results in six weeks.
360,360,"Uh, those findings might help us make that determination."
361,361,What are you listing as the cause of death?
362,362,"Well, you're not gonna like it."
363,363,She died from a pulmonary hemorrhage.
364,364,"When... subzero air is drawn in the lungs, it can cause the alveoli, the tiny sacs in the lungs to burst."
365,365,Fluid builds in the lungs.
366,366,"And if the air is cold enough, the liquid in the lungs will crystallize."
367,367,"Ultimately, the victim met her..."
368,368,"Sorry, you're not listing this as a homicide?"
369,369,Can't.
370,370,You have to take into consideration the circumstances.
371,371,She was raped.
372,372,Repeatedly.
373,373, Beaten...
374,374, Look...
375,375,"Uh, the circumstances is your field, not mine."
376,376,"Now, let melet me show you."
377,377,"No, I don't need it explained!"
378,378,This is very prosecutable as a murder.
379,379,"I mean, clearly she wouldn't have been running through the snow if she hadn't been attacked."
380,380,But I can't list the cause of death as homicide.
381,381,And I can't get an FBI team to the reservation unless it's listed as a homicide.
382,382,"Look, I'm not here to solve this."
383,383,I'm just here to obtain a cause of death and send a team here that can.
384,384,"Look, present the rape, present the assault and I'm..."
385,385,Those don't fall to the jurisdiction of the FBI.
386,386,They fall to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
387,387,"Huh, hey, don't look at me, I'm used to no help."
388,388,You have six officers on your entire force to cover an area the size of Rhode Island.
389,389,"Yes, I know that."
390,390,"No offense, but this'll have to crawl in your lap in order for you to solve it."
391,391,I know that too.
392,392,We all know it's a murder.
393,393,"Have the US Attorney sign off on it, I'm happy to corroborate that."
394,394,But I just can't put it on the death certificate.
395,395,Okay.
396,396,Thank you.
397,397,I appreciate your passion.
398,398,It's not the Fed's usual response.
399,399,But Randy is on our side.
400,400,"When my supervisor sees this report, he's gonna want me back in Vegas."
401,401,"Not that I'm much help or anything, but..."
402,402,I'm all you've got.
403,403,Yeah?
404,404,"So, you never met him?"
405,405,No.
406,406,And she never talked about him?
407,407,Not to me.
408,408,"So, why would you let your daughter stay with a guy you've never met?"
409,409,Whose name you don't even know?
410,410,She was an adult.
411,411,Barely.
412,412,"I'm sorry, what does that mean?"
413,413,It ain't good.
414,414,"Um, look..."
415,415,I don't mean to offend you.
416,416,"I am just trying to understand the dynamic here, Mr. Hanson."
417,417,I'm trying to help.
418,418,"Why is it whenever you people try to help, it starts with insults?"
419,419,I don't know why she didn't tell me.
420,420,But she was 18 and I chose to trust her.
421,421,And I chose wrong.
422,422,"Okay, well, how about your wife?"
423,423,Did your daughter talk to her?
424,424,Do you talk to your mother?
425,425,Her name is Annie?
426,426,Is she here?
427,427,She's in the bedroom.
428,428,"Good, I'd like to speak to her."
429,429,Be my guest.
430,430,Thank you. Bedroom's just this way?
431,431,That way.
432,432, Jane.
433,433, Yeah?
434,434,"You don't mind, right?"
435,435,"Hey, you don't need my permission."
436,436,You're an adult.
437,437,Barely.
438,438,Jane.
439,439,I'mI'm really sorry.
440,440,Hey.
441,441,I'd like to tell you it gets easier.
442,442,It doesn't.
443,443,"If there's any comfort, it's..."
444,444,"getting used to the pain, I suppose."
445,445,Went to a grief seminar in Casper.
446,446,Did you know that?
447,447,Don't know why.
448,448,Just wanted the bad to go away.
449,449,Wanted answers to questions that couldn't be answered.
450,450,The counselor came up to me after the seminar sat down next to me.
451,451,He said something that stuck with me.
452,452,I don't know if it's what he said or it's how he said it.
453,453,"He says, ""I got some good news and I got some bad news."" ""The bad news is you're never gonna be the same."" ""You'll never be whole."
454,454,"Not ever again."" ""You lost your daughter and nothing's ever gonna replace that."" ""Now, the good news is as soon as you accept that..."
455,455,"and you let yourself suffer."" ""You'll allow yourself to visit her in your mind."" ""You'll remember all the love she gave."" ""All the joys she knew."" The point is, Martin, you can't steer from the pain."
456,456,"If you do, you'll rob yourself."
457,457,You'll rob yourself of every memory of her.
458,458,Every last one.
459,459,From her first step to her last smile.
460,460,You'll kill 'em all.
461,461,"Just take the pain, Martin."
462,462,You hear me? You take it.
463,463,It's the only way you'll keep her with you.
464,464,"I'm just tired, Cory."
465,465,"You know, I'm just..."
466,466,so tired of fighting this life.
467,467,What you do now is for your boy.
468,468,Drugs is his family now.
469,469,He's gone too.
470,470,"Lives just down the damn road, but he's..."
471,471,He's gone.
472,472,I expect they'll find out he's involved in this somehow.
473,473,He's staying with the Littlefeather boys.
474,474,That it?
475,475,Yeah.
476,476,"You drivin' this Fed around so she don't get lost, is that it?"
477,477,That's what they asked me to do.
478,478,Not what I'm doing.
479,479,Then what are you doing?
480,480,"I'm a hunter, Martin."
481,481,What do you think I'm doing?
482,482,If you find out who did this...
483,483,I don't care who it is.
484,484,You understand me?
485,485,Right where they stand.
486,486,Then get off my porch and go do it.
487,487,Natalie's brother lives here with Sam and Bart Littlefeather...
488,488,and a real piece of work named Frank Walker.
489,489,"Hanson kid's bad, but others are just stone evil."
490,490,"So, watch yourself."
491,491,Shouldn't we just maybe wait for some backup?
492,492,"Well, this isn't the land of backup, Jane, this is the land of you're on your own."
493,493,âª and if it's gotta be death or jail âª Listen to that shit.
494,494,Yeah?
495,495,We're lookin' for Chip Hanson.
496,496,He around?
497,497,"Not here, brah."
498,498,Who are you?
499,499,Who the fuck are you?
500,500,"I'm the FBI, are you Sam?"
501,501,No.
502,502,"You high right now, Sam?"
503,503,How many times have I arrested you?
504,504,"Chief, what's up, brah?"
505,505,Where's your brother?
506,506,"He's in prison, where you put him."
507,507,"What, no parole?"
508,508,"Well, look at that, the justice system at work."
509,509,That reminds me.
510,510,My PO told me to give you something.
511,511,I got it...
512,512,I got it right here.
513,513,"Wait, let me see your hands!"
514,514,Let me see...
515,515,Cory! Watch your back!
516,516,Fuck!
517,517,The other two's outside with Cory.
518,518,Let's go.
519,519,He... He's still alive.
520,520,We need to call EMS.
521,521,EMS is an hour away.
522,522,Just... just leave him.
523,523,"Unhunh, he's not dead, Ben."
524,524,Like I said.
525,525,Let's go.
526,526, You okay?
527,527, Yeah.
528,528, Skinny one's Natalie's brother.
529,529, Who's the other one?
530,530,That... is a Frank Walker.
531,531,Won't your daddy be proud.
532,532,"My dad's in prison, asshole."
533,533,"I know, I put him there."
534,534,"Tell me what happened to your sister, Chip."
535,535,What?
536,536,Don't play dumb.
537,537,About what? What happened to her?
538,538,Huh?
539,539,"What that cracker do, huh?"
540,540,"What, what cracker?"
541,541,Was she seeing a white guy?
542,542,Do you know him?
543,543,Do you know who he is?
544,544,"Do you know his name, Chip?"
545,545,You just said was.
546,546,Why did you say was?
547,547,Why did she say was?
548,548,She just said was!
549,549,"Because I found her raped and killed right over there, son."
550,550,That's why.
551,551,No...
552,552,What?
553,553,No!
554,554,"You go, I'm gonna get Chip over to Lander and see if he'll give me the name of this boyfriend."
555,555,"I tell you, this is how we find him."
556,556,"No, we go to where he works or where he lives."
557,557,"Yeah? Well, where does he work?"
558,558,Where does he live?
559,559,You think this asshole's gonna tell us anything? I don't.
560,560,"Look, I hear you looking for clues but you're missing all the signs."
561,561,"Come here, let me show you."
562,562,See this here?
563,563,"This is a sled track, right?"
564,564, Okay.
565,565, You see out here on the ridge?
566,566,"Here, use these."
567,567,Okay.
568,568,You see at the end of the rigde here?
569,569, Follow my hand. Can you see my hand?
570,570, Yeah.
571,571,"Okay, when I take it away, now look."
572,572,Can you see that?
573,573,Can you see the shadow there?
574,574,I think so.
575,575,Snow startin' to cover it.
576,576,Look up the base of the mountain there.
577,577,"See, go up the ridge there."
578,578,You'll see it a lot easier there.
579,579,See those tracks go up the mountain there?
580,580," Yeah, I see it."
581,581, All right.
582,582,Natalie's body was found just past there. Right?
583,583,Someone on their little sled right here drove all the way out there.
584,584,There's no tracks comin' back.
585,585,Why is that?
586,586,"I'm tellin' you, the answers are out there."
587,587,"Hey, look um..."
588,588,"I don't know how to do this, okay?"
589,589,I'm not a tracker.
590,590,"That's okay, that's all I do."
591,591,Look...
592,592,"You asked me to help you, right?"
593,593,Yeah.
594,594,We should go while I still can.
595,595,Okay.
596,596,Why are we stopping?
597,597,It's about to storm now.
598,598,The trees are too thick to drive.
599,599,Gotta walk from here.
600,600,Come on.
601,601,Put these on.
602,602,Okay.
603,603,Now what?
604,604,We walk.
605,605,Follow these sled tracks heading south.
606,606, Ready?
607,607, Yeah.
608,608,All right. Follow me.
609,609,Oh my God.
610,610,Oh my God.
611,611,We went on foot the last half mile of it.
612,612,"But we blazed a pretty good trail in the snow, so."
613,613,I can take your boys back up there if you want.
614,614,"Well, I'll talk to the BIA supervisor."
615,615,He just might want you to do that.
616,616,The security team over at the rig got cameras around the perimeter.
617,617,I'm gonna head up there in the morning.
618,618,"We might get lucky, find something on tape."
619,619,Did the two we have in custody say anything?
620,620,"They ain't the talkin' kind, Jane."
621,621,"These kids, they expect to go to prison."
622,622,It's a rite of passage.
623,623,"Hell, I think they look forward to it, you know."
624,624,"Three hots and a cot, free cable."
625,625,"Anything's better than being here, the way they see it."
626,626,"Let's just test their DNA against the semen, see what that tells us."
627,627, Can I talk to him?
628,628," No, Cory."
629,629,Anything they tell you would be inadmissible in court.
630,630,And then anything you'd tell us would render everything that resulted inadmissible as well.
631,631,What if I did not tell you?
632,632,If I just knew it?
633,633,"Yeah, Agent Banner. Yes, sir."
634,634,Ben.
635,635,I've known this kid since he could walk.
636,636,I gotta canvas the house.
637,637,"The uh, back door only locks from the inside."
638,638,Look at you.
639,639,Look at you. I didn't do shit.
640,640,"All you been doing is shit for the last three years, Chip."
641,641,"It's this place, man."
642,642,Look what it takes from us.
643,643,What it took from you.
644,644,I'm not gonna stand here and tell you that life's fair 'cause it ain't.
645,645,To either of us.
646,646,But you know... what do we do?
647,647,This land... this land is all we got left.
648,648,What's this we shit?
649,649,Only thing native about you is your exwife.
650,650,And a daughter you couldn't protect.
651,651,Maybe if you played detective...
652,652,That's not something you get to talk about.
653,653,You hear me?
654,654,Go over there.
655,655,You gonna lecture me about protecting people?
656,656,While you deal the shit that's killin' 'em?
657,657,"Unlike most people, you had every chance to get the hell outta here if that's what you want."
658,658,"You had the army, you had college, whatever, it's your choice."
659,659,Look what you chose.
660,660,Look what you chose.
661,661,God damn you.
662,662,I met him.
663,663,Yeah?
664,664,"Yeah, the motherfucker was almost as old as you."
665,665,I wanted to fight his ass too.
666,666,Natalie wouldn't let me.
667,667,"Guess love really is blind, huh."
668,668,He worked security on one of them drill sites.
669,669,This boyfriend have a name?
670,670,"Matt, Matt somethin'."
671,671,I don't know.
672,672,Who does?
673,673,Sam knew. Why don't you ask him.
674,674,I think you'll be talking to Sam long before I do.
675,675,You think this is who I wanted to be?
676,676,Man.
677,677,I get so mad I wanna fight the whole world.
678,678,You got any idea what that feels like?
679,679,I do.
680,680,But I decided to fight the feeling instead.
681,681,'Cause I figured the world would win.
682,682,What did I tell you?
683,683,Did he say anything?
684,684,"No, fuck it. I don't..."
685,685,I don't wanna know.
686,686,"You going up to the rigs tomorrow, ain't you?"
687,687,Yeah.
688,688,Natalie's boyfriend worked there.
689,689,"What? No, fuck, don't tell me."
690,690,This thing's solving itself.
691,691,Cory.
692,692,I want you at the rig with us tomorrow.
693,693,You don't catch wolves lookin' where they might be.
694,694,You look where they've been.
695,695,They've been right here.
696,696,Hey.
697,697,You okay?
698,698,Been better.
699,699,"Brings it all back, doesn't it?"
700,700,Maybe.
701,701,So you and Ben and this little FBI girl formed your own posse to go solve it all. I hear.
702,702,Just trying to help.
703,703,You won't get the answers you're looking for.
704,704,No matter what you find.
705,705,This isn't about Emily.
706,706,"Goodnight, Cory."
707,707,Matt Rayburn.
708,708,Do you know him?
709,709,That's the guy we found in the snow?
710,710,"Yeah, his fingerprints in the database."
711,711,He was a security contractor for one of the drill stations.
712,712,All right.
713,713,That it?
714,714, Am I fired now?
715,715, No.
716,716,"Why don't you come inside, warm up."
717,717,Okay. Yeah.
718,718,"You uh, want something to drink?"
719,719,Sure.
720,720,"Got uh, milk, coffee or well water."
721,721, Water's good.
722,722, Okay.
723,723,"Right, just make yourself at home."
724,724, Here you go.
725,725, Thanks.
726,726,"That's uh, that's my daughter Emily."
727,727,She passed three years ago.
728,728,I'm sorry.
729,729,"You wanna know how, don't you?"
730,730,"I do, but..."
731,731,Makes two of us.
732,732,I was working as an outfitter in Pinedale.
733,733,"There was a big snow, so I found myself with a rare night off."
734,734,"So, I go to a motel, call the wife, say, Why don't you come up, stay for the night?"
735,735,When you got two kids and you're up the mountain half the year...
736,736,We don't get much time together.
737,737,"So, we had Emily look after Casey, he was five at the time."
738,738,She was 16.
739,739,I guess word got out that we were out of town.
740,740,"So, some school friends came over, then some more friends."
741,741,Then uh...
742,742,And then some people came over that weren't friends.
743,743,"So, a little gathering turned into quite the party, I guess."
744,744,Then uh...
745,745,I don't know.
746,746,"You know, there's a lot I don't know."
747,747,Got that phone call the next morning.
748,748,From Natalie.
749,749,Saying that Emily was missing.
750,750,"She was worried, naturally."
751,751,They were best friends.
752,752,"Yeah, we tried to be very careful with Emily."
753,753,Tried to plan for everything.
754,754,She was such a good girl.
755,755,But we let our guard down.
756,756,"I tell you. You know, you may have kids one day."
757,757,You cannot blink.
758,758,"Not once, not ever."
759,759,Then there's a guy movin' sheep over by the Wind River.
760,760,He's the one who found her.
761,761,Some 20 miles from our house.
762,762,They don't know how she got there or what happened.
763,763,Autopsy couldn't tell us much 'cause the coyotes got at her pretty good.
764,764,"You know, I'mI'm sorry..."
765,765,I'm sorry...
766,766,Sorry.
767,767,Could you point me um...
768,768,towards your... the bathroom?
769,769,Straight right there.
770,770,Thanks.
771,771,"""There is a meadow in my perfect world"" Emily wrote that."
772,772,That's what got her accepted into the summer writing program at Colorado State.
773,773,Did she write it to you?
774,774,Doesn't matter who it's to.
775,775,Just matters who it's from.
776,776,"Look, I'm sorry about um, earlier tonight."
777,777,I'm just trying to do the right thing here.
778,778,"And I don't really know what the Hanson boy told you, but..."
779,779,I don't wanna stumble into something like today if I can help it.
780,780,"So, you know, if he said something that I should know..."
781,781,I'd appreciate if you shared.
782,782,"Well, all he said was that Natalie's boyfriend was named Matt."
783,783,"And you've already figured out who that is, so."
784,784,"You could've called for that information, right?"
785,785,I wanted to know why you're helping me.
786,786,"Now I do, so."
787,787,Tomorrow...
788,788,Do you think we could not ride the snowmobiles 80 miles an hour?
789,789,"Yeah, sure, if you wanna end up in a ditch we could've jumped over."
790,790,Great.
791,791,Okay.
792,792,You win.
793,793, Have a good night.
794,794, All right.
795,795,See you tomorrow.
796,796,See you tomorrow.
797,797,You're shaking more than she is.
798,798,It's cold enough to freeze a welldigger's ass out here.
799,799,"Yeah, below zero, I bet."
800,800,"Yeah, six below."
801,801,It's a lot colder up there.
802,802,"Hey, bud."
803,803," Hey, how you doing?"
804,804, What are you doing here?
805,805,There's tracks that lead from the Littlefeather house to the body.
806,806,"I'm gonna follow them, see where they go. How about you?"
807,807,"Yeah, well, Jane's the only one with jurisdiction out there."
808,808,Just wanted a few extra badges along.
809,809,You wanna walk 'em through this?
810,810,"Uh sure, yeah."
811,811,"Um, the drill station has cameras along its perimeter, so we're hoping one of the cameras caught something."
812,812,"And uh, we'll also canvas Matt Rayburn's trailer."
813,813,See if there's anything that links him to the assault.
814,814,You have a warrant?
815,815,I'm gonna ask real nice.
816,816,Can't get there from the Littlefeather house?
817,817,"That's a real tough sled ride to two canyons and, I ain't lookin' to dig you out, so."
818,818,I don't recommend it.
819,819,We'll take the refinery road around.
820,820,So you gotta drive Welcome to Wyoming.
821,821,Didn't you people get the memo that it'sit's spring?
822,822,"If you find anything, you call me on the radio."
823,823,Far from your loving eyes.
824,824,In a place where winter never comes.
825,825,Far from your loving eyes.
826,826,Alone among the wind I run.
827,827,Far from your loving eyes.
828,828,I return to this place.
829,829,Good morning.
830,830,Good morning.
831,831,Can I help you?
832,832,"Yeah, does a Matt Rayburn work here?"
833,833,Yeah. You know where he is?
834,834,I was about to ask you the same thing.
835,835,No. He got in a fight with his girlfriend a couple of days ago.
836,836,"She took off, he took off after."
837,837,We haven't seen 'em since.
838,838, When was that?
839,839, Three days ago.
840,840,"Hell, we didn't know what to do."
841,841,We've been waiting on corporate ever since to tell us whether or not to fill out his termination papers or call you guys.
842,842,Everything okay?
843,843,"Yeah, they're here about Matt."
844,844,Did you find him? Is he okay?
845,845, What happened to you two?
846,846, What's that?
847,847,You look a little torn up.
848,848,"Yeah, well, you hit one of these pine branches doin' 60, see what happens to you."
849,849,We run the property line twice daily.
850,850,Comes with the territory.
851,851,You should try using face shields.
852,852,"I requested helmets, supervisor says, ""Snow's soft, ain't it?"" Corporate's in Texas, what can I tell you?"
853,853,Does Matt bunk here on the property?
854,854,"Yeah. Yeah, we all do."
855,855,Can we see his trailer?
856,856,"Yeah, sure. Come on, I'll walk you up."
857,857,"What's going on, boss?"
858,858,They're here about Matt.
859,859,End of the line for you.
860,860,"So, did uh, did something happen to him?"
861,861,Do you know where he is?
862,862,That's what we're trying to find out.
863,863,His girlfriend filed a missing persons report.
864,864,How can that be?
865,865,I thought you guys found her in a snowdrift right before the storm.
866,866,Excuse me?
867,867,I heard her name go out over the radio when you guys found her.
868,868,I don't remember using her name.
869,869,"Well, maybe you weren't listening."
870,870, What the fuck are you doing?
871,871, What?
872,872, Why are you flanking me?
873,873, What are you talking about?
874,874,The fuck do think I'm talkin' about?
875,875,"You got us on three sides, dickhead!"
876,876,"Get your hands off that weapon, this is private property."
877,877, What are you doing?
878,878, Put the fucking gun down!
879,879,Put the fucking gun down right now!
880,880,Hey!
881,881,"Put it down, Dillon!"
882,882,Dillon!
883,883,"Turn away from me, drop to your knees, right now!"
884,884,Evan!
885,885,"Fuck you, this is Department of Energy lease on reservation land, asshole."
886,886,You're breaking the law by being here.
887,887,Hey!
888,888,"This is leased land on a reservation, deputy."
889,889,You've got no authority.
890,890,You think I don't know what you're doing?
891,891,"Fucking do it, asshole."
892,892,See what happens.
893,893," Hokahey white boy, let's go."
894,894, What are we doing?
895,895,"Deputy, you've got no authority."
896,896,You're in violation of Federal law.
897,897,Lower your weapon.
898,898,"Fuck you, you got us in a crossfire!"
899,899,Talk to me! What do I do?
900,900,Hold your ground! County Sheriffs have no authority!
901,901,"All right, everybody just take it easy!"
902,902,FBI! Hey! FBI!
903,903,This is Federal land and I am the only authority! Okay?
904,904,"Right now, all of you stand down!"
905,905,Okay. Everyone!
906,906,We're all working towards the same goal here.
907,907,And I need you to back down and take your hands away from your weapons.
908,908,Look.
909,909,"Dillon, holster your weapon."
910,910,"Fucking decaf, man."
911,911,Jesus fucking Christ.
912,912,"You keep these assholes in check, lady."
913,913,We're just doing our fucking job here.
914,914,"Yeah, when we show up, your job is over, asshole."
915,915,"Evan, holster your weapon now!"
916,916,"All right, everyone of you, step to my left. Let's go."
917,917," Nobody behind me, you understand?"
918,918," You got it, asshole."
919,919,"Guys, step my way."
920,920,"Everybody take a big, deep breath there, please."
921,921,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
922,922,"Deputy, holster your weapon."
923,923,You didn't see it?
924,924,"Now or you're under arrest, you understand me?"
925,925,You didn't see it.
926,926,Take us to Matt's trailer.
927,927,"Yes, ma'am."
928,928,"Ben, copy?"
929,929,"Ben, do you copy?"
930,930,Ben!
931,931,"This is it, right here."
932,932,Does he bunk with anybody?
933,933,Yeah. Me and Pete Mickens.
934,934,Is Pete in there now?
935,935,"Yeah, he's sleeping, he's got the night shift."
936,936,Can I help you?
937,937,"Uh, yeah, I'mI'm looking for my knight in shining armor."
938,938,I think this is his trailer.
939,939,"Well, um, shit, I'm a little short on armor. You know."
940,940," Oh, I don't mind."
941,941, You don't mind? Yeah?
942,942,Do you have any idea how good it is to see you?
943,943,"Like any idea? Man, oh man!"
944,944,How did you get here? I didn't hear your carriage pull up.
945,945,"Well, my uh, carriage wanted to catch the eight o'clock show in Lander."
946,946,"So, she dropped me off at the turnout."
947,947,"What you do, you just walked in the snow, huh?"
948,948,Like Superwoman.
949,949," Well, I think you're worth it."
950,950, You think I'm worth? Yeah?
951,951,Would you get your ass in here.
952,952,Like the baddest woman in the planet. You know that?
953,953,God damn.
954,954,What about New York?
955,955,"Aw, you'd hate New York, you'd hate it."
956,956,Go a whole month there...
957,957,Feet never touch anything but cement.
958,958,"Okay, how about Chicago?"
959,959,"Shit, baby, it's the same thing as New York, it's just colder."
960,960,"You know, more crime, if you're into that kind of thing."
961,961,You think that's funny?
962,962,"All right, how about Los Angeles?"
963,963,"Hey, listen to me, you never, ever say that word around me again."
964,964, It's warm there.
965,965," Yeah, I'd rather be in Iraq."
966,966,Iraq's warm.
967,967," I tell you what, I got one."
968,968, Mmhmm.
969,969,I got one.
970,970,I was uh...
971,971,"I remember I was stationed up at this place called Point Mugu, right."
972,972,It's about an hour north of L.A.
973,973,"It's Christmas, I woke up, I'm all alone, I don't have anybody."
974,974,"But the navy does at Christmas time, they have these dumb little skits in the mess hall, for the guys without families, and I wasn't gonna stick around for that bullshit, so I just..."
975,975,I got in my truck and I hightailed it outta there.
976,976,And I wound up in this little mountain town called Ojai.
977,977,"And I get there, and it's like, it's like fruit farms and vineyards."
978,978,"And there's this mountain surrounding it, you know, like protecting the town."
979,979,"And the people there, like everybody smiles at each other, you know..."
980,980,when they say hello and it's like...
981,981,I remember thinking they were all like they had these looks in their eyes.
982,982,Like they're all in some sorta secret.
983,983,Like they've all figured it out.
984,984,"And there's this mission, this Spanish mission right there in the middle of town."
985,985,They're having Christmas mass.
986,986,Celebrating Christmas in 70 degree weather and I just went.
987,987,"I picked me an orange off a tree and sat down a bench listening to that choir sing, eatin' my orange."
988,988,"And, I don't know, it was the best Christmas I've ever had."
989,989,I wanna live there.
990,990,Okay.
991,991,Let's live in Ojai.
992,992, Okay.
993,993, Yeah.
994,994,What time is it?
995,995,I thought they were staying in town tonight.
996,996,I did too.
997,997,"Shit, I'm sorry Nat."
998,998,Just shut the uh...
999,999,You got drink? You got Vodka?
1000,1000,What do you got? Give it here.
1001,1001,Hand me those. You want one?
1002,1002,Smells like sex in here.
1003,1003,Are you two in there?
1004,1004,We got a fuckin' honeymoon suite?
1005,1005,"What have you two been doing, huh?"
1006,1006,What have they been doing?
1007,1007,Hmm?
1008,1008,"Well, hello there."
1009,1009," Hi, Pete."
1010,1010, Hello.
1011,1011,I'm just kinda wondering what you got under them sheets there.
1012,1012," Hey Curt, mind gettin' him, man?"
1013,1013," Come on, Pete."
1014,1014,"I asked the lady a question, what's she got underneath them sheets?"
1015,1015,"It's a fluffy down coat, Pete."
1016,1016,It's not very sexy.
1017,1017,"Well, fluffy sounds good to me."
1018,1018,"Curt, you gonna get him or not, man?"
1019,1019,"Mattie, wait a second, are you naked too?"
1020,1020,Are you naked too?
1021,1021,What have you two been doing?
1022,1022," Curt, get him out of my room, please."
1023,1023," Come on, Pete."
1024,1024,Are you naked too?
1025,1025,What have you two been doing?
1026,1026,"Hey Curt, would you get him, man?"
1027,1027," Pete, come on!"
1028,1028, I just want one little peek.
1029,1029,"Hey Curt, come in here and get him outta here."
1030,1030,"I don't understand why you won't do that, man."
1031,1031,Little peek! little peek!
1032,1032,I get just a little peek!
1033,1033,What the fuck is your problem?
1034,1034,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
1035,1035,Turn those signals on.

1037,1037,"Now don't you be bullshittin' me, girl."
1038,1038,You been showin' your little ass like a flag around here.
1039,1039,I've been seein' it and all I want's a little...
1040,1040,All I want's a little peek.
1041,1041,"What are you gonna do, big boy?"
1042,1042,"Come on, Pete."
1043,1043,"What you gonna do? come on, What you gonna do, big boy?"
1044,1044,What's that about?
1045,1045," Oh yeah, I can see that."
1046,1046, He don't wanna share.
1047,1047,Friends share.
1048,1048,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
1049,1049,What the fuck!
1050,1050,You're such a fucking pussy over this prairie nigger.
1051,1051,You fuckhead!
1052,1052,Pete!
1053,1053,"Hey, hey!"
1054,1054,Get him away!
1055,1055,Get Mattie!
1056,1056,Get him off him!
1057,1057,Mattie fucking cunt!
1058,1058,Hold him!
1059,1059,"Ain't too proud now, you're my little bitch."
1060,1060,"Wait till it's my turn, you fuckin' bitch."
1061,1061,Go!
1062,1062,Pull him off.
1063,1063,FBI! Open up!
1064,1064,Are you sure someone's in there?
1065,1065," Hey, Pete, it's Curtis."
1066,1066," Ben, copy?"
1067,1067,"FBI's standin' in front of the door, open up."
1068,1068,"Jane, get away from the door!"
1069,1069,"Fuck you, let's go."
1070,1070," Pete, you okay?"
1071,1071, I'm hit!
1072,1072,Who isn't?
1073,1073," Pete, you good?"
1074,1074, We're good.
1075,1075,How many we got down?
1076,1076, Two that won't get up.
1077,1077," No, I'll get up."
1078,1078,"God damn it, the women out here are spunky."
1079,1079,Anyone see where that came from?
1080,1080, Can you stand?
1081,1081, I don't know.
1082,1082,"Well, you better figure it out 'cause we're not done yet."
1083,1083, Where is he?
1084,1084, I don't know.
1085,1085,Curtis!
1086,1086,Mike!
1087,1087," Hey, Curtis!"
1088,1088, Behind trailer three!
1089,1089,You okay?
1090,1090,Let's get you inside.
1091,1091, How bad are you hit?
1092,1092, I don't know.
1093,1093,Looks like a couple of rounds went through here.
1094,1094,But it's just pieces.
1095,1095,You should be okay.
1096,1096,Let's see.
1097,1097,Let's see here.
1098,1098,Okay.
1099,1099, Hold that. Press it tight.
1100,1100, Yeah. Okay.
1101,1101,Give me your radio.
1102,1102,My best chance out of here is a helicopter.
1103,1103,"You don't have one of those, do you?"
1104,1104,Nope.
1105,1105,Give me your radio.
1106,1106,Go get him.
1107,1107,I won't bring him back.
1108,1108,You have to know that.
1109,1109,I do.
1110,1110,Go get him.
1111,1111, Know where you are?
1112,1112, No.
1113,1113,That's Gannet Peak.
1114,1114,Highest mountain in Wyoming.
1115,1115,"On the hottest day in August, should have a foot of snow."
1116,1116,"Today, too cold to snow."
1117,1117,"Look, man, let's just talk for a minute, all right?"
1118,1118,"Let's just talk, please."
1119,1119,Sure.
1120,1120,What the fuck! Where my boots?
1121,1121,Where my boots?
1122,1122,"You know, I got all the time in the world here."
1123,1123,Can't say the same for you.
1124,1124,"So, you gonna talk?"
1125,1125,Or you gonna keep whinin'?
1126,1126,"Look, I ma..."
1127,1127,"I've made mistakes, okay?"
1128,1128,So what'd you do?
1129,1129,"Hey look, I'm not the law here."
1130,1130,I'm just a guy sitting in front of you.
1131,1131,So you can tell me the truth.
1132,1132,"You tell me the truth, I'll give you a chance."
1133,1133,"Ah, you just listen to me!"
1134,1134,You know what it's like out here in this frozen hell!
1135,1135,There's not nothin' to do!
1136,1136,No nothin'! Ain't no women!
1137,1137,No fun!
1138,1138,There's just this fuckin' snow!
1139,1139,And the fuckin' silence! That's all!
1140,1140,My family's people were forced here.
1141,1141,Stuck here for a century.
1142,1142,That snow and silence...
1143,1143,It's the only thing that hasn't been taken from them.
1144,1144,So what'd you take?
1145,1145,I don't know...
1146,1146,I don't know what you mean.
1147,1147,You take something too?
1148,1148,"Hey, I need you to be honest with me, right?"
1149,1149,You get drunk?
1150,1150,Get lonely?
1151,1151,Then what'd you get?
1152,1152,"If you did it, just be a man and say it."
1153,1153,"Say, 'I raped her'."
1154,1154,I raped her.
1155,1155,I raped her! Yeah!
1156,1156,And the boyfriend?
1157,1157,"What, he get in your way, so you beat him to death?"
1158,1158,"Look, a nod's not gonna cut it. Okay?"
1159,1159, I need you to say it.
1160,1160, We beat him.
1161,1161,We made him dead.
1162,1162,Okay.
1163,1163,Please don't.
1164,1164,I'm gonna cut you loose.
1165,1165,You're free to go.
1166,1166,Where? Where am I gonna go?
1167,1167,I'm a man of my word.
1168,1168,"You told the truth, I'm gonna give you a chance."
1169,1169,Gonna give you the same chance that she got.
1170,1170,What chance did she get? What?
1171,1171,What chance did she get?
1172,1172,"If you can make it to that highway, you're a free man."
1173,1173,"Wait, where's... the highway?"
1174,1174,You know how far that drill camp was from where I found Natalie's body?
1175,1175,Six miles.
1176,1176,Barefoot.
1177,1177,That's a warrior.
1178,1178,That's a warrior.
1179,1179,"You, you may make 600 feet."
1180,1180,But you better get going.
1181,1181,I don't understand.
1182,1182,I don't understand.
1183,1183,You do want me to do?
1184,1184,I want you to run.
1185,1185,Far from your loving eyes.
1186,1186,In a place where winter never comes.
1187,1187,Far from your loving eyes.
1188,1188,Alone among the wind I run.
1189,1189,Far from your loving eyes.
1190,1190,Alone among the wind I run.
1191,1191,I return to this place.
1192,1192,And close my eyes again.
1193,1193,How you feeling?
1194,1194,I feel okay.
1195,1195,I got you something.
1196,1196,I thought maybe it'll give you a little taste of home.
1197,1197, Little crocodile.
1198,1198, Please don't make me laugh.
1199,1199,It's an alligator.
1200,1200,He'll protect you.
1201,1201,"Better than that bulletproof vest, right?"
1202,1202,"I shouldn't joke about that, it saved your life."
1203,1203,You saved my life.
1204,1204,No.
1205,1205,"Jane, you're a tough woman."
1206,1206,You saved your own life.
1207,1207,We should both be honest.
1208,1208,I just...
1209,1209,I got lucky.
1210,1210,"Well, you know luck don't live out here."
1211,1211,Luck lives in the city.
1212,1212,It don't live out here.
1213,1213,It lives wherever you get hit by a bus or not.
1214,1214,Whether your bank is robbed or not.
1215,1215,Whether someone's damned cellphone when they come up to a crosswalk.
1216,1216,That's luck.
1217,1217,That's winning or losing.
1218,1218,"Out here, you survive or you surrender."
1219,1219,Period.
1220,1220,That's determined by your strength.
1221,1221,And by your spirit.
1222,1222,Wolves don't kill unlucky deer.
1223,1223,They kill the weak ones.
1224,1224,"You fought for your life, Jane."
1225,1225,And now you get to walk away with it.
1226,1226,You get to go home.
1227,1227,I know what you're doing.
1228,1228,I'm gonna read to you from a magazine.
1229,1229,"""Ten signs that he is into you."" Things that I really wanna know."
1230,1230,"""He looks you in the eye when he speaks."" Ain't this supposed to be cute?"
1231,1231,She ran six miles in the snow.
1232,1232,"Yeah, she did."
1233,1233,Hello?
1234,1234,Martin?
1235,1235,Martin!
1236,1236,Hey.
1237,1237,Martin?
1238,1238,Annie?
1239,1239,Hey.
1240,1240,What's with the paint?
1241,1241,It's my death face.
1242,1242,Is that right?
1243,1243,And how would you know what that is?
1244,1244,I don't.
1245,1245,Just made it up.
1246,1246,There's no one left to teach me.
1247,1247,I was ready to quit.
1248,1248,Then the phone rang.
1249,1249,Which is never good.
1250,1250,But today it was.
1251,1251,First time Chip's called me in over a year.
1252,1252,Where is he?
1253,1253,The station.
1254,1254,Was gonna go pick him up.
1255,1255,Soon as I washed this shit off my face.
1256,1256,I heard about what happened.
1257,1257,I heard there's one still missing.
1258,1258,No.
1259,1259,No one's missing.
1260,1260,How'd he go out?
1261,1261,With a whimper.
1262,1262,You gotta go easy on Chip.
1263,1263,Suffering's hard on you when you don't got the practice.
1264,1264,I should go get him.
1265,1265,Just need to sit here.
1266,1266,Just for a minute.
1267,1267,Got time to sit with me?
1268,1268,I ain't goin' nowhere.
