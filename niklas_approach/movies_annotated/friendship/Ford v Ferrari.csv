0,0,"This is live coverage of the 1959 We've reached the halfway point and so far witnessed Aston Martin number 5, driven by Carroll Shelby, making great gains in the last hour."
1,1,"If he keeps this pace up, he could have a chance at the..."
2,2,He's coming in.
3,3,He's coming in.
4,4,"Let's go, let's go."
5,5, Tires!
6,6," Let's go, let's go."
7,7,"I know you're tired, but come on, let's make this fast."
8,8,"Move, move, move!"
9,9,"She's running a little hot, but we're good."
10,10,Tires are still gripping.
11,11,Fire! The fuel! Fire!
12,12," Shelby, it's you!"
13,13, Grab that blanket!
14,14,Get off me! Off!
15,15,You okay?
16,16,Fill the tank!
17,17," Shelby, you just..."
18,18, Am I on fire?
19,19,Am I on goddamn fire?
20,20," No, you're not on fire."
21,21, Fill the damn tank!
22,22, Fill the tank.
23,23, Fill the tank.
24,24,Get it ready!
25,25," Where am I, Eddie?"
26,26," Two laps up, my friend."
27,27,Car's yours.
28,28,Go get 'em.
29,29,"Aston Martin number 5, driven by Carroll Shelby, has maintained his lead as we're nearing the final minutes of the race."
30,30,Shelby.
31,31,The checkered flag is out.
32,32,The crowd are on their feet.
33,33,Shelby.
34,34,...takes the title!
35,35,An American wins Le Mans.
36,36,Shelby.
37,37,Carroll Shelby.
38,38,What?
39,39,This is something you can't ignore anymore.
40,40,"Oh, I take the pills."
41,41,The pills work.
42,42,"An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM, sustained even for a short period, you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest."
43,43, I'll race shorter format then.
44,44, That's not gonna work.
45,45,"Well, I could race NASCAR."
46,46,Formula One.
47,47,"The valve is shot, Shelby."
48,48,This is as serious as it gets.
49,49,"In my opinion, you're lucky to be sitting here today."
50,50,"Well, I feel real lucky."
51,51,Luckiest guy on earth.
52,52,"There's a point at 7,000 RPM where everything fades."
53,53,The machine becomes weightless.
54,54,Just disappears.
55,55,Hey!
56,56,"Watch it, buddy!"
57,57,And all that's left is a body moving through space and time.
58,58,"7,000 RPM."
59,59,That's where you meet it.
60,60,It asks you a question.
61,61,The only question that matters.
62,62,"""Who are you?"" Now, it's von Trips in the Ferrari, coming into the corkscrew."
63,63,He's braking late.
64,64,"Hey, I called you three times, and you never answer the phone."
65,65,Oh! He sets a new lap record!
66,66,I answer the phone every time it rings.
67,67," No, sir, you do not."
68,68," Yes, I do."
69,69,"No, you don't."
70,70,"A month ago, this car was fun."
71,71,"Now, it won't even start."
72,72,"And when it does, it's, ""Boom, boom, boom!"" When I pull out of the driveway, the dog has a heart attack."
73,73,All I'm asking is for you to make it like it was.
74,74,"Yeah, you've coked up the inlet valves and the plugs."
75,75,"Nothing wrong with the car, just the way it's being driven."
76,76,The way it's being driven?
77,77,"Too much fuel, not enough spark."
78,78,That's what's making her misfire.
79,79,You wanna run that by me in English?
80,80,"All right, sir."
81,81,So...
82,82,"that there, that is a sport car."
83,83,You have to drive her like a sport car.
84,84,"If you drive her like a school teacher, she'll clog up. All right?"
85,85,"Try changing up at 5,000 RPM, not two."
86,86,Drive like you mean it.
87,87,Hard and tight.
88,88,She'll run clean.
89,89,Are you telling me I don't know how to drive my own car?
90,90,No.
91,91,"But if you ask me, this isn't your car."
92,92,Your car's more a Plymouth or a Studebaker.
93,93,"You and me have a problem, buddy?"
94,94,I don't have a problem.
95,95,I had an MG.
96,96,Mine ran just fine.
97,97,"Screw you, you limey prick."
98,98,I want my money back.
99,99,"Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya."
100,100,But you haven't paid for last month's service yet.
101,101,"This country, the customer's always right."
102,102,You ever hear that?
103,103,Yeah. Yeah.
104,104,Utter nonsense.
105,105,"Now remember, I advanced the timing, so a smidge twitchy in first."
106,106,Get the revs up.
107,107,Good lad. Revs up.
108,108,Tara.
109,109,Another satisfied customer?
110,110,"Can I help you, miss?"
111,111,Wasn't that an MGA 1500?
112,112,"Ah, you know your cars."
113,113,"Well, I like them."
114,114,I love the sound they make.
115,115,The way it goes right through you.
116,116,Right.
117,117,That vibration.
118,118,Mine's the woodpaneled Country Squire...
119,119,across the street.
120,120,A real hot rod.
121,121,"Oh, yeah?"
122,122, Is it fast?
123,123, Very.
124,124,Wait a second.
125,125,What type of girl are ya?
126,126,Type of girl who likes the smell of wet gasoline.
127,127, Oh.
128,128, Burnt rubber.
129,129,"Oh, what, are you some kind of a deviant, are ya?"
130,130,"Well, only since I married you."
131,131,"Hey, Gar, what's going on?"
132,132,Something's up.
133,133,"Hi, Lee."
134,134,"Listen, he isn't as sure as you are about the banks."
135,135,I'm not as sure about this...
136,136,How's this going out?
137,137," Don, what's going on?"
138,138, I don't know.
139,139,"Mr. Ford, welcome to the room."
140,140,"Good afternoon, Mr. Ford."
141,141,"Nice to see you, sir."
142,142,"Shut it down, Mr. Beebe."
143,143,John!
144,144,All stop.
145,145,Hear that?
146,146,That's the sound of the Ford Motor Company...
147,147,out of business.
148,148,"In 1899, my grandfather, Henry, by God, Ford..."
149,149,was walking home from Edison Illumination after working a double shift.
150,150,He was ruminating.
151,151,"That morning, he had himself an idea that changed the world."
152,152,"Sixtyfive years and 47 million automobiles later, what shall be his legacy?"
153,153,Getting it in the tail pipe from a Chevy Impala.
154,154,Here's what I want you to do.
155,155,Walk home.
156,156,"While you're walking, I want you to ruminate."
157,157,"Man comes to my office with an idea, that man keeps his job."
158,158,Rest of you secondbest losers...
159,159,stay home.
160,160,You don't belong at Ford.
161,161,Shelby!
162,162,I see you.
163,163,"Up and at 'em, buddy."
164,164, Hey!
165,165, Go away.
166,166,Come on. You can do it.
167,167,"Come on, baby."
168,168,Let's go.
169,169," Let's go. Let's go, go, go."
170,170, Go away.
171,171,"It's 8:30 a.m., baby."
172,172,Time to roll.
173,173,Come on.
174,174,"Hey, Phil."
175,175,"Hey, Bob."
176,176,Is Shelby here?
177,177,"Uh, it's touch and go."
178,178,"Shelby, you're up bright and early."
179,179,"Well, early bird gets the worm, Pops."
180,180,"All right, who you worried about?"
181,181,"Well, you got Red Faris and Bill Rushton."
182,182,They're all in 327s.
183,183,Corvettes.
184,184,What about Bondurant?
185,185,"Bondurant? Well, he's still driving..."
186,186," Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?"
187,187, ...for Washburn.
188,188,Number 614.
189,189, Thank you so much.
190,190," All right, just relax. All right."
191,191,We're gonna eat those Vettes for breakfast.
192,192,"We're lighter, we're faster, and that don't work, we're nastier."
193,193,"Hey, Dad, before the race starts, take your son over to the Willow Springs..."
194,194,"Hey, Phil. Hey, take it easy on us today, bud."
195,195,You all right?
196,196,"Paragraph 15.4, section 2b of the SCCA standard dictates all AF class cars must have minimum trunk space of 20 inches by 12 inches by six inches."
197,197,Your trunk doesn't close.
198,198, Ergo car fails standard.
199,199," Wait, wait, wait. What?"
200,200,Ergo car is disqualified from said Class A competition.
201,201,"No, no, no. Look, look, look."
202,202,"Can I ask you a question, all right?"
203,203,"When you were a little boy, did you think, ""When I grow up, I want to go ""to the fabled Willow Springs Raceway, ""and I want to enforce paragraph 15.4, section 2b ""of the SCCA regulations on luggage capacity""?"
204,204," All right, that's it."
205,205, Did you?
206,206,I'm ruling you and your team disqualified from this race.
207,207,"Ah, well, if it isn't Lance Reventlow."
208,208," Ah, Shelby."
209,209," How you doing, Lance?"
210,210, Pops.
211,211," Hey, Lance."
212,212,Allow me to introduce Dieter Voss.
213,213,Runs Brumos Porsche out of Jacksonville.
214,214,"Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss."
215,215,"You're having a hell of a season with that Abarth, sir."
216,216,"Seeing results for your Cobra, too."
217,217, Thank you.
218,218, Your guy Miles is impressive.
219,219," Oh, you following Miles?"
220,220," Oh, yes."
221,221,"Well, he was a USAC road racing champ in '61."
222,222,He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.
223,223,He was SCCA Cclass champion three years in a row in this pieceofshit MG he built himself.
224,224,"We heard he's, uh, difficult."
225,225,"What, Ken? No, no."
226,226,Ken's a puppy dog.
227,227,"Hey, Lance, tell the man."
228,228,You've raced against Ken.
229,229,"Oh, I've driven more behind him than against him."
230,230,"Well, Brumos is looking for a driver for our number two car at Sebring."
231,231, Is that right?
232,232, How is that even possible?
233,233,Think your guy Miles can make the grade?
234,234," Oh, well, Ken..."
235,235," Is he, mate? Hey!"
236,236,Jim! Is he putting his bloody carryall  in your trunk?
237,237, What?
238,238,Discretionary infraction.
239,239,"Gentlemen, excuse me a moment."
240,240,"To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring."
241,241,Nothing in there about my trunk and your lovely little portmanteau.
242,242,You're holding the '62 edition of the SCCA.
243,243,And you can stick this bloody sticker where the sun don't shine.
244,244,"Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems to be the problem, Bill?"
245,245,The problem is that Bill here is an arsehole.
246,246," No, he doesn't mean that."
247,247," Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does."
248,248,"No, he really does think that Bill is an arsehole."
249,249, I'm just doing my job here.
250,250," Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill."
251,251,"In my experience, there is..."
252,252,Listen to me.
253,253,"Something like this, there's always a middle ground."
254,254,All right?
255,255,"Now, Ken's outta line."
256,256,And I'm just doing my job.
257,257,I understand you are.
258,258,You know how he gets on a race day.
259,259,You know that. All right?
260,260,But you're not gonna DQ us over a trunk.
261,261, What?
262,262, You see that guy?
263,263,Got his tail up.
264,264,"Happy, Bill?"
265,265,"Bill, I'll handle it."
266,266,I'll talk to him.
267,267,I'll talk to him. You just go and have a great day.
268,268,"Hey, folks, feeling hungry?"
269,269,Head on over to the snack bar...
270,270,Shit.
271,271, Bulldog.
272,272, Huh?
273,273,You know who that was I was just talking to?
274,274,Bill.
275,275, Before that.
276,276, No.
277,277,It was Dieter Voss.
278,278,Who's that?
279,279,"He runs Porsche, Ken."
280,280,It's a little German car company.
281,281,Maybe you heard of it.
282,282,All right.
283,283,He wanted you to drive at Sebring.
284,284,But he'd heard you were difficult.
285,285,"I thought we felt the same way about, uh, Germans."
286,286,"Do you like losing, Ken?"
287,287,Excuse me?
288,288,"Oh, you heard me."
289,289,I don't lose.
290,290,"Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken."
291,291,"And last I checked, the professionals  all have a car."
292,292, Shel!
293,293,You cannot win the SCCA without one.
294,294,"If you're not winning, you are losing."
295,295,Don't make me lamp this at your head.
296,296,Did you bring your son all the way out here to watch you get disqualified or just act like a jackass?
297,297,Damn!
298,298,"Well, that answers that."
299,299,Peter...
300,300,"May I help you, gentlemen?"
301,301,"Uh, yes, is Ken Miles here?"
302,302,No.
303,303,We need to speak to Mr. Miles.
304,304,I'm his wife.
305,305,Welcome to the 1963 Willow Springs 100.
306,306,Twelve cars will be competing in this 40lap race.
307,307,"Hey, Ken, what happened to your shield?"
308,308,New design.
309,309,"Well, it looks like we're about to begin."
310,310,The cars have completed their warmup lap.
311,311,The green flag is out...
312,312,and they're approaching the starting line.
313,313,Here we go.
314,314,"Oh, bloody hell."
315,315,Ken Miles has fallen behind.
316,316,"Learn to drive, you pillock!"
317,317,"So, Shelby, do you miss it?"
318,318,"Hey, Sam."
319,319,"Guy wins the 24hour Le Mans, suddenly retires, starts selling cars."
320,320,It just don't make sense.
321,321,"Well, unless the rumors are true, of course."
322,322,"Oh, what rumors would those be, Sam?"
323,323,That Carroll Shelby quit driving 'cause he lost his nerve.
324,324,"I'm gonna outbrake you on the next turn, Bob."
325,325,"Haha! Nice try, Bob."
326,326,Nice move from Ken Miles.
327,327,"Twentytwo laps remaining, with Phil Hill and Dan Gurney in the lead."
328,328,"It's been an incredible day here at Willow Springs, and we've seen some exciting driving."
329,329,"With just one lap remaining in this 40lap race, we're coming to the final stretch."
330,330,Dan Gurney has been leading the pack for most of the...
331,331,Whoa!
332,332,"Number 18, Red Faris, is off the track."
333,333,That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead followed by journeyman Ken Miles.
334,334,"Now for you, Dan."
335,335,And they're coming around the last turn.
336,336,Gurney is still in the lead with Ken Miles hot on his heels.
337,337,Miles is looking for an opening.
338,338,Not yet.
339,339,Come on.
340,340,Can Gurney hold him off in the final straight?
341,341,Not yet.
342,342,Gurney is blocking him out.
343,343,Now.
344,344,Miles goes for the shoulder.
345,345,"Nice move, Ken."
346,346,They're wheel to wheel.
347,347,Come on.
348,348,It's Corvette versus Cobra for the finish.
349,349,Yeah! Haha!
350,350,Yeah!
351,351,An incredible finish for Ken Miles.
352,352,Didn't see that one coming.
353,353,He's difficult but good.
354,354,Let's give everyone a hand for one heck of a race.
355,355,That calls for a nice cup of tea.
356,356,I'll put the kettle on.
357,357,Hop in.
358,358,"I'm HAPPY I'm HAPPY I know I am, I'm sure I am I'm HAPPY Pops, frame this."
359,359,Hey.
360,360,We did it.
361,361,What's wrong?
362,362,The IRS came.
363,363,They've padlocked the garage.
364,364,"All right, Petey."
365,365,A couple of years ago...
366,366,you said we'd a nest egg.
367,367,Correct.
368,368,A couple of years ago.
369,369,Correct.
370,370,"So just to be clear, we are buggered."
371,371,Absolutely.
372,372,As in totally?
373,373,"As in, not a bean, or a pot in which to piss."
374,374,"Spares, stock, all gone."
375,375,Tools. My tools are locked up in there.
376,376,I'll figure something out.
377,377,In 1945...
378,378,our soldiers came home.
379,379,What was the first thing that they did?
380,380,They had sex.
381,381,"Seventeen years later, those babies, they've grown."
382,382,And they've got jobs.
383,383,They've got licenses.
384,384,But they do not wanna drive the same dull 50s cars that their parents drove.
385,385,"You see, kids today, they want glamour."
386,386,They want sex appeal.
387,387,They want to go fast.
388,388,Gentlemen...
389,389,it's time for the Ford Motor Company to go racing.
390,390,"We're already in racing, Iacocca."
391,391,NASCAR?
392,392,"It's... it's regional, sir."
393,393,"If you go to the movies, you open up a magazine, you don't see good ol' boys from WinstonSalem."
394,394,"You see, uh..."
395,395,Sophia Loren...
396,396,Monica Vitti.
397,397,"James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir."
398,398,That's because he's a degenerate.
399,399,See?
400,400,"God, I'd like to be a degenerate."
401,401,"Um, just give me one second here, sir."
402,402,Is this part of it?
403,403,"Is this going anywhere, Iacocca?"
404,404,"Just a second, sir."
405,405,"All right, all right, that's enough."
406,406,"Sir, if you just bear with me..."
407,407,Turn it off. Lights.
408,408,"Lee, in the last three years, you and your marketing team..."
409,409,have presided over the worst sales slump in US history.
410,410,Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?
411,411,Because we've been thinking wrong.
412,412,Ferrari.
413,413,"Now, they have won four out of the last five Le Mans."
414,414,We need to think like Ferrari.
415,415,Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year than we make in a day.
416,416,We spend more on toilet paper than they do on their entire output.
417,417,You want us to think like them?
418,418,Enzo Ferrari will go down in history as the greatest car manufacturer of all time.
419,419,Why?
420,420,Is it because he built the most cars?
421,421,No.
422,422,It's because of what his cars mean.
423,423,Victory.
424,424,Ferrari wins at Le Mans.
425,425,"People, they, they want some of that victory."
426,426,What if the Ford badge meant victory?
427,427,"And meant it where it counts, with the first group of 17yearolds in history with money in their pockets?"
428,428,This would take years.
429,429,Decades to test and develop...
430,430,a race team capable of taking out Ferrari.
431,431,Ferrari's bankrupt.
432,432,"Enzo has spent every lira he's got chasing perfection, and you know something?"
433,433,He got there.
434,434,But now he's broke.
435,435,"You don't have to give up racing to get a bloody day job, Ken."
436,436,I think I do.
437,437,"Now, I've had my fun."
438,438,It's time to put food on the table...
439,439,and grow up.
440,440,The garage didn't pay the bills.
441,441,Now it's locked up.
442,442,"Racing doesn't pay them either, and I keep winning."
443,443,"Yeah, because you're good."
444,444,But I can't play the game.
445,445,I'm not what they call a people person.
446,446, You don't say.
447,447, And I'm 45 years old.
448,448,Do you really think I'm gonna change?
449,449,I'm never gonna get the good rise.
450,450,I started too late.
451,451,Because you fought in the bloody war.
452,452,"If you stop, you'll be bloody insufferable."
453,453,Let's quit going round the Wrekin. It's over.
454,454,Let's look on the bright side.
455,455,"Now I can get fat and old, trim the roses, and eat pork pies."
456,456,"Uh, scusa."
457,457,"Please, no photos."
458,458,Prego.
459,459," Relax, will you?"
460,460, You gotta understand.
461,461,This is like the Mafia showing up to buy the Statue of Liberty.
462,462,"Kind of the opposite, actually."
463,463,"The press gets wind of this, the shit will hit the Fangio."
464,464,"Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor."
465,465,"Franco Gozzi, Ferrari."
466,466,Journalists?
467,467,"No, no, Mr. Iacocca, no."
468,468,It's our cameras.
469,469,Just for history.
470,470,Fourliter Colombo engine.
471,471,One man assembles the entire engine by himself.
472,472,Another man assembles the transmission.
473,473,Everything handbuilt.
474,474,Bellissimo.
475,475,Racing Department.
476,476,Lee.
477,477,That's him.
478,478,This merger between our companies will form two entities.
479,479,"FordFerrari, who controls all production."
480,480,"Secondly, FerrariFord, the race team, In order to secure this, Ford will pay the sum..."
481,481,Excuse me.
482,482,He will need some time to read this.
483,483,Ah. Please.
484,484,"Ah. Yeah, of course."
485,485,I'm looking for the chairman of Fiat!
486,486,Agnelli!
487,487,I have photographs for you to see.
488,488,Pronto.
489,489,Pronto.
490,490,"Yes, I am here."
491,491,Do you have something to say?
492,492,Enzo maintains full control.
493,493,I get the company for 18 million.
494,494,"All done, thank you."
495,495,"""Gentlemen, ""only one small question."
496,496,"It concerns my race program."" ""If I wish to race Le Mans, ""and you do not wish for me to race Le Mans..."
497,497,"""do we or do we not go?"" Look, in that highly unlikely scenario..."
498,498,if we just can't agree...
499,499,"then, yes."
500,500,"I mean, no."
501,501,You are correct.
502,502,You do not go.
503,503,"""My integrity as a constructor, ""as a man, as an Italian, ""is deeply insulted by your proposal."" ""Go back to Michigan."" ""Back to your big, ugly factory."" ""Back to your big, ugly factory, ""making its ugly, little cars."" ""Tell your pigheaded boss that ""all his, uh, smug executives are worthless sons of whores."" Tell him he's not Henry Ford."
504,504,He's Henry Ford II.
505,505,I'm starving. Let's go eat.
506,506,He played us.
507,507,Old Man Enzo had no intention of selling to us.
508,508,He used us to up his price...
509,509,embarrass our company and insult your leadership.
510,510,It was a bad idea from the start.
511,511,What exactly did he say?
512,512,"He said Ford makes ugly little cars, and we make 'em..."
513,513,in an ugly factory.
514,514,He said our executives are sons of whores.
515,515,About me?
516,516,"He called you fat, sir."
517,517,Pigheaded.
518,518,Go on.
519,519,He said you're not Henry Ford.
520,520,You're Henry Ford II.
521,521,I want the best engineers.
522,522,The best drivers.
523,523,I don't care what it costs.
524,524,We're gonna build a race car.
525,525,And we're gonna bury that goddamn greasy wop under the finish line at Le Mans.
526,526,And I will be there to watch it.
527,527,Here they come.
528,528,"Go, go, go, go."
529,529,Assholes.
530,530,You're really pathetic.
531,531,"I'm so sorry, girls."
532,532,Charlie!
533,533,Quit throwing crackers at the girls all damn day.
534,534,God damn it.
535,535,Do I gotta deal with this?
536,536,It's already taken care of.
537,537,Sorry about that.
538,538,"So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8."
539,539,Far out.
540,540,Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end.
541,541,And a stronger rear diff to handle the torque.
542,542,How's she handle a quarter mile?
543,543,"Well, now, I'm not saying you should go drag racing, but a quarter mile's 13.6."
544,544,Yeah.
545,545, Is that good?
546,546," Oh, that's real good."
547,547,He sold that same car three times this week.
548,548, You take cash? Is cash okay?
549,549, Cash is okay.
550,550,"Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself one hell of a sport car."
551,551,All right.
552,552,"Tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil!"
553,553,I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague here.
554,554,He gonna take care of you.
555,555," Phil, Wyatt."
556,556," Hello, Wyatt."
557,557,I'm gonna steal him for one second.
558,558,You take the payment.
559,559,"Whatever you do, do not let him take that car."
560,560,That's Jeff Blitzer's car.
561,561,And Frank Collins' and Steve McQueen's.
562,562,Shit. I forgot about McQueen.
563,563,Morning.
564,564,Can I help you?
565,565,Carroll Shelby?
566,566,Maybe.
567,567,"Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor."
568,568,What's with the wrench?
569,569,"That? Oh, long story."
570,570,"We are just going from strength to strength here, Lee."
571,571,"Terrific sales, we're killing it on the track."
572,572,"Now, I know I owe Ford for that last batch of engines..."
573,573,"Mr. Shelby, I can assure you I'm not here for money that you might owe Ford for spare parts."
574,574,You're not?
575,575,"No, I'm not."
576,576,Okay.
577,577,"I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford II."
578,578,"Suppose, um, hypothetically, that he wanted his company to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans."
579,579,You're one of the only Americans that's ever done it...
580,580,so I'm wondering...
581,581,what's it take?
582,582,Hypothetically?
583,583,Hypothetically.
584,584,It takes something money can't buy.
585,585,Money can buy speed.
586,586,"But it isn't about speed, Lee."
587,587,It's not just like those other tracks where all you do is turn to the left for four hours.
588,588,"To win that race, you need a car that's light enough to do 200 on the straightaways but strong enough to keep that up for 3,000 miles without a break."
589,589,"Not just the best car y'all have ever made, but better than anything that Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year."
590,590,And that just gets you to the green flag.
591,591,That's where your problems really start.
592,592,Is everything okay?
593,593,Go away.
594,594,So you're saying it's challenging.
595,595,"Look, it's not even a track, Lee."
596,596,Le Mans is eight and a half miles of country road.
597,597,"It's narrow, ungraded, it's rough."
598,598,"There's no camber on the turns, no rails."
599,599,You gotta do that for 24 hours.
600,600,"Twentyfour hours, Lee."
601,601,That means night.
602,602,Half that race is in the dark.
603,603,You can't see shit.
604,604,Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.
605,605,"Drivers stumbling around the track, pouring blood."
606,606,Maybe one of 'em is your friend. Maybe...
607,607,Maybe he's on fire.
608,608,"You're exhausted, you're hungry..."
609,609,"can't remember your name, what country you're in."
610,610,"And all of a sudden, you realize you're doing 198 on a straight."
611,611,And if anything goes wrong...
612,612,"you blow a gasket, a fivecent washer..."
613,613,"that's it, whole thing's over."
614,614,Ferrari wins again.
615,615,Just like he won last year and the year before that.
616,616,And the year before that.
617,617,Yeah.
618,618,It's challenging.
619,619,So you don't think...
620,620,that Ford Motor Company can build the greatest race car the world's ever seen?
621,621,You think that we are incapable of winning an event like that?
622,622,Even if we had a brilliant partner?
623,623,"Even if we wrote a, uh, blank check?"
624,624,"What I'm saying is, you can't buy a win, Lee."
625,625,But maybe you could buy the guy who gets you a shot.
626,626,"A new transmission, axles, shocks all around, ditch the body and the tires, you have yourself a contender."
627,627,Anything on this beauty that does work?
628,628,The mirrors are outstanding.
629,629,I saw that walking up.
630,630,"So, what, you just passing on an evening stroll?"
631,631,"Actually, Bulldog, I have a proposition for you."
632,632,You're gonna build a car to beat Old Man Ferrari...
633,633, Yeah.
634,634, ...with Ford?
635,635,With a Ford?
636,636,Correct.
637,637,And how long did you tell them that you needed?
638,638,"Two, three hundred years?"
639,639,Ninety days.
640,640,"All right, so let's just look at this for a moment."
641,641,"And for argument's sake, let's just forget about the whole 90day thing."
642,642,So let's just pretend you've got all the money in the world and all the time in the world.
643,643, I like the sound of that.
644,644, All right.
645,645,So...
646,646,you think that Ford are gonna let you build the car that you want...
647,647,the way you want it?
648,648,The Ford Motor Company?
649,649,Those guys?
650,650,Have you ever been to Detroit?
651,651,"They have floors and floors of lawyers and millions of marketing guys, and they're all gonna want to meet you."
652,652,"They're gonna want to get their photo taken with the great Carroll Shelby, and they're gonna kiss your ass and go back to their lovely offices..."
653,653,and they're gonna work out new ways to screw you.
654,654,Why? Because they can't help it.
655,655,Because they just want to please their boss who wants please his boss who wants to please his boss.
656,656,And they hate themselves for it.
657,657,But deep down...
658,658,"who they hate even more are guys like you, because you're not like them, because you don't think like them, because you're different."
659,659,It's coming straight from the Deuce.
660,660,He's serious.
661,661,They're gonna put real money behind it.
662,662,I'll bet they are.
663,663,You know why?
664,664,"Because someone, and I'm not saying who, someone has told them that this is actually possible."
665,665,Look...
666,666,"this Sunday at Cloverfield, they're launching the new Mustang."
667,667,They're gonna announce the race program.
668,668,Just come on by.
669,669,Come take a look.
670,670,Listen to my speech.
671,671,I'm making a speech.
672,672,Bring Peter. He'll love it.
673,673,"All right, Shel."
674,674,See you Sunday.
675,675,Whoa.
676,676,"Dad, look at that."
677,677,Huh.
678,678,The Ford Mustang.
679,679,What do you think?
680,680,I think it's a secretary's car.
681,681,I like it.
682,682,Oh.
683,683,Excu... Excuse me.
684,684,"Would you, would you not do that?"
685,685,Oh. Sorry.
686,686,"Oh, er, is this, is this your son?"
687,687,"Yes, it is."
688,688,Would you ask him to keep his hands off the paintwork?
689,689,"No, no, no, Peter."
690,690,You're okay.
691,691,Who are you?
692,692,"Leo Beebe, senior executive vice president, Ford Motor Company."
693,693,Ah.
694,694,I'm responsible for the launch of the Mustang.
695,695,Ah! At least now we know who's responsible.
696,696,"Don't get me wrong, Lenny."
697,697, Leo.
698,698, It looks fantastic.
699,699,"But inside, it's a lump of lard dressed up to fool the public."
700,700,"My advice is, lose the inlinesix and that idiotic threespeed, shorten the wheelbase, somehow lose half a ton, and lower the price."
701,701,Dad.
702,702,"But even then, I'd still choose a Chevy Chevelle."
703,703,And that's a fucking terrible car.
704,704,"How are we doing up there, Steve?"
705,705,"There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby."
706,706,"Oh, yeah."
707,707,You mind if I take a shot at the landing?
708,708,Uh...
709,709,"No, no, no. I mean it."
710,710,I flew B29s out of San Antone in '44.
711,711,You're kidding.
712,712, I did.
713,713, Okay.
714,714,"Carroll, what are you doing?"
715,715, Does he know how to fly?
716,716, Carroll.
717,717,"I had an instructor tell me, he said..."
718,718,"Don, I would say it's probably a good time to buckle up."
719,719,"""...do everybody a favor, stay on the ground."" That's a true story."
720,720," Oh, no."
721,721," Oh, shit."
722,722, God damn it.
723,723, Here we go.
724,724,This is the car you never expected from Detroit.
725,725,All right. Let's go.
726,726,"Not staying, Ken?"
727,727,"Ah, it's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it?"
728,728,"Oh, here they come now."
729,729, Wait. Are they crashing?
730,730," Oh, Lord."
731,731,Who's the pilot?
732,732,"My guess, Peter..."
733,733,it's someone we know.
734,734,Everything all right up there?
735,735,"Oh, no."
736,736, No!
737,737, Hang on.
738,738,"Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit."
739,739,Shit. Shit. Shit.
740,740,"Tell you what, that's like riding a bike."
741,741,Talk about making an entrance.
742,742, Shelby...
743,743, Good grief.
744,744, Shelby!
745,745, All right!
746,746, Over here. Over here!
747,747, Shelby!
748,748,How y'all doing?
749,749,"Can I get your autograph, please?"
750,750,"Can I get your autograph, sir?"
751,751,"Carroll, this is Roy Lunn."
752,752,Old Roy here is developing the prototype over in England.
753,753,"Oh, hell, I know Roy."
754,754,"Good to see you, Roy."
755,755,"Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby."
756,756,Ford wheeled out the entire executive committee for this one.
757,757,Hold that thought.
758,758,Ah.
759,759,"Hello, Mr. Lindbergh."
760,760,You like that?
761,761,"Hey, Peter, how you doing?"
762,762, Mr. Shelby.
763,763, Good to see you.
764,764,Are you building a car that's gonna beat Ferrari?
765,765,"Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans, that's for sure."
766,766,"And if we get across that finish line first, we're gonna win."
767,767,"Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe, senior vice president, Ford Motor."
768,768,"Oh, sure. Yeah."
769,769,"A pleasure, Mr. Beebe."
770,770, Thank you for coming.
771,771," Say hello to Ken Miles  and his son, Peter."
772,772, Yeah.
773,773," We've, um... we met."
774,774," We, uh... we met."
775,775,Yeah.
776,776,Didn't we?
777,777,"So, um, well..."
778,778,I'll take Petey for some pop.
779,779,"Good luck with these guys, Shel."
780,780," Bye, Mr. Shelby."
781,781," See you, Pete."
782,782,"Don't worry, he's gonna stay."
783,783,"So, you two get a chance to talk on the plane?"
784,784,Yeah. Uh...
785,785,"Carroll, why don't we just step this way for a second?"
786,786,"Look, it's pro forma."
787,787,It's window dressing.
788,788,But there's gotta be a sense of giveandtake between you and...
789,789,you know.
790,790,"No, I don't."
791,791,The group.
792,792,The group?
793,793,"Senior creatives, Carroll."
794,794,Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.
795,795,"Well, I'm confused, Lee."
796,796,"'Cause up until this moment, right now, I was comfortable."
797,797,"You should take a look out there, Carroll. Hmm?"
798,798,What do you see?
799,799,You know what I see?
800,800,I see a machine.
801,801,"I see 10,000 moving parts, moving hopefully in harmony, and it's my job to make it so."
802,802,It's my job to guide you through it.
803,803,"I am here to help you, Carroll."
804,804,But you gotta trust me.
805,805," Excuse me, Lee."
806,806, Carroll...
807,807,do not step on that stage if you don't trust me.
808,808,Please welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.
809,809,Gotta go.
810,810,Shelby... Oh.
811,811,Shelby.
812,812,What'd he say?
813,813,He gets the drill.
814,814,Thank you.
815,815,"Well, if my daddy was here today..."
816,816,he'd tell me to sit on down and leave the yakking to the college boys...
817,817,"so, like my cars, I'll make this fast."
818,818,"When I was 10 years old, Pops said to me, ""Son..."
819,819,"""it's a truly lucky man ""who knows what he wants to do in this world."
820,820,"""'Cause that man will never work a day in his life."" But there are a few, a precious few, and, hell, I don't know if they're lucky or not."
821,821,But there are a few people who find something they have to do.
822,822,Something obsesses 'em.
823,823,"Something that if they can't do it, it's gonna drive them clean out of their mind."
824,824,I'm that guy.
825,825,And I know one other man feels exactly the same.
826,826,His name...
827,827,His name is Mr. Henry Ford.
828,828,Yeah! Whoo!
829,829,"And together, we're gonna build the fastest automobiles in the world."
830,830,"And we're gonna make history, too, at Le Mans."
831,831, Let's go.
832,832, What?
833,833,My name is Carroll Shelby.
834,834,I build race cars.
835,835,"No. Whatever it is, no."
836,836,No.
837,837,Thirty minutes.
838,838,"Ah, just... I'm spent."
839,839, I wanna have a bath.
840,840, You're gonna wanna see this.
841,841,Trust me.
842,842,Thirty minutes. I'll have you back for meatloaf and gravy.
843,843,Thirty minutes.
844,844,Yeah.
845,845,Bloody hell.
846,846,Fresh off the plane from England.
847,847,"Now, she's still a little on the rare side of cooked."
848,848,Whoa! Come on.
849,849,Interesting.
850,850,Well?
851,851,It's awful.
852,852,It's worse than awful.
853,853,"Yeah, it doesn't track."
854,854,"You know, the third gear is too high."
855,855,Torque is not reaching the road.
856,856,Steering's loose because the front end gets light.
857,857,"And over 140, it thinks it's a..."
858,858,Airplane.
859,859,Yeah.
860,860,It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.
861,861,Anything else?
862,862,One sec.
863,863,You were back late last night.
864,864,Yeah.
865,865, Were you working?
866,866, Mmm.
867,867,"So, you didn't go anyplace?"
868,868,What?
869,869,"Well, I'm asking, did you go anyplace last night?"
870,870,Mollie.
871,871,It's a simple question.
872,872,"And I answered, didn't I?"
873,873,What was the answer?
874,874,"Is something up, love?"
875,875,What are you doing?
876,876,What are you doing?
877,877,You're driving very fast.
878,878,"Oh, am I? Am I?"
879,879,"Yes, you are."
880,880,Bloody hell! What are you...
881,881,The hell is this?
882,882,"Well, you tell me, 'cause I don't know."
883,883,"Right, slow down!"
884,884,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
885,885,Mollie!
886,886,"Please slow it down, all right?"
887,887,You trying to kill us or something?
888,888," Well, I thought we love this shit."
889,889, What?
890,890, Bloody hell!
891,891, It's a bit of racing fun. No?
892,892,"No, no, no."
893,893,It's not the same at all.
894,894,"Well, I think it's thrilling!"
895,895,All right.
896,896,"Look, I saw you, all right?"
897,897,"I saw you leaving with Shelby, and I saw you coming back."
898,898,Okay. Shit.
899,899,"Okay, but slow it..."
900,900,And then all day you've got that stupid look on your face.
901,901,"Mollie, slow down."
902,902,You're too close here.
903,903,"Mollie, put on the brakes right now..."
904,904,Not until you tell me what's going on!
905,905,All right.
906,906,I went to look at a car.
907,907, With Shelby?
908,908, With Shelby.
909,909, A racing car?
910,910, Sort of.
911,911,There's a corner coming.
912,912,You'd better hold on.
913,913,Oh! Are you gonna lift your foot off at all through this?
914,914,"No, 'cause I like a clean racing line."
915,915,Slow down!
916,916,Okay.
917,917,Shel offered me a job.
918,918,Ford has a car that they want to put up against a Ferrari.
919,919, You told me you were done.
920,920," That's it. Now, slow..."
921,921,I didn't say yes.
922,922,Slow down.
923,923,You told me you quit.
924,924, I don't understand.
925,925," Get fat and old, you said."
926,926,Fat and old.
927,927, I don't understand.
928,928, That's what you told me.
929,929,I don't understand.
930,930,Are you upset because I said I was done or because I looked at a race car?
931,931,"Just don't lie to me, Ken."
932,932,"Don't make it a secret, what you want or what you feel, just because you think it's gonna make me happy."
933,933,"Moll, I don't even know what I feel."
934,934,If you do this...
935,935,then he better be paying you this time.
936,936,'Cause I can't work any more hours and look after Peter.
937,937,"You know, the IRS have the garage."
938,938,I'm not losing my home.
939,939,It's 200 a day.
940,940,Plus expenses.
941,941,Are you shitting me?
942,942,But I haven't decided.
943,943,$200 a day?
944,944,Are you nuts?
945,945,Look at this.
946,946,This is ridiculous. Here.
947,947,"So, Shel, grabbing air."
948,948,That's the problem.
949,949,"Over 90, air's getting in, not getting out."
950,950,"It's the nose, I can feel it in the wheel."
951,951,"Mr. Miles, if there's a problem, the computer will find it."
952,952, All right.
953,953," Charlie, get some Scotch tape and a ball of wool."
954,954,"All right. Good, good, good."
955,955,"So, now let's just, uh, get all of this junk out."
956,956,"Right, Pops?"
957,957,"Yeah, yeah. I concur."
958,958,"Come on, guys."
959,959,What are they doing?
960,960,Making your car faster.
961,961,There. Right there.
962,962,Airflow's getting stuck.
963,963,I see it.
964,964,Yarn blows straight up.
965,965, Yep.
966,966, The front's lifting.
967,967,"Damn, he's right."
968,968,This car wants to go faster.
969,969,I feel it.
970,970,"Any lighter, we're getting fragile."
971,971,Took 70 pounds out of her in the last week.
972,972,She's outputting max horsepower from this displacement.
973,973,So put in a bigger engine.
974,974,Where we gonna put it?
975,975,On the roof?
976,976,Managed to make it than the NASCAR unit.
977,977,Allnew aluminum cylinder heads...
978,978,"vibration dampeners, water pump, smaller valves."
979,979,We call it the Beast.
980,980,"Yeah, I can see why, but how's it gonna fit without a redesign of the engine bed?"
981,981,"Well, it certainly wasn't easy."
982,982,"Good morning, gentlemen."
983,983,Mr. Shelby.
984,984,"So, you already put that in a GT40?"
985,985,I'm afraid we have.
986,986,I'll be damned.
987,987,"Well, it's heavy, of course."
988,988,"Problems with the handling, especially the stopping."
989,989, I can show you the data.
990,990, What problems?
991,991,"Understeers a little, but..."
992,992,Can I borrow that?
993,993,Just a second. Thank you.
994,994,Ken!
995,995,"Ken, perhaps you want to check with HQ before you test..."
996,996,What did he say?
997,997,We should ask...
998,998,Right.
999,999,"Oh, yes!"
1000,1000,"Mr. Shelby, welcome to Dearborn."
1001,1001,What are you doing at a test track?
1002,1002,You're gonna get Castrol oil all over that nice suit.
1003,1003,"Ah, I wanted to hear your thoughts on a few planning decisions."
1004,1004,"You know, personnel for Le Mans."
1005,1005,"Well, it's a hell of a lineup."
1006,1006,"Ken Miles, Phil Hill, Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren."
1007,1007,Hill's a lock.
1008,1008,"Amon, McLaren, too."
1009,1009,We're less sure about Miles.
1010,1010,We like Richie Ginther...
1011,1011,"Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant."
1012,1012,"Well, you're gonna want the best driver for the car."
1013,1013,Understands the machine.
1014,1014,That's Ken.
1015,1015,Oh! Yes!
1016,1016,"More of that, please."
1017,1017,"More of that, my girl."
1018,1018,"I may not get the finer points of racing, Mr. Shelby, but I do know people."
1019,1019,Miles is a...
1020,1020,"Well, he's a beatnik."
1021,1021,He dresses like one.
1022,1022,Ford means reliability.
1023,1023,Ken Miles is not a Ford man.
1024,1024,Whoa!
1025,1025,Giddyup! Giddyup!
1026,1026,"What's the lap record here, Burt?"
1027,1027, 1:50 dead.
1028,1028, A beatnik?
1029,1029,That man landed a busted tank on the beach at DDay and drove it clean across Europe to Berlin.
1030,1030,A beatnik?
1031,1031,"You know, Lee here asked me a while back, ""What's the one thing money can't buy?"" I'll tell you what it is."
1032,1032,A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.
1033,1033,That's Ken Miles.
1034,1034,"Well, be that as it may..."
1035,1035,we think he may be too pure.
1036,1036,"Carroll, do not lose sight of the big picture here."
1037,1037,"""Too pure""?"
1038,1038,What exactly does that mean?
1039,1039,It means he's all about himself.
1040,1040,"ABC puts a microphone under his nose, perhaps there's a detail he dislikes, millions watching..."
1041,1041,do you trust him not to put out the wrong message?
1042,1042,"Well, look, you can get a cleancut, allAmerican poster boy and stick him behind the wheel, teach him what to say."
1043,1043,"Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car, if all you want to do is lose."
1044,1044,"So, you don't agree with us on this issue?"
1045,1045,I'm saying you gotta trust me on this one.
1046,1046,"Carroll, with marketing concerns, that's just not possible."
1047,1047,"Put a Fordtype driver in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby."
1048,1048,That's the Ford way.
1049,1049,Yet another championship win for Ferrari as British driver John Surtees pilots his Ferrari 312...
1050,1050,Ferrari wins.
1051,1051,It's Surtees' first win since the '64...
1052,1052,Wedges. We have wedges.
1053,1053,"Oh, good, good, good."
1054,1054,Perfect.
1055,1055, 40?
1056,1056, Yep.
1057,1057," Hey, boss."
1058,1058," Hey, Dan."
1059,1059," Boss, Ferrari just bagged..."
1060,1060, You got a passport?
1061,1061,What's that?
1062,1062,Sign that. Get a passport.
1063,1063,Get it back to me by Friday. Frosty.
1064,1064,"Boys, I'm going to France."
1065,1065,Phil.
1066,1066,"Ken, can I get a word?"
1067,1067,Oh.
1068,1068,Can I take this?
1069,1069,Hey.
1070,1070,Do you know why Ford named it the GT40?
1071,1071,"Why they put that ""40"" on there?"
1072,1072, No.
1073,1073, Regulations. All right?
1074,1074,We gotta be 40 inches high to make the ground clearance requirements.
1075,1075,"No more, no less."
1076,1076,They measure it before every race.
1077,1077,"Problem is, that with that height, there's too much drag under the car, all right?"
1078,1078,"So, we have a solution."
1079,1079,Wedges. We put wedges in the suspension...
1080,1080,You're not coming next week.
1081,1081,"You're not coming, Ken."
1082,1082,"We're taking McLaren, Chris Amon, Phil Hill..."
1083,1083,and Bob Bondurant.
1084,1084,It's Ford's call.
1085,1085,"It is their opinion that you are not a good image, so you cannot drive their race car."
1086,1086,And putting aside the fact that you made that car whatever the hell it is...
1087,1087,and you're the best man I got behind the wheel...
1088,1088,I'm gonna reroute the oil line.
1089,1089,"If there's spillage, it could drip onto the rear nearside disc."
1090,1090,Ken...
1091,1091,Tell the boys to watch their pace come sunrise.
1092,1092,"The, uh, the gearbox will overheat."
1093,1093,"Ken, the race is starting soon."
1094,1094,Want it on the radio?
1095,1095,Not unless you do.
1096,1096,...of the race.
1097,1097,There they are.
1098,1098,"The Maserati going into the Esses, but it's still the number 2 car, driven by Chris Amon."
1099,1099,In third place is the number 1 Ford that is driven by Bruce McLaren.
1100,1100,A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.
1101,1101,"3:43.4 lap for car number 2, a Ford."
1102,1102,I think it's a little bit quick for this stage of the game.
1103,1103,Little bit quick right now.
1104,1104,Racing too hot.
1105,1105,"This could go down to the last hour or so, don't you think?"
1106,1106,"It could, but the probabilities for a finish like that in a 24hour race are awfully small."
1107,1107,Another Ford has come into the pits.
1108,1108,It's being pushed into the pits by the mechanics.
1109,1109,Head gasket.
1110,1110,The car's not a moon rocket.
1111,1111,"Trailing Bob Bondurant in fourth, car number 7."
1112,1112,"Leading number 20, Ferrari."
1113,1113,Michael Parkes.
1114,1114,"So, we have Ford running one, two, three. How about that?"
1115,1115,Too soon. Surely too soon.
1116,1116,One has to really be respectful of the mechanism with any...
1117,1117,"Here's the big story, the lead Ford, driven by Richie Ginther, retired with gearbox trouble, and the new leader..."
1118,1118,Gearbox. I told them.
1119,1119,Be gentle with it.
1120,1120,...and his partner Lorenzo Bandini...
1121,1121,...who was one of the winning drivers last year.
1122,1122,Who's there?
1123,1123,"Again, we're back, speaking to you live from Le Mans, France."
1124,1124,"The 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Grand Prix of Endurance, the 33rd renewal."
1125,1125,What's that you're listening to?
1126,1126,"Oh, some race over in France."
1127,1127,Exciting?
1128,1128,I'm not really paying much attention.
1129,1129,"However, Phil, there was one time in 1933, when the lead changed hands three times."
1130,1130,It's not exactly champagne...
1131,1131,...but it's got bubbles.
1132,1132,"Thanks, Mollie."
1133,1133,There's a difference between Ford and Ferrari...
1134,1134,Grace.
1135,1135,"Yes, sir."
1136,1136,I will send him right in.
1137,1137,Thank you.
1138,1138,"Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now."
1139,1139, All right.
1140,1140, Are you still willing to stake your reputation on this guy?
1141,1141,"This way, Mr. Shelby."
1142,1142,Mr. Ford.
1143,1143,Gentlemen.
1144,1144,Shelby.
1145,1145,Give me one reason why I don't fire everyone associated with this abomination starting with you.
1146,1146,"Well, sir..."
1147,1147,I was thinking about that very question as I sat out there in your lovely waiting room.
1148,1148,As I was sitting there...
1149,1149,I watched that little red folder right there...
1150,1150,go through four pairs of hands...
1151,1151,before it got to you.
1152,1152,'Course that doesn't include...
1153,1153,the 22 or so other Ford employees who probably poked at it before it made its way up to the 19th floor.
1154,1154,"All due respect, sir, you can't win a race by committee."
1155,1155,You need one man in charge.
1156,1156,"Now, the good news, as I see it, is that even with all the extra weight..."
1157,1157,we still managed to put old Mr. Ferrari exactly where we want him.
1158,1158,Did we?
1159,1159,"Oh, yes."
1160,1160,Expand.
1161,1161,Well...
1162,1162,"sure, we hadn't..."
1163,1163,We haven't worked out how to corner yet.
1164,1164,Or stay cool.
1165,1165,Or stay on the ground.
1166,1166,And a lot of stuff broke.
1167,1167,"In fact, the only thing that didn't break was the brakes."
1168,1168,"Hell, right now, we don't even know if our paint job will last the whole 24 hours."
1169,1169,But our last lap...
1170,1170,we clocked 218 miles an hour down the Mulsanne Straight.
1171,1171,"Now, in all his years of racing..."
1172,1172,old Enzo ain't never seen anything move that fast.
1173,1173,And now he knows...
1174,1174,without a doubt...
1175,1175,we're faster than he is...
1176,1176,even with the wrong driver...
1177,1177,and all the committees.
1178,1178,"And that's what he's thinking about while he's sitting in Modena, Italy..."
1179,1179,right now.
1180,1180,That man is scared to death...
1181,1181,that this year you actually might be smart enough to start trusting me.
1182,1182,"So, yeah..."
1183,1183,I'd say you got Ferrari exactly where you want him.
1184,1184,You're welcome.
1185,1185,Come here.
1186,1186,See that little building down there?
1187,1187,In World War II...
1188,1188,three out of five US bombers rolled off that line.
1189,1189,You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?
1190,1190,Think again.
1191,1191,This isn't the first time Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.
1192,1192,We know how to do more than push paper.
1193,1193,And there is one man running this company.
1194,1194,You report to him.
1195,1195,You understand me?
1196,1196,"Yes, sir."
1197,1197,"Go ahead, Carroll."
1198,1198,Go to war.
1199,1199,"Thank you, sir."
1200,1200,You were right.
1201,1201,It's the gearbox.
1202,1202,We ran too hot.
1203,1203,Three out of four of 'em broke.
1204,1204,The rod blew on the other one.
1205,1205,"We're going back, Ken."
1206,1206,"They told me I had ""carte blanche"" this time."
1207,1207,I looked it up.
1208,1208,"It's French for ""horseshit."" I know they're gonna squeeze our nuts any way they can soon as they work out how."
1209,1209,"Well, the, uh..."
1210,1210,ice cream's melting.
1211,1211,"All right. Hey, Ken."
1212,1212,You want me to apologize?
1213,1213,Mmm.
1214,1214,You want me to beg?
1215,1215,I don't know.
1216,1216,Let's try it out.
1217,1217,"Let's, uh, see how that feels."
1218,1218,"Ken, I'm sorry."
1219,1219,Sincerely.
1220,1220,Mmm.
1221,1221,Do you have any idea the kind of shit that I had to eat just to get four wheels on that grid?
1222,1222,"No, you don't."
1223,1223,'Cause you don't deal with any of that stuff.
1224,1224,"Now knock it off, Ken."
1225,1225,"We got work to do, and this car ain't gonna build itself."
1226,1226,Okay. All right.
1227,1227,God.
1228,1228,Come here.
1229,1229, Bloody car salesman.
1230,1230, Shit!
1231,1231,Come on.
1232,1232,Now you're gonna get it.
1233,1233,Get off me!
1234,1234,Stubborn son of a bitch.
1235,1235,God!
1236,1236, You just look...
1237,1237, Right.
1238,1238," Yeah, now."
1239,1239, You...
1240,1240, Ow!
1241,1241, You all right?
1242,1242,Shit!
1243,1243,Now you're gonna get it.
1244,1244,Come here.
1245,1245,Done.
1246,1246,"Mollie, darling."
1247,1247,"Yes, love?"
1248,1248,"Can I get a fizzy pop, please?"
1249,1249,"Yes, love."
1250,1250,"You want one, too, Shelby?"
1251,1251, No. No.
1252,1252," Uh, yes, please, Mollie."
1253,1253,No. He can get his own.
1254,1254,"Just for me, please."
1255,1255,How long has that been?
1256,1256,"Oh, it's gotta be three or four years, at least."
1257,1257,Right. Riverside.
1258,1258,Yeah.
1259,1259,SCCA Divisional Championship.
1260,1260,You broke my finger.
1261,1261,"What's that nippy bloody thing you do under the arm, that thing?"
1262,1262,Yeah. I call that the Llama Bite.
1263,1263,You name it?
1264,1264,Where'd you learn that?
1265,1265,The Girl Scouts?
1266,1266, What? You wanna go again?
1267,1267, Here you go.
1268,1268,You're an angel.
1269,1269,Thank you.
1270,1270,My pleasure.
1271,1271,"Right. Well, I'm about to go to the grocery store."
1272,1272,Anything you think you'll need?
1273,1273,"Um, ice cream."
1274,1274,"Ice cream would be good and, uh..."
1275,1275,bread.
1276,1276,Right.
1277,1277,"No, I'm good."
1278,1278,Thank you.
1279,1279,"Thanks, Moll."
1280,1280,You still take those for your ticker?
1281,1281,Only 'cause they're so delicious.
1282,1282, Up yours.
1283,1283," Oh, go to hell."
1284,1284,Come on.
1285,1285,Giddyup. Giddyup. Giddyup.
1286,1286,"Phil! Here's the one for you, mate."
1287,1287,"Dino, come here."
1288,1288,Well?
1289,1289,There's still lag when I hit the gas.
1290,1290,Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.
1291,1291,"Charlie, get a Holley carb."
1292,1292,We're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.
1293,1293,"Three weeks to Daytona, and it still feels like a bag of squirrels."
1294,1294,Brake heat.
1295,1295,That's a whole different ball game.
1296,1296,"All right, Petey, let's go for that ride."
1297,1297,What are you doing?
1298,1298,You see that crack?
1299,1299,That's my marker for turn eight.
1300,1300,"What, to slow down?"
1301,1301,"Uh, brush the brakes and downshift."
1302,1302,But you'll be going Yeah.
1303,1303,So how do you see it?
1304,1304,"You're going fast, but as the car speeds up..."
1305,1305,everything else slows down.
1306,1306,You don't do that.
1307,1307,You do this. Right?
1308,1308,And then you see everything.
1309,1309,Do you set other markers?
1310,1310,Indeed I do.
1311,1311,Lots of them.
1312,1312,"Yeah, 'cause you can't just push the car hard the whole way, right?"
1313,1313,That's right. You have to be kind to the car.
1314,1314,You feel the poor thing groaning underneath you.
1315,1315,"If you're gonna push a piece of machinery to the limit and expect it to hold together, you have to have some sense of where that limit is."
1316,1316,Look out there.
1317,1317,Out there is the perfect lap.
1318,1318,No mistakes.
1319,1319,"Every gear change, every corner..."
1320,1320,perfect.
1321,1321,You see it?
1322,1322,I think so.
1323,1323,Most people can't.
1324,1324,"Most people don't even know it's out there, but it is."
1325,1325,It's there.
1326,1326,You want some ice cream?
1327,1327, Yeah.
1328,1328, All right.
1329,1329,"Come on, then."
1330,1330,Do you know what this marker is?
1331,1331, What?
1332,1332, That one.
1333,1333,Pull my finger.
1334,1334,You'll find out.
1335,1335,How much longer before he comes in?
1336,1336,"Uh, well, we change drivers every four hours,  so about 10 minutes."
1337,1337," No, hang on."
1338,1338,You're saying Beebe is 100 percent in charge now?
1339,1339,"Yes, and he wants Miles gone."
1340,1340,"Look, it's personal with this guy."
1341,1341,"And, yes, he has the leverage to stick it to you."
1342,1342,He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.
1343,1343,He's gonna tell you in person.
1344,1344,"Now, all he is hoping for  is that you lose your cool."
1345,1345, Uhhuh.
1346,1346,It's time to let this go.
1347,1347,You cannot destroy the whole thing.
1348,1348,Not for one goddamn guy.
1349,1349," Sure, I can."
1350,1350," Well, why?"
1351,1351,"'Cause while we're here talking, he's out there getting it done."
1352,1352,"Oh, shit!"
1353,1353,He's got brake fade.
1354,1354,Ease off!
1355,1355,Carroll?
1356,1356, Get him out!
1357,1357, Peter!
1358,1358,Go on. Go inside.
1359,1359,Just stay there.
1360,1360, Get Ken!
1361,1361, Ken!
1362,1362,Get him out!
1363,1363,There he is!
1364,1364,Ken!
1365,1365,I can see him.
1366,1366, Ken!
1367,1367, Come on.
1368,1368,The brakes.
1369,1369,Let's just rip out the damn engine. All right?
1370,1370,We can't use it if we can't stop.
1371,1371,"You know, the brakes would last longer if we slowed down a bit."
1372,1372,Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of the extra power?
1373,1373,"You know, I thought the whole point was to win the damned race."
1374,1374,Maybe we could design a new assembly.
1375,1375,Instead of swapping out the pads in the pits...
1376,1376,swap out the entire braking system.
1377,1377,Rotors included.
1378,1378,Put in a fresh one.
1379,1379,"Wait, wait, wait, Pops, are we allowed to do that?"
1380,1380,I don't know.
1381,1381,I don't read French.
1382,1382,"Well, brakes are ""a part"" like any other, right?"
1383,1383,We are allowed to change parts.
1384,1384,Yes.
1385,1385,Will we have time to do that?
1386,1386,"I don't know yet, Charlie."
1387,1387,I'm gonna take him home.
1388,1388,All right.
1389,1389,Sort this shit out.
1390,1390,I will.
1391,1391,Have you ever been on fire?
1392,1392,"Uh, well, no, it's never happened to me."
1393,1393,"But the suit's flameproof, see?"
1394,1394,"It, uh, keeps heat out."
1395,1395,Yeah.
1396,1396,But LewisEvans burned to death in the Moroccan Grand Prix.
1397,1397,He had a flameproof suit on.
1398,1398,"Mmhmm. Yeah, but, um..."
1399,1399,"See, he got stuck."
1400,1400,He couldn't breathe.
1401,1401,"So, as long as you get out of the car, you're okay."
1402,1402,Dad got out.
1403,1403, He sure did.
1404,1404, Peter!
1405,1405,Bye.
1406,1406,See ya.
1407,1407, You all right?
1408,1408, Yeah.
1409,1409,What's wrong with you?
1410,1410,And don't be telling me brakes or me almost kicking the bucket out there.
1411,1411,"It's something to do with the suits, isn't it?"
1412,1412,It's under control.
1413,1413,What is it?
1414,1414,"You know how we talked about how you do your thing, I do my thing?"
1415,1415, This is my thing.
1416,1416," Really, Shel..."
1417,1417,"Just trust me, Ken."
1418,1418,You got a plan?
1419,1419,Absolutely.
1420,1420,It a good one?
1421,1421,It's high risk.
1422,1422,How high risk?
1423,1423,Extremely high risk.
1424,1424,"Well, that's something."
1425,1425, Glad we had this talk.
1426,1426, Anytime.
1427,1427,"Mr. Ford, this is a surprise."
1428,1428,"Apologies for the unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby, but when a man pays $9 million for an automobile, he ought to at least be able to see it."
1429,1429,"Well, that sounds reasonable enough."
1430,1430,"Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?"
1431,1431,Sure.
1432,1432, In private?
1433,1433," Uh, yeah."
1434,1434,That would be preferable.
1435,1435,All right.
1436,1436,"Hey, Phil."
1437,1437,You wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?
1438,1438,"Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington."
1439,1439,Of course.
1440,1440,"Come up to my office, Leo."
1441,1441," Pleasure to meet you, sir."
1442,1442, Phil.
1443,1443,Give you a little tour of your car.
1444,1444,"We, uh, took out your 289 small block..."
1445,1445,and put in a 427 7liter.
1446,1446,"Uh, firstly, I want to just clear the air."
1447,1447,I hope that whatever disagreements between us can just be chalked up...
1448,1448,to natural redbloodedness in the heat of battle.
1449,1449,"Oh, I appreciate that, Leo."
1450,1450,"Truly, I do."
1451,1451,"It falls on me, Shelby, to inform you that I have been appointed overall executive director of the racing program."
1452,1452,"Now, I do hope that this won't be a problem between us."
1453,1453,"Well, I assure you, Leo, it will not."
1454,1454,"Hey, Carroll..."
1455,1455,Carroll!
1456,1456,"And what is that top speed with the, uh, 427?"
1457,1457,"Well, why don't we take it for a spin?"
1458,1458, What?
1459,1459," Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford."
1460,1460, Hop on in. Go on.
1461,1461, You want me to...
1462,1462,Just see what $9 million feels like.
1463,1463,Hey!
1464,1464,God...
1465,1465,Open the door!
1466,1466,"Hey, open the door!"
1467,1467,Open the door!
1468,1468,"Just hold me right there, and you take my hand."
1469,1469,"Oh, God. I sat on my nuts."
1470,1470,We're gonna build the next one for comfort. Don't you worry.
1471,1471,Open the door.
1472,1472,"Sorry, sir, if you just give me a moment."
1473,1473, Open the door.
1474,1474, It's a sticky one.
1475,1475,You ready?
1476,1476,"The name on the middle of that steering wheel should tell you that I was born ready, Shelby. Hit it."
1477,1477,Attaboy.
1478,1478,"Whoa! It's got a little kick, doesn't it?"
1479,1479, Open this door.
1480,1480," Oh, there we go."
1481,1481,"Good God, Mr. Beebe."
1482,1482,"You okay, sir?"
1483,1483,"Whoa! Oh, my God!"
1484,1484,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
1485,1485,"Yeah, baby."
1486,1486,"Yeah, baby."
1487,1487,It's about right now the uninitiated have a tendency to soil themselves.
1488,1488,"Oh, my God! Whoa!"
1489,1489,Mr. Ford...
1490,1490,You okay?
1491,1491,Mr. Ford...
1492,1492,you all right?
1493,1493,I had no idea.
1494,1494,I had no idea.
1495,1495,I wish my daddy...
1496,1496,he were alive to see this.
1497,1497,To feel this.
1498,1498,"Now, this is not a machine just anybody can get in and easily control."
1499,1499,Absolutely not.
1500,1500,I had no idea.
1501,1501,"Now, you wanna win Le Mans."
1502,1502,"If you really wanna take first place, Ken Miles is the man to do it."
1503,1503,Good timing.
1504,1504,"Now, he knows this car because he helped me build it."
1505,1505,"Shelby, you know I've already appointed Leo Beebe director of racing."
1506,1506,Which is exactly why I'm talking to you.
1507,1507,"Now, you let Ken Miles race Daytona."
1508,1508,If he wins...
1509,1509,he gets to drive Le Mans.
1510,1510,And if he doesn't?
1511,1511,Ford Motor Company gets full ownership of Shelby American.
1512,1512,"Lock, stock, and brand."
1513,1513,Forever.
1514,1514,"We're in hour six at the Daytona 24, and Fords are dominating the leaderboard."
1515,1515,Shelby American's Ken Miles holds a narrow lead over the HolmanMoody Ford driven by Walt Hansgen.
1516,1516,"I don't bloody think so, Walt."
1517,1517,"Oh, this race is not just a test of our cars, but also our teams."
1518,1518,"As you know, we have a second team out there today."
1519,1519, HolmanMoody.
1520,1520, That's right.
1521,1521,"Number 95, Hansgen, blisters through the front trioval while closing in on Ken Miles."
1522,1522,Walt's pushing her too fast.
1523,1523,"He's pushing 7,000 RPM."
1524,1524,"Hey, get the EZ sign out there."
1525,1525,Come on. Move. Do it now.
1526,1526,Every one of these GTs out there today is under my direct supervision.
1527,1527,And of course the supervision of Henry Ford II.
1528,1528,"The drivers, the speed, the strategy..."
1529,1529,even the RPMs are determined by us.
1530,1530,Ken Miles is locked in a pitched battle with Hansgen as they pass the grandstand.
1531,1531,Hansgen is taking a run at Miles entering turn one.
1532,1532,Miles is boxed in.
1533,1533,Hansgen slips by and takes the lead approaching the infield chicane.
1534,1534,Cor blimey!
1535,1535,Did you see that?
1536,1536,The caution flag is out.
1537,1537,Still racing.
1538,1538,"Hey, we are still racing."
1539,1539,"Come on, guys, let's go!"
1540,1540,Let's go. Move it.
1541,1541,He's coming in.
1542,1542,"Let's go, let's go, guys. Come on."
1543,1543,"Go, tires up."
1544,1544,"Here, right here."
1545,1545,Let's go. Let's go. Move it.
1546,1546, Fuel flying in.
1547,1547, Breaker bar!
1548,1548, We're good.
1549,1549, It all checked out.
1550,1550, 36. 38.
1551,1551, Go! Go!
1552,1552,Hansgen is right up our arse.
1553,1553,If I can just get outta the pit ahead of him...
1554,1554,"She's running hot, but I think she'll hold."
1555,1555, Fuel's low.
1556,1556, Bring up the scoop.
1557,1557,She's hot.
1558,1558,"Hey there, Walt."
1559,1559,Good to see you.
1560,1560,"Yeah, after I get out of this pit, Shelby, it's the last time you will."
1561,1561,"Oh, don't worry."
1562,1562,We got rearview mirrors.
1563,1563,What happened to that Mustang he took out?
1564,1564,Don't know yet.
1565,1565,"I can push her harder than six, Shel."
1566,1566, I can feel it.
1567,1567, Uhhuh.
1568,1568,"Hey, how come these guys pit so much faster than we do?"
1569,1569,"They got a goddamn NASCAR crew, that's why."
1570,1570, No shit?
1571,1571, No shit.
1572,1572,"Go! Go, come on."
1573,1573,"We're clear, we're clear."
1574,1574,Goddamn NASCAR crew.
1575,1575,"Go, go, go!"
1576,1576,"Guys, they've already left."
1577,1577,Hello?
1578,1578,There's my Mollie. Hello.
1579,1579,"Hiya, love."
1580,1580, Mom? Mom?
1581,1581, What are you doing?
1582,1582,Just having a cuppa.
1583,1583,"Mom, ask him about the brakes."
1584,1584, Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.m.
1585,1585, Ask him.
1586,1586,Go to bed. Now.
1587,1587,I take it he's not asleep.
1588,1588,I'm sure he smuggled in a radio.
1589,1589,Yeah.
1590,1590,"He said to ask, ""How are the brakes?"" The brakes? Yes. No, no, no."
1591,1591,Tell him they're working for now.
1592,1592,"You know, Shelby's been acting very strange."
1593,1593, Ford have gone...
1594,1594, Ken.
1595,1595,...and put up another team.
1596,1596, With a GT.
1597,1597, Ken.
1598,1598,"Some sort of yampy, bloody corporate test or something."
1599,1599,Just take a rest whenever you get a chance.
1600,1600,"Sorry, my love, what were you saying?"
1601,1601,You've only got a few hours.
1602,1602,I can't hear you very well.
1603,1603,I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
1604,1604,Wish me luck.
1605,1605, Good luck.
1606,1606," I love you, darling."
1607,1607,"After 23 hours here at Daytona, Walt Hansgen driving the green and white Ford has a commanding lead over Ken Miles and Shelby American as the rest of the field has fallen off the pace."
1608,1608,We're locked out.
1609,1609,Ain't nothing Miles can do this late in the race.
1610,1610,Engine's hot. We gotta keep it under six thou.
1611,1611,All right.
1612,1612,She could come apart.
1613,1613,One way to find out.
1614,1614,"I thought we were keeping him under 6,000?"
1615,1615,"Shut up, Don."
1616,1616,"With only minutes of racing left here at Daytona, a pitched battle for the lead is being waged as the number 98 Ford makes an incredible late surge."
1617,1617, What's happening?
1618,1618, He's moving up.
1619,1619,"...entering the front trioval, Ken Miles' desperate bid for the win may prove to be..."
1620,1620,Come on now!
1621,1621,White flag! Last lap!
1622,1622,Miles is pushing him. Hard.
1623,1623,"That's it, girl."
1624,1624,Ken Miles drafts Walt Hansgen coming into the final turn.
1625,1625,Come on. Come on.
1626,1626,What the hell?
1627,1627,Come on.
1628,1628,All right.
1629,1629,Look at this now.
1630,1630,Damn it!
1631,1631,Yeah!
1632,1632,"Ken Miles takes the checkered flag, bringing glory to Shelby American."
1633,1633,How about that?
1634,1634,"Reliability, strength..."
1635,1635,"Yes, Leo."
1636,1636,"Mr. Ford, sir, we won."
1637,1637,Uhhuh.
1638,1638,We won! Ford won Daytona.
1639,1639,Hot damn.
1640,1640,"And which team was it, Leo?"
1641,1641,Shelby American.
1642,1642,Miles driving.
1643,1643,Son of a bitch.
1644,1644,All right.
1645,1645,Where the hell is he?
1646,1646,"Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait."
1647,1647,Someone lost a bulldog on the beach.
1648,1648,"No, no. Come on. Come on."
1649,1649,Come on.
1650,1650,Let's go. Let's go.
1651,1651,Someone get this man a drink.
1652,1652,Someone get him a drink.
1653,1653,Oi.
1654,1654,"In bed, you."
1655,1655,What are you doing?
1656,1656,Dirty stop out.
1657,1657,I was...
1658,1658,"drawing a map, so I could follow you on Le Mans."
1659,1659,Mmm.
1660,1660,Look at that.
1661,1661,That is spot on.
1662,1662,"You are a dab hand, very accurate."
1663,1663,Tell me about the track.
1664,1664,"No, I can't, Petey."
1665,1665,Please.
1666,1666,"Well, you start at the start line."
1667,1667,"Yeah, but you actually start here because you have to run to your car at Le Mans."
1668,1668,True enough.
1669,1669,"So, once your old man manages to hobble over..."
1670,1670, and pull out...
1671,1671, And not hit anyone.
1672,1672,"Yes, right."
1673,1673,Then you accelerate very hard up to Dunlop Bridge...
1674,1674,road banking away from ya and down through the trees to the Esses...
1675,1675,and accelerate up to Tertre Rouge.
1676,1676,Critical first gear corner.
1677,1677,Fast entry.
1678,1678,Keep your speed up for your exit onto...
1679,1679,Mulsanne.
1680,1680,"Long straightaway, hemmed in by poplars."
1681,1681,"Top gear, 210 miles per hour."
1682,1682,"And down to third, revs up."
1683,1683,Revs are your friend.
1684,1684,Get a maximum exit.
1685,1685,Let the car run free.
1686,1686,Over the brow...
1687,1687,then wham!
1688,1688,Mulsanne Corner.
1689,1689,Accelerate to Arnage and then over the rise to the White House.
1690,1690,You get that right and...
1691,1691,your first three and a half minutes...
1692,1692,of 24 hours.
1693,1693,But... you can't make every lap perfect.
1694,1694,But I can try.
1695,1695,All right.
1696,1696,"Off to bed, you."
1697,1697,I will... wake you...
1698,1698,before I leave for France.
1699,1699,I promise.
1700,1700,Okay. Good night.
1701,1701,"Eh, where's, um..."
1702,1702,Where's that?
1703,1703,The Hotel Saint Pierre?
1704,1704,Where?
1705,1705,It's gonna rain again tomorrow.
1706,1706,There's always rain here.
1707,1707,"Start'll be dry though, so we'll swap out your tires come rain."
1708,1708,Yeah.
1709,1709,"Might be smart to sleep, Bulldog."
1710,1710,"Well, you, too."
1711,1711,I'm not driving.
1712,1712,"That's a bloody shame, that."
1713,1713,"Oh, hell, I couldn't make this team."
1714,1714,I'm gonna go walk the first corner.
1715,1715,I figured.
1716,1716,Counting on it.
1717,1717,Ken.
1718,1718,Chaz.
1719,1719,"We'll change the color of them seats, shall we, Frost?"
1720,1720,"Well, if this were a beauty pageant..."
1721,1721,we just lost.
1722,1722,"Looks fast, don't it?"
1723,1723,"Ah, looks aren't everything."
1724,1724,Scarfiotti and Bandini start for Ferrari.
1725,1725,You can take him.
1726,1726,"Four minutes, Ken."
1727,1727,"Four minutes, buddy."
1728,1728,"Live from Le Mans, France."
1729,1729,Mom! Come on.
1730,1730,"All right, coming."
1731,1731,The 24 Hours of Le Mans.
1732,1732,And there are the cars lined up...
1733,1733,"Drivers, please take your places."
1734,1734, And there they are...
1735,1735, There he is.
1736,1736,"...lined up, ready to go."
1737,1737,They're lined up as per their practice times.
1738,1738,Faster cars are up to our left.
1739,1739,"Oh, bloody joking!"
1740,1740,"Number 10, a Bizzarrini, almost loses control."
1741,1741,It's all right.
1742,1742,"You looked great out there, sir."
1743,1743,What happened to Miles?
1744,1744,Bloody hell.
1745,1745,No.
1746,1746,Poxy bastard.
1747,1747,"After one lap, BandiniFerrari is in first place."
1748,1748,Where is Miles?
1749,1749,Where the hell is Ken?
1750,1750,I don't know.
1751,1751,He's coming in.
1752,1752,Oi! He's coming in.
1753,1753,He's coming in.
1754,1754,Let's go.
1755,1755,"Frosty, come on."
1756,1756,Let's go. Move it.
1757,1757,I think it's his door.
1758,1758,That's a rough start for the Ford team so early...
1759,1759,The bloody door won't close!
1760,1760,All right. All right.
1761,1761,We'll take care of it.
1762,1762,"Come on, guys."
1763,1763,Damn door!
1764,1764, Try that.
1765,1765, This'll do it.
1766,1766,"Shelby, what the hell is wrong?"
1767,1767,Something's hitting the frame.
1768,1768,"Oh, you're joking, aren't ya?"
1769,1769,"Guys, get outta the way."
1770,1770,Just get outta the way.
1771,1771,Hold it.
1772,1772,"Go! Go, go, go!"
1773,1773,He's back out.
1774,1774,Go.
1775,1775,"Ken Miles, in Shelby American's Ford number 1, in tenth place."
1776,1776,Tremendous gains for Ken Miles in Ford number 1.
1777,1777," Come on, Dad. Come on."
1778,1778, Passing Porsche 43.
1779,1779,Moving quickly into the top 20. He's passing them...
1780,1780,"Ken Miles, Ford, has set a new lap record."
1781,1781,Three minutes and 34 seconds.
1782,1782, Yeah!
1783,1783, Ken Miles passed it with a time of 3:34.3.
1784,1784,Shelby.
1785,1785,He's pushing the car too hard.
1786,1786,That's not the plan.
1787,1787,Plans change.
1788,1788,Lap is 3:34.
1789,1789,Track is 8.36.
1790,1790,Someone tell me the miles per hour!
1791,1791,"Three minutes, 31.9."
1792,1792, Another lap record!
1793,1793, That's an average speed of 142.01 miles per hour.
1794,1794,"Let's go. Let's go, boys."
1795,1795,"Tea's ready, Ken."
1796,1796,"Oh, thank you, Chaz."
1797,1797," Happy birthday, old chap!"
1798,1798," Cheers, mate. Great run."
1799,1799,"Go, boys."
1800,1800,"Move, move, move."
1801,1801,Need a quick body check!
1802,1802,You're three seconds faster than Gurney.
1803,1803,"If you hadn't blown the start, you'd be in the lead."
1804,1804,Can you keep this up?
1805,1805,Can the car?
1806,1806,There has been an incident on turn six.
1807,1807,Number 18 and number 26 have collided.
1808,1808,"It appears Ferrari number 20, Ludovico Scarfiotti, has also left the track."
1809,1809," All right, watch your head."
1810,1810, Here you go.
1811,1811,Thank you.
1812,1812,"Have a good dinner, sir."
1813,1813,"Oi, McLaren's pitting."
1814,1814,Mr. Ford's probably going somewhere nice for dinner.
1815,1815,"What do you mean ""probably""?"
1816,1816,Rain's coming.
1817,1817,All right.
1818,1818,Coming in.
1819,1819,"Go, tires up!"
1820,1820,Get 'em checked out.
1821,1821,"Engine's running hot, Pops."
1822,1822, All right.
1823,1823," She's hot, mate. Crack on."
1824,1824, Go.
1825,1825," Well done, Denny."
1826,1826,Tire.
1827,1827,Dash clear.
1828,1828,Swap.
1829,1829,We're at 220. We're okay.
1830,1830,All right.
1831,1831,Fuel flying in.
1832,1832,Rear tires coming up the wall!
1833,1833,Get the fuel in there.
1834,1834,Come on. Let's go.
1835,1835,Swap that out.
1836,1836,Front set.
1837,1837,We're good.
1838,1838, Get it moving!
1839,1839, Go! Go!
1840,1840,"Go, go!"
1841,1841,"Good job, guys."
1842,1842,Good job.
1843,1843,"It was a good change, fellas."
1844,1844,"Hey, I need a stopwatch."
1845,1845,Did you see that? The great American automobile magnate leaves in a helicopter. Very classy.
1846,1846,Lorenzo Bandini remains in first place for Ferrari.
1847,1847,"Easy, Dan."
1848,1848,You're getting boxed in.
1849,1849,"He's not batting on a full wicket, that one."
1850,1850,"Easy, Dan."
1851,1851,"Oh, bloody hell!"
1852,1852,You arsehole.
1853,1853,"Oh, piss off!"
1854,1854,You wanker!
1855,1855,"A face like a smacked arse, now, don't ya?"
1856,1856,Porsche number 58 with an unidentified Ford are run off the track at Arnage.
1857,1857,"Go, Ken. Come on, Ken."
1858,1858,Nice stopwatch.
1859,1859,You want one? They're Italian.
1860,1860,Ken Miles in Ford number 1 and Bandini in Ferrari 21 are locked in a battle against the elements as they push their cars to the limit past the White House corner.
1861,1861,"And now with all that rain, the track conditions are wet and slippery so expect these very fast laps to suffer."
1862,1862,"Yes, sir?"
1863,1863,"Yes, sir."
1864,1864,"Yes, sir."
1865,1865,"Okay, sir."
1866,1866,"Right away, sir."
1867,1867,Hey!
1868,1868,What the hell are you doing?
1869,1869,Give me that.
1870,1870,Dumbass.
1871,1871,Mr. Shelby...
1872,1872,Here we go.
1873,1873,"Come on, girl."
1874,1874,Come on.
1875,1875,Hold it together now.
1876,1876,God!
1877,1877,Bugger! Come on.
1878,1878,The leader at this moment is Ferrari number 21 being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.
1879,1879,His brakes are shot.
1880,1880,"All right, here we go."
1881,1881,It looks like Ken Miles is bringing the number 1 Ford.
1882,1882,into the pits very slowly.
1883,1883,He could have a...
1884,1884,Coming in.
1885,1885,"Watch yourself, guys."
1886,1886, Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
1887,1887, Yeah.
1888,1888,"All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go."
1889,1889,I had him. I almost had him.
1890,1890,"Well, he's putting another lap on us now."
1891,1891,All right. Fit it in.
1892,1892,Do the upper arm first.
1893,1893,"Come on, let's go."
1894,1894,"Come in now, now. Faster."
1895,1895,Let's go.
1896,1896,Upper arm first.
1897,1897,Watch the brake line pulling it out.
1898,1898,They're doing it. The brakes.
1899,1899,"Now, that's gonna take..."
1900,1900,I said watch the brake line.
1901,1901,Faster!
1902,1902,Faster! Faster!
1903,1903,Coming in.
1904,1904,Watch your back!
1905,1905,"Jeff, you've gotta be faster!"
1906,1906,"Bleed the brakes, Jeff."
1907,1907,"No, no, no."
1908,1908,It's against the rules.
1909,1909,You cannot just change things.
1910,1910,"Oh, no, no, no."
1911,1911,"You show me where it says in your book that we cannot swap out the system, and then you can disqualify us."
1912,1912,"Bulldog, back off."
1913,1913,Calm down. Calm down.
1914,1914,This is not legal.
1915,1915,You show me where it says in that little rule book where I can't swap out my upright assembly.
1916,1916,A part is a part.
1917,1917,"Be it a brake caliper, a rotor, or an upright assembly, and I can swap out any damn thing I want to."
1918,1918,We read your damn rule book.
1919,1919,Bandini's pitting.
1920,1920,He's pitting.
1921,1921,"Oh, what a shame."
1922,1922,I think he blew a line.
1923,1923,"Well, he was trying to keep up with you."
1924,1924,"I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy."
1925,1925,"Get me out of here, Pops."
1926,1926, Come on!
1927,1927, All right.
1928,1928,Come on!
1929,1929,"Almost there, Ken."
1930,1930,Almost there.
1931,1931,"How's it looking, buddy?"
1932,1932,"One pump, and we're good."
1933,1933,"Car's yours, Ken."
1934,1934,"All right, listen, you can still take him, but you gotta pass him twice."
1935,1935,I get it. Pass him twice.
1936,1936,"Ford number 1 driven by Ken Miles is back out, hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21."
1937,1937,"Not bloody good enough, Miles! Come on!"
1938,1938,He's off his pace.
1939,1939,He doesn't trust the car yet.
1940,1940,"Come on, Ken."
1941,1941,"I gave you new brakes, buddy."
1942,1942,All right.
1943,1943,What did you come here for?
1944,1944,Let's do it.
1945,1945,That's it! Come on!
1946,1946,He ain't done it yet.
1947,1947,He needs to take another lap on him.
1948,1948,He needs to pit soon.
1949,1949,He needs to catch Bandini first.
1950,1950,"All right, you bastard."
1951,1951,Let's do this again.
1952,1952,"Come on, now."
1953,1953,That's my girl!
1954,1954,That's my girl!
1955,1955,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
1956,1956,Bloody hell!
1957,1957,He did it. We're in the lead.
1958,1958,Are we in the lead?
1959,1959,What about Bandini?
1960,1960,Where's Bandini?
1961,1961,They're done. Finished.
1962,1962,Ferrari's over.
1963,1963,McLaren's four minutes behind him in a GT.
1964,1964,"So we're lying Ken first, and two and three. All Fords."
1965,1965,Ferrari number 21 and driver Bandini have left the track.
1966,1966,The Deuce is coming.
1967,1967,Ken's up in a half an hour.
1968,1968,Want me to wake him?
1969,1969,"Nah, let him sleep."
1970,1970, Thank you very much. Thank you.
1971,1971, Unbelievable.
1972,1972, Hello.
1973,1973, Mr. Ford.
1974,1974,"We're not quite there yet, but..."
1975,1975,You missed a good meal.
1976,1976,There he is. There he is.
1977,1977,"Brief me, Leo."
1978,1978,"We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford."
1979,1979,Who's in the lead?
1980,1980,"Hulme, Miles."
1981,1981,"You know, I was thinking, Mr. Ford..."
1982,1982,wouldn't it be great if all three Fords lined up and crossed the finish line at the exact same time?
1983,1983,They all lined up and came home together.
1984,1984,Ford. Ford. Ford.
1985,1985,"I don't think we can actually do that, sir, but..."
1986,1986,Why not?
1987,1987,"Miles is laps ahead, Leo."
1988,1988,"What would you have him do, slow down?"
1989,1989,Yeah.
1990,1990,Mr. Ford wants Miles to slow down.
1991,1991,He wants all three cars to cross at the exact same time.
1992,1992,He thinks it'll be a historic moment for Ford.
1993,1993,It'll make a great photograph.
1994,1994,"Shelby, Miles needs to be a team player here, and so do you."
1995,1995,"You gonna tell him, or you need me to?"
1996,1996,Don't go near my driver.
1997,1997,Go on.
1998,1998,This is what Mr. Ford wants.
1999,1999,Go on now.
2000,2000, He expects loyalty.
2001,2001, Go on.
2002,2002," Guys, let's go. Come on."
2003,2003," All right, look lively, boys."
2004,2004,Let's go. Frosty.
2005,2005,"Yeah, coming."
2006,2006,Let's go. Come on.
2007,2007,What's Beebe want?
2008,2008,Oh.
2009,2009,"It's off the scale, innit?"
2010,2010,They want you to slow down.
2011,2011,Run that by me again.
2012,2012,They want you to slow down.
2013,2013,"You're outshining their car, Ken."
2014,2014,You're four minutes up on McLaren.
2015,2015,"The Deuce wants the three Fords to cross the finish line one, two, three, all together."
2016,2016,They're asking that you be a team player...
2017,2017,and make that photograph happen for 'em.
2018,2018,That photograph.
2019,2019,That's good.
2020,2020,That is good. Mmm.
2021,2021,"Ken, even if you tie for first..."
2022,2022,you'd still be the first man ever to win...
2023,2023,"Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year."
2024,2024,You'd have the triple crown.
2025,2025,"Look, I ain't get..."
2026,2026,I haven't been able to get you to follow an order since day one.
2027,2027,Whatever you wanna do is fine with me.
2028,2028,My choice?
2029,2029,Your choice.
2030,2030,The engine's running at boiling.
2031,2031,The brakes are shot.
2032,2032,How was that?
2033,2033,Taken care of.
2034,2034,"The car's yours, Ken."
2035,2035,"Ken, the car's yours."
2036,2036,Ken!
2037,2037,"Car's yours, Ken."
2038,2038,"It's the Fords that are the cars to beat, claiming the top three positions..."
2039,2039,What the hell is he doing?
2040,2040,...led by Ken Miles in Ford number 1...
2041,2041,If you're not watching this right now...
2042,2042,Don't answer that.
2043,2043,Get away from it.
2044,2044,Get away from it.
2045,2045,Ken Miles in Ford number 1 is demonstrating why he's one of the top drivers here at Le Mans with an outstanding display of skill.
2046,2046,Keep an eye on Ford number 1.
2047,2047,He's gonna break his own record.
2048,2048,Shut up.
2049,2049,Wait for it.
2050,2050,Wait for it.
2051,2051,Now.
2052,2052,Miles. Miles. Miles.
2053,2053,Miles. Miles. Miles.
2054,2054,Miles. Miles. Miles.
2055,2055,That's another record.
2056,2056,Another lap record falls to Ken Miles...
2057,2057,It's a perfect lap.
2058,2058,...breaking his own record and virtually guaranteeing first place for Shelby American and their exciting GT40.
2059,2059,Ken Miles in Shelby America's Ford number 1 just beat his own lap record.
2060,2060,Three minutes and 30.6 seconds...
2061,2061,Bring him in.
2062,2062,Right now!
2063,2063,He's outta control.
2064,2064,"Now, you bring him in before he wrecks that car and we don't finish."
2065,2065,"Bring him in, Shelby, or I will get you banned from the SCCA and the FIA."
2066,2066,"Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo."
2067,2067,That's his car to the finish.
2068,2068,"HAPPY I'm HAPPY I know I am, I'm sure I am Woo!"
2069,2069,Oh.
2070,2070,"Come on, lads, where are ya?"
2071,2071,That is quite a sight to see.
2072,2072,What's he doing?
2073,2073,"Mum, why is he slowing down?"
2074,2074,...the second and third place Fords to close ranks.
2075,2075,The three Fords are going to cross the line together.
2076,2076,Ken Miles slowed down.
2077,2077,He waited for them.
2078,2078, Here are the Fords lined up in a row...
2079,2079, Dad. No.
2080,2080, It's all right.
2081,2081, Dad.
2082,2082,It's all right.
2083,2083,"Look, he's bringing them in."
2084,2084, Led by Ken Miles...
2085,2085, He's bringing them all in together.
2086,2086,...certainly the leader of this group  and owner of the Le Mans lap record...
2087,2087, Good for you.
2088,2088, ...set just moments ago.
2089,2089," Good for you, Ken."
2090,2090,Yeah! Yeah!
2091,2091,Look at that.
2092,2092," Well done, Leo."
2093,2093," You too, Don."
2094,2094,Please stand by.
2095,2095,Final results are under review.
2096,2096,...is explain to me how he's finished first and he's not won the race?
2097,2097,"Because McLaren started from further, so he came in..."
2098,2098,he won.
2099,2099,"Look, it's not a tie."
2100,2100,"No, because McLaren..."
2101,2101,"Because McLaren started further back, he's saying he's traveled that little bit further, so he's won and not Ken."
2102,2102,That is bullshit.
2103,2103,That's bullshit.
2104,2104,Shel! Hold on!
2105,2105, Where's the tie?
2106,2106," Hey, hey, hey."
2107,2107,Where's the goddamn tie?
2108,2108,What?
2109,2109, You son of a bitch!
2110,2110," Hey, Shelby!"
2111,2111, You knew!
2112,2112," No, I didn't know!"
2113,2113, That's enough! Enough!
2114,2114, Get off me! Hey!
2115,2115,Bruce.
2116,2116,"Nice race, mate. Congrats."
2117,2117,Shel!
2118,2118,"They robbed you, Ken."
2119,2119,Here is the clarification.
2120,2120,"Though the drivers finished the race in a heat, McLaren has been ruled the winner as he started from farther back."
2121,2121,Some bullshit technicality.
2122,2122,"Final results. Ford number 2, driven by McLaren and Amon, is the winner."
2123,2123,"Ford number 1, driven by Miles and Hulme, second place."
2124,2124,"In third place, Bucknum and Hutcherson in Ford number 5."
2125,2125,I never should've asked you.
2126,2126,"Selling cars, huh?"
2127,2127,That's what they do.
2128,2128,"Well, you promised me the drive."
2129,2129,Not the win.
2130,2130,It was a hell of a drive.
2131,2131,She's a hell of a machine.
2132,2132,"Oh, she's fast."
2133,2133,Could be faster.
2134,2134,The 7 liter's sweet...
2135,2135,"but, uh..."
2136,2136,we still need a lighter chassis.
2137,2137,I was thinking bonded aluminium.
2138,2138,"It's a groundup rebuild, but if it works..."
2139,2139,we can lose a couple hundred pounds.
2140,2140,"Well, what the hell are we doing here?"
2141,2141,"Let me take a shower, get a cup of tea..."
2142,2142,ham and cheese cob or something.
2143,2143,We're gonna get the bastards next year.
2144,2144,Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.
2145,2145,What do you think of those honeycomb panels?
2146,2146,What you were looking for?
2147,2147,Don't know yet.
2148,2148,She looks pretty good.
2149,2149,"There's a point at 7,000 RPM..."
2150,2150,where everything fades.
2151,2151,The machine becomes weightless.
2152,2152,Just disappears.
2153,2153,Yeah!
2154,2154,And all that's left is a body...
2155,2155,moving through space and time.
2156,2156,"7,000 RPM."
2157,2157,That's where you meet it.
2158,2158,You feel it coming.
2159,2159,"It creeps up on you, close in your ear."
2160,2160,Asks you a question.
2161,2161,The only question that matters.
2162,2162,Get the van!
2163,2163,"""Who are you?"" What do you think?"
2164,2164,It's fantastic.
2165,2165,Feels really good.
2166,2166,Nice and smooth.
2167,2167,No vibration in the box.
2168,2168,Feels really strong.
2169,2169,You drove it for less than an hour.
2170,2170,You can't tell shit after an hour.
2171,2171,"Go for seven even, that'd be 14 all in."
2172,2172,"Hey, Shel."
2173,2173,"Hey, Shel, that guy, you know the one in the hat, he's ready to close on those two 427s."
2174,2174,His and hers. Full freight.
2175,2175,"They, uh, flew in from Galveston."
2176,2176,Uhhuh.
2177,2177,"Uh, I need you to come outside for maybe a minute."
2178,2178,And do what?
2179,2179,Be Carroll Shelby.
2180,2180,"Tell them a story, spin a few magic words."
2181,2181,What does that mean?
2182,2182,"""Magic words""?"
2183,2183,It means...
2184,2184,come outside and say hello and make them feel good about their purchase.
2185,2185,They're getting the damn cars.
2186,2186,"That's what they get for their money, Phil."
2187,2187,"Now, either they want 'em or they don't."
2188,2188, Am I some kind of a lounge act?
2189,2189, No.
2190,2190,Am I here to talk people into things?
2191,2191,"It's been six months, Shel."
2192,2192,Six months.
2193,2193,Sometimes they don't get out of the car.
2194,2194,Peter!
2195,2195,"Peter, come and take the garbage out."
2196,2196,Mr. Shelby.
2197,2197,"Oh, hello, Pete."
2198,2198,I remember that wrench.
2199,2199,My dad threw it at you.
2200,2200,I believe he did.
2201,2201,Why?
2202,2202,Oh.
2203,2203,I think I probably said something to him.
2204,2204,Called him a few names.
2205,2205,That's right.
2206,2206,Do you wanna speak to my mum?
2207,2207,"Well, I did. Uh..."
2208,2208,"I came to say hello, check in on her and..."
2209,2209,Then I started thinking that sometimes...
2210,2210,"uh, words..."
2211,2211,just... arare not useful.
2212,2212,Tools are useful 'cause you can make stuff with 'em and you can fix stuff with 'em.
2213,2213,Here.
2214,2214,Thanks.
2215,2215,"Your daddy was, uh..."
2216,2216,He was your friend.
2217,2217,"Yes, he was."
2218,2218,"Yes, sir."
2219,2219,And he thought you was just finer than frog fur.
2220,2220,Peter!
2221,2221,I think I've gotta go help my mum.
2222,2222,What are you doing here then?
2223,2223,Go on.
2224,2224,Bye.
