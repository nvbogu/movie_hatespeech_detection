1220,1220,"Thank you, Muek."
1221,1221,"Ah, Lisiek."
1222,1222,"Don't touch the leather, it's just been oiled."
1223,1223,Rottenfuehrer.

1225,1225,"Oh, thank you very much, Herr Direktor. Thank you."

1227,1227,Herr Direktor.!
1228,1228,Herr Direktor.!
1229,1229,He was making hinges slowly.

1231,1231,Why the long story ? Hmm ?
1232,1232," Machines Rumbling  Thank you, sir."
1233,1233,You're welcome.
1234,1234,"Nobody knows who stole the chicken, hmm ?"
1235,1235,Tell him about the chicken.
1236,1236,A man walks around with a chicken and nobody notices this.
1237,1237,Save yourselves.
1238,1238,Tell him about the chicken.
1239,1239,Still nobody knows.
1240,1240, Sobbing  It was you.
1241,1241,You committed this crime.
1242,1242,"No, sir."
1243,1243,"But you know who, though."

1250,1250,"Yes, sir."
1251,1251,Thank you.
1252,1252,"Thank you again, Herr Direktor."
1253,1253,You're welcome again.
1254,1254,It's an honor to work for such a great company.
1255,1255,It's great to have you.
1256,1256,I promise to learn everything about enamelware production.
1257,1257,That's great.
1258,1258,Hello ?
1259,1259,Miss Elsa Krause is here.
1260,1260,I only need five minutes.
1261,1261,She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.
1262,1262, Typewriter Keys Clicking  Yes.
1263,1263,He won't see you.
1264,1264,"Please, sit down."
1265,1265,Pernod ?
1266,1266,Cognac ?
1267,1267,"Uh, no."
1268,1268,"So, what can I do for you ?"
1269,1269, Nervous Chuckle  They say that no one dies here.
1270,1270,They say your factory is a haven.
1271,1271,They say you are good.
1272,1272,Who says that ?
1273,1273,Everyone.
1274,1274,"My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause."
1275,1275,I've been living in Krakow on false papers since the ghetto massacre.
1276,1276,My parents are in Plaszow.
1277,1277,Their names are Chana and Jakob Perlman.
1278,1278,They are older people.
1279,1279,They are killing older people now in Plaszow.
1280,1280,They bury them up in the forest. Look...
1281,1281, Sighs  I don't have any money.
1282,1282,"I, I borrowed these clothes."
1283,1283,I'm begging you.
1284,1284,"Please, please bring them here."
1285,1285,I don't do that.
1286,1286,You've been misled.
1287,1287,I ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills.
1288,1288,"My father is an importer, not a metalworker."
1289,1289, Continues Arguing  Such activities are illegal.
1290,1290,You will not entrap me !
1291,1291,"Cry, and I will have you arrested."
1292,1292,I swear to God !
1293,1293," Mutters, Sobbing  People die."
1294,1294,It's a fact of life.
1295,1295,He wants to kill everybody ?
1296,1296,Great ! What am I supposed to do about it ?
1297,1297,Bring everybody over ?
1298,1298,Is that what you think ?
1299,1299,Send them over to Schindler.
1300,1300,Send them all !
1301,1301,"His place is a haven, didn't you know ?"
1302,1302,It's not a factory.
1303,1303,It's not an enterprise of any kind.
1304,1304,It's a haven for rabbis and orphans...
1305,1305,and people with no skills whatsoever !
1306,1306, Sighs  You think I don't know what you're doing ?
1307,1307,You're so quiet all the time.
1308,1308,"I know, I know !"
1309,1309,Are you losing money ?
1310,1310,That's not the point !
1311,1311,What other point is It's dangerous !
1312,1312,It's dangerous to me !
1313,1313,You have to understand.
1314,1314,Goeth is under enormous pressure.
1315,1315,You have to think of it in his situation.
1316,1316,He's got this whole place to run.
1317,1317,"He's responsible for everything here, all these people."
1318,1318,He's got a lot of things to worry about.
1319,1319,And he's got the war which brings out the worst in people.
1320,1320,"Never the good, always the bad."
1321,1321,Always the bad.
1322,1322,But in normal circumstances he wouldn't be like this.
1323,1323,He'd be all right.
1324,1324,There'd just be the good aspects of him which  Chuckles  He's a wonderful crook.
1325,1325,"A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money Killing."
1326,1326,He can't enjoy it.
1327,1327,"Bejski told me the other day, somebody escaped..."
1328,1328,from a work detail outside the wire.
1329,1329, Gunshots  Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man's barracks.
1330,1330,"He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right ofhim."
1331,1331,He walked down the line shooting every other man with the pistol.
1332,1332,Twentyfive.
1333,1333,What do you want me to do about it ?
1334,1334,"Nothing, nothing."
1335,1335,We're just talking.
1336,1336,''Perlman.''  Shouting  Perlman !
1337,1337,Husband and wife.
1338,1338,Jakob and Chana Perlman !

1342,1342,"  Drunken Singing In German  I'm sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek."
1343,1343,"Herr Direktor, I was just helping Lisiek to find something..."
1344,1344,to clean the stains from the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.
1345,1345,"Go, please."
1346,1346,"Pardon me, Herr Direktor."
1347,1347," Chuckles  You don't have to report to me, Helen."
1348,1348,You know who I am ?
1349,1349,Hmm ?
1350,1350, Whispering  I'm Schindler.
1351,1351,Of course.
1352,1352,II have heard and...
1353,1353,you have been here before.
1354,1354,"Here, why don't you keep this someplace ?"
1355,1355,"Go on, take it."
1356,1356,I get extra food here.
1357,1357,"Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it."
1358,1358,Or give it to Lisiek.
1359,1359,Why not build yourself up ?
1360,1360,"My first day here, he beat me..."
1361,1361,because I threw out the bones from dinner.
1362,1362,"He came down to the basement at midnight, and he he asked me where they were."
1363,1363,"For his dogs, you understand."
1364,1364,"I said to him, I I don't know how I say this."
1365,1365,"I never could say it now I said to him, ''Why are you beating me ?'' He said, ''The reason I beat you now..."
1366,1366,"is because you ask why I beat you.'' I know your sufferings, Helen."
1367,1367,It doesn't matter.
1368,1368,I have accepted them.
1369,1369,Accepted them ?
1370,1370,One day he will shoot me.
1371,1371,"No, no, no, no, he won't shoot you."
1372,1372,I know.
1373,1373,I see things.
1374,1374,"We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I, and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door..."
1375,1375,and down the steps by the patio right there below us and and there on the steps he drew his gun and he...
1376,1376,shot a woman who was passing by.
1377,1377,A woman carrying a bundle.
1378,1378,Through the throat.
1379,1379,"Just Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know."
1380,1380,She was no fatter or thinner...
1381,1381,"or slower or faster than anyone else, and I couldn't guess what had she done."
1382,1382,"The more you see of the Herr Kommandant, the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by."
1383,1383,"You can't say to yourself, ''If I follow these rules, I will be safe.'' He won't shoot you because he enjoys you too much."
1384,1384,He enjoys you so much he won't even let you wear the star.
1385,1385,He doesn't want anyone else to know...
1386,1386,it's a Jew he's enjoying.
1387,1387,He shot the woman from the steps...
1388,1388,because she meant nothing to him.
1389,1389,"She was one of a series, neither offending or pleasing him."
1390,1390,"But you, Helen."
1391,1391,It's all right.
1392,1392,It's not that kind of a kiss.
1393,1393, Sobbing  Thank you.
1394,1394,Shh.
1395,1395,Here.
1396,1396,Right. The wine.
1397,1397,"Wonderful party, Amon."
1398,1398,Thank you.
1399,1399, Groans  Why do you drink that motor oil ?
1400,1400,Hmm ? I send you good stuff all the time.
1401,1401,Your liver's going to explode like a hand grenade.
1402,1402,The more I look at you  Sniffs  I watch you.
1403,1403, Sighs  You're never drunk.
1404,1404," Sniffs  Oh, that's that's real control."
1405,1405,Control is power.
1406,1406,That's power.
1407,1407, Schindler  Is that why they fear us ?
1408,1408,"We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us."
1409,1409,They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.
1410,1410,"A man commits a crime, he should know better."
1411,1411,"We have him killed, and feel good about it."
1412,1412,Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.
1413,1413,"That's not power, though."
1414,1414,That's justice.
1415,1415,It's different than power.
1416,1416,Power is when we have every justification to kill...
1417,1417,and we don't.
1418,1418,You think that's power ?
1419,1419,That's what the emperors had.
1420,1420,"A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy."
1421,1421,He knows he's going to die.
1422,1422,And the emperor...
1423,1423,pardons him.
1424,1424,This worthless man.
1425,1425,He lets him go.
1426,1426,I think you are drunk.
1427,1427,"That's power, Amon."
1428,1428,That... is power.
1429,1429,Amon the Good.

1529,1529,"You know, if they were there, they would have been gassed."
1530,1530,Yes.
1531,1531,It doesn't make any sense.
