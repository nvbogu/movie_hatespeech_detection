70,70," I grew up as a little white boy in America in the 1950s in a middleclass home, so I have nothing to complain about."
71,71,I feel like anybody who grew up in that situation has it better than most medieval kings because we had aspirin and some people had air conditioning.
72,72, I'm one of those guys that was fortunate to have like an idyllic childhood.
73,73,My family was as normal as they could get.
74,74,"I was forced to go to a fairly fundamental church for the first 18 years of my life, so that probably had some effect on why I rebelled so strongly once I got away from my folks."
75,75, I can't say that I'm rebelling against my religious upbringing or anything like that because I didn't really have one.
76,76,I was raised basically secular humanist scientist.
77,77,"This is Fort Worth, Texas."
78,78,I was surrounded by Baptists.
79,79,I really did feel like a weirdo.
80,80,"Kids would go, ""Hey, Doug, where's you family go to church?"" I didn't even know the name of a single church."
81,81,I'd really be stuck.
82,82,"I'd say things like, ""Oh, the mumbles."" indistinct room chatter Philo I was very much into comic books and any kind of alternate publications and music like Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart and people that were not mainstream."
83,83,Ivan I did not feel like my classmates.
84,84,"Despite my very fun childhood, I had terrible teenage years."
85,85,I had to hang around the theater department in order to meet girls.
86,86,"That's how I met my first wife, in fact."
87,87,Philo I was discouraged from participating in art.
88,88,Art was not a place where you can make money.
89,89,You need to get a real type job.
90,90,So I worked for AT&T and that's kind of like where my inside to The Conspiracy took place.
91,91," My sisterinlaw, she said, ""I have these friends ""Philo and Cookie that I met that you should meet them, they've just moved to Dallas."" I said, ""I don't want to meet any friends."
92,92,"I don't need friends."" Said, ""No, you might like this guy."
93,93,"He collects comic books and he likes Captain Beefheart."" I thought, what?!"
94,94,Both comic books and Captain Beefheart?!
95,95,Philo We just became great friends.
96,96,He was the liberal.
97,97,"I was the conservative, but we were both so disaffected with politics."
98,98,We didn't believe any of it was true.
99,99," What we really had in common was collecting, well, what we might call kook pamphlets or extremist literature of religious or political cards."
100,100,You'd go to a laundromat and there would be The Watchtower from Jehovah's Witnesses or a comic book from Chick Publications.
101,101,"You know, ""This Was Your Life""."
102,102,We loved the range of ridiculous things that human beings can convince themselves of.
103,103," If I went out and made my daily quota, the first thing I'd do is go over and wake up Reverend Stang and say, ""Let's get up."
104,104,"""Let's go do something."
105,105,"Let's have some fun.""  We were trolls before they had that term."
106,106,"The internet hadn't been invented, but CB radios had and Philo, because he had a real job, had a CB radio..."
107,107,but we didn't use it to help the world.
108,108,We used it to puzzle and confuse strangers.
109,109,"We would get on and say things like, alienlike ""Men of earth, men of Earth, ""we are speaking to you from away in space.""  ""Come in pink boy,"" remember?"
110,110, Well there were these two guys that were doing it back to us.
111,111,"They were trolling us and they were saying, ""Shut up pink boy, shut up pink boy."" And we interpreted that as, ""Oh, the aliens are finally talking to him."
112,112,"And that was what they had to say."" The next thing we knew, pink boys were everybody we didn't like: bosses, rude waiters, nasty clerks in stores."
113,113,We were surrounded by dumb asses.
114,114,"We knew that we were dumb asses too, but we felt like it was a matter of degrees."
115,115,"Philo People that we didn't want to have anything to do with, the pinks and the mediocritines, the techno glorps."
116,116,"Stang Part of me was in terror of all of that, but there was also the terrible stress of having to, you know, make the living and not lose your soul."
117,117,"At some point, one of us said something like, ""Why aren't we rich yet?"
118,118,"We've got all these skills and things."" And Philo goes, ""Well, I guess we're not geniuses."
119,119,"We're really just subgeniuses."" And in my head, everything fell together like a puzzle box."
120,120,A Rubik's Cube suddenly formed itself.
121,121,"A weird fringe cult for weirdos, specifically for weirdos."
122,122,That was the Church of the SubGenius.
123,123,"Philo When we did the first pamphlet, it was really a labor of love."
124,124,"The pasting up, the cutting."
125,125,Stang We tied together every fringe belief you could think of.
126,126,"It was like getting all your toys, your dinosaur toys, and your army men toys and your cowboy and Indian toys, putting them all together on the floor and having this whole world that was a conglomerate of all the cool stuff ever."
127,127,It was so much fun!
128,128,"Philo We had this sort of an icon we can blame everything on, the conspiracy of normalcy."
129,129,"Stang There's Bob, The Conspiracy and Slack."
130,130,"If you're going to have a cult, you have to have a cult leader."
131,131,"Well, that's Bob."
132,132, We need to put a face to that entity.
133,133, We can't afford artwork.
134,134,"No, this clip art, this public domain stuff."
135,135,"It's old, nobody cares about it."
136,136," As we flip through the catalog, there was that face."
137,137,"Stang We both instantly knew, that's Bob."
138,138,"After a couple of months, we had assembled SubGenius pamphlet number one."
139,139," When the printing bill came in on the first pamphlet, it was $60."
140,140,My wife got very upset with that.
141,141,You're going to have to send these to publishers.
142,142,We can't afford that kind of thing.
143,143,You need to try to turn it into a book or something.
144,144,"Publishers, wow, okay."
145,145,I got Writer's Digest and got the addresses of every publisher in the United States and mailed the pamphlet to them.
146,146,We've got 150 rejection slips back.
147,147,The rest of them didn't say anything.
148,148," I was living in San Francisco, working with my colleague partner, Gilbert Shelton at Rip Off Press."
149,149,"I wandered into the publisher's office, and a fellow named Fred, and he opened some envelope up and pulled out the initial pamphlet."
150,150,He grumbled something about it and threw it in the trash can next to his desk.
151,151,"To his complete irritation, I pulled it out and started laughing at it."
152,152,It was the funniest thing I've ever read.
153,153,"It was good to, like how refreshing."
154,154,"I think my first act was to get an envelope and put all the cash I had in my wallet and it wrote a note saying, ""Send me more pamphlets.""  The first pamphlet, pamphlet number one, is a significant document in many ways."
155,155,It is the vector by which many people have had their most significant introduction to the Church of the SubGenius.
156,156," Doug sent a pamphlet to KPFA and so I saw that and really loved it and for years, since I was a kid, I've been putting stuff in the mail to strangers, so they became new strangers."
157,157,They start mailing stuff back.
158,158,"It was like the internet really, but instead of a thousand people, it was 10 or 15 of us."
159,159,It was really fun.
160,160, It was such a seminal little pamphlet; it was almost like a test of your mindset like were you a SubGenius or not?
161,161,"If you got it, you were a SubGenius."
162,162,Nurse Kelly It really spoke to me.
163,163,It had this whole thing about how the goal is Slack and the motto is fuck them if they can't take a joke.
164,164," The central doctrine more than anything else in the Church of SubGenius of course, is this Slack thing."
165,165," It's probably one of the hardest things to describe in the church, you know."
166,166, We don't describe it because by definition Slack is really different for each person.
167,167,"Margaret Slack is what everybody wants, it's what we still want."
168,168,Nurse Kelly This idea of a place where people can live where they don't feel harried by just the multiple things that one feels harried by all the time.
169,169, You know when you don't have it.
170,170, That's for sure.
171,171,Paul It was like finding likeminded people.
172,172,If you could truly say any of us had minds to be alike.
173,173,"Somebody with the same type of cynical perspective, same reference points."
174,174,Margaret They were so layered in everything.
175,175,"It was, it was part pop culture, part science, part religion."
176,176,"So it appealed to me a great deal and I did do just as it said, I sent a dollar with the letter."
177,177, What's that say?
178,178,Send a dollar?
179,179,Even I've got a dollar.
180,180,So I sent off a dollar and I got this little pamphlet and that was where the crushing loneliness started to get chipped away.
181,181," I was doing a magazine called Famous Potatoes using a lot of ads and clip art stuff and it was a fine artist, Robert Williams who said, ""Hey, you ought to send some stuff off to the Church of the SubGenius."
182,182,"They're doing a bunch of clip art stuff like you do."" So I sent stuff off and I think it arrived just after Stang's birthday or something, and he just flipped out over the Famous Potatoes and he sent me all the pack and I didn't have to pay."
183,183," There was a flyer on a phone pole that said, ""Get ready for a pretty tough future, what scientists are afraid to tell us."" And then there was a picture of Bob."
184,184,"I showed it to all my pals and they were like, ""yeah, yeah."" So we didn't send them a dollar, we sent him $100 from Little Rock and we got the first pamphlet back."
185,185,That just Bobbed us all up immediately.
186,186, It was a little bit of a sense that there are other people interested in these things.
187,187,"They might be far away and they might exist from post office box to post office box, but they are out there."
188,188,"Susie It was intoxicating to think that there was somewhere where you didn't have to fit in, where people were crazy in the good way."
189,189,So I sent in my 10 bucks and I became a SubGenius.
190,190,"Philo We got the first few orders coming in, remember we were so excited and then all of a sudden  Terrified more like it was like, what?"
191,191,"Somebody actually sent us $10, now we really have to do that newsletter."
192,192, Now we actually had to start working and doing stuff.
193,193, Hey Reverend Stang?
194,194,Stang Huh?
195,195, Another gun.
196,196," We said, you've got a religion, now you've got to have the tent revivals."
197,197,"You know, you can't just say you have religion."
198,198,You have to have this gathering of the faithful.
199,199, It was a sad day for mankind.
200,200,"It was a sad day for mankind when man stopped, started sticking with his head and walking on his feet, the kind with fourlegged backup."
201,201,"Awww, yeah, I can feel it emanating."
202,202,I can feel its eyes just burning into my eye.
203,203,I can feel a man staring at me and screaming at me and threaten his eyebrows.
204,204,I can feel that man saying he wants to testify to Bob.
205,205,Philo A devival is a SubGenius revival.
206,206,It didn't sound good to say revival.
207,207,Devival sounds a lot better.
208,208,It actually sounds kind of like devil.
209,209,Stang They were a way for us to act as if we were rock and roll stars or preachers or something.
210,210," Thank you Bob, âª for closing my memory."
211,211,Stang I was the one who was supposed to get up on stage and do stuff and I actually had terrible stage fright.
212,212,I wasn't interested in that at all.
213,213,"But a Dallas character who later ended up calling himself Reverend Buck Nakid, the SubGenius thing really clicked with him."
214,214, The word crime is serving the conspiracy and the penalty.
215,215,And the penalty...
216,216,Stang He was ready to get up on stage and preach.
217,217, The penalty is worse than having your gonads cut off.
218,218,The penalty is worse than having your head cut off.
219,219,"Stang Eventfully, I didn't really like the way Buck did it."
220,220, And the rest of them are wrong and you're only one that's right.
221,221,That's how you're supposed to feel  So I started doing it.
222,222,"Before we start the services, we should have a just a moment of, a moment of sacred noise."
223,223,"screaming Thanks to the SubGenius thing, I discovered I wasn't alone."
224,224,There were weirdos all over the place.
225,225,"Margaret They were very normal people who just talked nutty stuff about the Church of the SubGenius, which made them very easy to relate to and get along with."
226,226,"Byron I remember seeing all these bands and stuff and I thought, you know, These guys are loaded, these guys are drunk."
227,227,Then I saw Doctors for Bob perform and I thought these guys are clinically insane.
228,228, Antimusic is a concept of unfettered expression musically and sonically to try to create this sound that trained hands can't do.
229,229,You have to go totally on instinct and that's what we did with Doctors for Bob.
230,230, It was kind of this Looney Tunes fraternity and you had to kind of enjoy guys to be a part of it.
231,231,The way that I viewed the Church and the SubGenius is that in a way it is the patriarchy strained through cheese cloth.
232,232, It was a boy's club and I was attracted to it because I wanted to meet the boys.
233,233, It is divinely taking itself by the hair and turning itself inside out and looking at the world with fresh eyes and that's why it's such a special place for special people doing special things having special feelings and we have to put up with.
234,234,"cheers and applause I think it was this way of saying it's them and not you, you know."
235,235,"Don't you worry if the world or The Conspiracy is getting you down, you come stand by me cause you're one of ours."
236,236," The Conspiracy's major efforts is to take your Slack away and to sell you a false version of it, which they manufacture."
237,237," Well, I'm afraid we all discovered The Conspiracy probably our first day of school when the other kids made fun of you for using the wrong color crayon or you're not doing it right."
238,238, It was important that we encapsulate everybody's best enemy into something that could be easily distilled into one thing.
239,239,"Something that people could say, ""Yeah, I understand that, we're all victims of that.""  Anything that bothers you is the Conspiracy."
240,240,"It's a little bit, the thing that assassinates presidents from both depository libraries."
241,241,"It's a little bit the suppressed saucer technology that is owned by the European union, but it's also just when it's too hot on the bus."
242,242," In 1953, Jehovah I, the alien space god informed Bob Dobbs that there was this conspiracy of normal people robbing the Slack of the SubGeniuses for centuries."
243,243,"But that on July 5th, 1998 at precisely 7:00 AM, the men from planet X would come rupture up to these paying believing SubGeniuses and give them the power to wreak revenge on all the normals."
244,244,"Next thing you know, you've got the doctrine for an entire religion."
245,245,Oh yes.
246,246,Bob can set free the winos.
247,247,He can set free the prisoners.
248,248,Do we have any more testimonials from the crowd?
249,249, I found the image of Bob's head in a bed pan and ever since it's just been Bob all the way.
250,250, Saved by the image of Bob in a bed pan.
251,251,"Our tendency is to just let everybody throw in, so we don't really have any rules."
252,252, I was once a degenerate but Bob saved me.
253,253, Amen.
254,254,Amen!
255,255,We encourage people to form their own schism.
256,256,"You know, join the church and send us money, but immediately rebel against it."
257,257," Well, there's always a split in the church and if there wasn't, we'd create some because you can't have a church without schisms and the more schisms in a cult, the better."
258,258," Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to inject this campground with some real hate."
259,259,cheers I would like to bring to you the great Papa Joe Mama.
260,260,"cheers Joe Mama One of the major magnets of religion isn't the common love of something, it's the common hatred of something."
261,261,That's what brings everybody together.
262,262,"So, I just wanted to offer that sort of alter ego, the sort of antiBob, if you will, and the Church of the SubGenius."
263,263,"There are two distinct branches in the Church of the SubGenius, the highbrow, Ivangelical branch, led by Ivan Stang and his philosophical followers."
264,264,Stang Some of the SubGeniuses were looking at me as kind of the dogooder.
265,265,I was a little too easy on the normals.
266,266,I didn't really want to destroy the whole world.
267,267,"I just wanted to loot it, get all the good comic books."
268,268,"Well, other people really do hate the normals."
269,269, The Ivangelicals and the Holocaustals represent two sides of the church.
270,270,Now the Ivangelicals believed that all the pinks need to be enslaved and can still serve a purpose after the final judgment in which earth is liberated from the chains of pink and conspiracy rule.
271,271,"Now the Holocaustals, we're kind of a more traditional fundamentalist if you will."
272,272,We believe that you do need to eliminate and exterminate all the normals.
273,273, Not every one of the Churches of the SubGenius gets along with one another cause it's the group for people who can't join groups.
274,274,"I've often tried to explain to people about Church of the SubGenius, these can be very smart, talented people, but somewhere along line they've got a personality problem that keeps them from joining in and being sociable and popular and normal."
275,275,radio distortion Woman on tape I like go to the lake.
276,276,I like to rollerskate and go walking around.
277,277,"Um, I like to do  This character named Doug Wellman using the handle Puzzling Evidence, he was way ahead of us in collaging found sound."
278,278,"indistinct distorted noise Paul Doug Wellman had been making these audio collage tapes with sound effects and improvised, humor as it were."
279,279, It was like a network of people that traded cassette tapes.
280,280, You'd get the tape and you'd listen to the tape and you'd immediately start a tape back to the friend and it was just such a great way to communicate.
281,281,"CoSG tape Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritines, these pink boys, these normals who have made normality the norm?"
282,282," Doug was in Berkeley and I was in San Francisco and we turned on KPFA and heard ourselves on the radio, which was a little moment of discontinuity because how could we be on the radio when we were here listening to it and it turned out this fellow had gotten a hold of one of Doug's tapes and was just filling his show out with them."
283,283,"We contacted him and invited ourself onto his show and at some point that became our Slack, which, you know, was a great name because the show is actually 90 minutes long."
284,284,CoSG Radio Welcome to the SubGenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
285,285, This gave us a body of cassette tapes that made us sound a little more developed than we really were.
286,286,Paul Nobody had met each other to that point.
287,287,No real events or anything.
288,288,It was all just a mail media network.
289,289,"There were finally enough people who were curious about each other and becoming actual friends that we wanted to meet, so we decided we were going to have a convention in Dallas."
290,290, Have you ever wondered about your neighbors?
291,291,Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chants emanating from their apartment?
292,292,"They may be followers of Bob, that's the fastest growing cult here in the Southwest."
293,293,"Stang Somehow or another, Channel 4 News got wind of this SubGenius thing."
294,294,Paul Ivan was really resistant at first.
295,295,Stang I was married to a schoolteacher.
296,296,"We didn't want to get my wife in trouble or get Philo fired, plus Philo's parents didn't know anything about this whole SubGenius thing."
297,297,They were very religious.
298,298, I didn't ever want to do anything that was going to embarrass them in public.
299,299,"Even though I had this really strong need to rebel, I wanted to kind of do it privately."
300,300,The church is so omnipervasive that we couldn't possibly get into the dogma in any less than three or four hours.
301,301,I thought maybe a secret identity is a good thing.
302,302,News Anchor It's the Church of the SubGenius and they're holding a revival.
303,303," My name is Sternodox from Little Rock, Arkansas."
304,304,"This is Puzzling Evidence representative Doug Wellman from, Oakland, California."
305,305," I'm Paul Mavrides from the LIES foundation in San Francisco, California."
306,306, Deep in the heart of San Francisco.
307,307,Stang People came from all over the country.
308,308, I'm from Houston and I came to learn more about Bob.
309,309, Bob is like a super salesman.
310,310, He can sell you anything and I bought it.
311,311," I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob."
312,312,It would wake me up in the middle of the night.
313,313,I'd wake up doing jumping jacks.
314,314,I wouldn't know why.
315,315, Devo was in town and Mark Mothersbaugh came by.
316,316, It was only by chance that I started receiving mail from the SubGenius Foundation and I realized who Bob was.
317,317, Two of the guys from Devo are at the convention.
318,318,I thought this is really cool.
319,319, Everything was completely like a parallel universe to what Devo had been doing back in Akron and now was trying to foist upon the world.
320,320,"This was big time major, grade A proof positive that it had been going on somewhere else."
321,321, There's a good Bob and there is a bad Bob.
322,322,There's a big tall Bob and there's a little short Bob.
323,323,There's a kitchen Bob and a living room Bob...
324,324,crosstalk Reporter And where is Bob leading them?
325,325," When you first look at it, some people go, ""Oh, I get it."
326,326,"This is a takeoff on weird cults and conspiracies."" Then they look a little bit deeper and if they're really an attuned sort of person, then they realize, ""Oh, I get it."
327,327,"This really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma that I've been needing all my life,"" and that's usually when they write their first check."
328,328," Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas."
329,329," As the song says, different strokes for different folks."
330,330," Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think."
331,331,laughing  I lost my ass on that.
332,332,"It was disastrous for me personally, it hurt my job and probably my marriage."
333,333,Philo He was struggling to make money and I have to admit for me that was probably the time in my life when I had the least amount of trouble earning an income.
334,334, I was in the perfect position of being desperate enough to do low budget promotion for a weird cult.
335,335,Philo Stark Fist...
336,336,That's a lot of weird shit.
337,337, It certainly is.
338,338," I kicked in a few bucks now and then, for the most part he was the guy that was shelling out his money."
339,339, Now you should make a film about slave labor in the SubGenius church.
340,340, That's what I'm doing.
341,341, Yeah.
342,342, I was kidnapped in my native country of Africa walking down the street and these five people came up and told me to get over here to American and fold these damn envelope.
343,343, It was like a carrot was being dangled in front of me personally all the time.
344,344,This thing could be big.
345,345, We were aware that we were sort of influencing other of the people.
346,346,That was exciting.
347,347,"You didn't know who, but you could kind of tell other people were like, ""What's that Bob thing you're doing?"" Linklater I kind of wish I had found the Church of the SubGenius when I was a teenager living in East Texas, a little town where the state prison was and it was nothing but Baptist churches everywhere, which my family didn't go to."
348,348,So we were sort of the oddballs.
349,349, What do you do to earn a living?
350,350, You mean work?
351,351,To hell with the kind of work you have to do to earn a living.
352,352,All that does is fill the bellies of the pigs who exploit us.
353,353," They look at you and say, ""Oh, you're not getting anything done."
354,354,"""You're a bum."
355,355,"""You're a slacker."
356,356,"You're disengaged,"" all the put downs that people throw at people who seem to be living their own lives, who kind of following their own passions."
357,357,Interviewer What is this?
358,358,Some kind of a psychic TV type parallel...
359,359," Well, we all know the psychic powers of the televised image, but we need to capitalize on it and make it work for us instead of us working for it."
360,360,Linklater That's a threat.
361,361,That's a threat to The Conspiracy.
362,362,That's a threat to the mediocrity machine that is the modern capitalist world.
363,363,Philo Other creative people started coming into the church.
364,364,"Penn Jillette There was a guy who owned a record store in Amherst, Massachusetts."
365,365,I think he's the one that told me about the SubGenius.
366,366,I was told at one point that I was the only person who had paid his dues to the SubGenius every single time they asked.
367,367,"The effect they had on David Byrne, the effect they had on The Residents, the effect they had on Paul Reubens."
368,368,Even people who didn't know were building on SubGenius tropes and sensibilities.
369,369,Philo It was very flattering.
370,370,Some of these people were like our heroes.
371,371,"So to be recognized by your heroes, it's a real ego boost."
372,372,We actually got big heads and stuff.
373,373,"Stang My sisterinlaw, she'd moved to New York and was in the publishing business."
374,374,"She went to a picnic with a bunch of other people in the publishing business and a young man named Tim McGinnis, who was a brand new editor at McGraw Hill, found this smudged pamphlet on the floor of her car."
375,375,"He goes, ""Where'd this come from?"" She goes, ""Oh it's my crazy brotherinlaw."
376,376,"He and his buddy did this."" He goes, ""I want to get in touch with him."
377,377,"And tell him to get an agent."" Next thing we knew Simon and Schuster, McGraw Hill and MacMillan were all bidding on the book of the SubGenius, which caused the asking price to go up to $20,000."
378,378,That was enough to pay Paul Mavrides and John HaganBrenner to do professional design on it.
379,379," Doug brought in handscrawled manuscripts and packets of clip art and stuff that he wanted included so I'd take a chapter and I'd paste it up, I'd generate some original material."
380,380,Stang John's style was perfect because it kind of matched the clip art.
381,381,"Philo When McGraw Hill first released it, some places we could find it in the religion section, and I thought that was a huge win."
382,382,We got a contract for a book.
383,383,We got it in the stores and it's in the religion section instead of the comedy section.
384,384,It's not next to Doonesbury.
385,385,It's next to the Bible and stuff.
386,386," People go, ""Man, I barely made it through high school, ""but I stumbled upon your book and I realized I'm not the only one."" Penn I got that book."
387,387,I read it beginning to end.
388,388,I absorbed that book.
389,389,I adored that book.
390,390,I love that book.
391,391,"They kept me with, ""I get this, I get this, I get this."
392,392,"""I understand that this is directly from my heart..."
393,393,"""What the fuck are they talking about?"
394,394,"I have no idea what this is.""  This is the word of all mighty Bob..."
395,395,Is the roadmap.
396,396,There is no other book like this book.
397,397,No other word like this word.
398,398," It was these older, wiser miscreants letting us know that indeed, all of these humanmade organizational systems are as flawed as you suspect because they're made by us."
399,399," This was the age of Jim Jones and all kinds of other vampires and psychic parasites out there using religion to establish control of a segment of a confused and desperate population, and there's no shortage of people like that for reasons good and bad and real and imagined."
400,400," It's fascinating to me to look at religious experience, to look at cults, to look at us and them and all this stuff that I passionately disavowed, and then saying to me, which is what the SubGenius did, ""No, no, we know you don't believe in any of this stuff."
401,401,"""We know that us and them is role, ""But we're going to worship Bob Dobbs ""and we're all a congregation and there's the pinks out there ""and there's us in here and we hate them and we love us and won't that be fun for a little while?""  Slack is a gift to the God."
402,402,The Baptist Church did not save you.
403,403,The Catholic Church did not save you.
404,404,The Unification Church did not save you.
405,405,The Jewish Synagogue did not save you.
406,406,"The Church of the SubGenius did not save you, but it was Bob."
407,407,Bob who walked on hot pavements Paul We actually are a religion.
408,408,"You know, uh..."
409,409,that seems like a art piece that seems like a religion that seems like performance art that seems like a joke that seems like a religion.
410,410," Simply because we're involved in something that is funny, we don't believe that for that reason we should be taken any less seriously."
411,411, We started getting invited to things like art museums.
412,412,They thought it was performance art.
413,413,"Paul Ivan Stang was approached by a fellow in San Francisco, wanted to put on a SubGenius party in San Francisco and Zoe pictured some storefront or a loft or something with a hundred people and went, ""Yeah, we'll do that."" And we came back to the second meeting and Tom was all excited."
414,414,He had gone out and rented a for two nights.
415,415, San Francisco tonight is the location of the first international SubGenius World Survival Crusade.
416,416,Paul TV stations picked up on the show.
417,417,"Beirn It all began with the book of the SubGenius and the Church's deity, Bob Dobbs."
418,418, I was preparing tacos one day for my children and...
419,419,Beirn Now Bob  The face appeared and it's Bob.
420,420,Stang The night of Slack show in San Francisco in 1984 was the first time anybody had put any money into a SubGenius show and flew several people from Dallas and other cities into San Francisco and there was even a paid stage manager.
421,421,There were people building sets just for that show.
422,422,About half the people here will have a great time.
423,423,The rest of them will probably run for the exits.
424,424,"Paul The one thing none of us were at that point, and still aren't, are professionals and I knew that nobody had ever been in front of an audience as big as the one we were hopefully going to draw."
425,425," I remember Friday night going out around the corner of the Victoria Theater and the line went out, up to Mission and around the corner; I almost threw up because I thought, ""We're not showman, these people are paying $7.50.""  It looked like it was going to be a disaster."
426,426,"As people were coming in, we had a galvanized tub of evillooking KoolAid."
427,427," Some people would come over and they would take it eagerly, the Dixie cups, just like they did in Jonestown and they would drink it and they would come over and say, ""How long till I get off?"" And they thought it was like, acid KoolAid, it was like, ""Oh, about  Of course some people were very nervous."
428,428,"The real question was, is this cyanide or LSD?"
429,429,We made sure it was nonsweetened so we wouldn't kill any diabetics.
430,430,organ music tempo picks up cheers and clapping Philo It was great.
431,431,"It was really the first event where a lot of people got together and said, ""Hey, we're all SubGeniuses,"" rubbing elbows."
432,432, The Night of Slack ran for two nights and was surprisingly successful.
433,433,Stang It was the first show that Bob Dobbs himself ever showed up at.
434,434,We were not expecting that at all.
435,435,"He walked out on stage, and then Puzzling Evidence, Doug Wellman, runs out and shoots him with a hand gun right in front of everybody."
436,436,"indistinct crowd chatter  Oh my God, Bob was killed that night."
437,437,It was so sad.
438,438,"laughing  We were coming from the airport and I got to thinking, if you want to sell a religion, you have to kill the deity."
439,439,That's how you do it.
440,440,So I shot Bob thinking the thing would just take off.
441,441,Stang The audience went berserk.
442,442,But the funny thing was the cops didn't care.
443,443,Nobody cared afterwards.
444,444,People were having drinks.
445,445,The band was dancing on the corpse of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
446,446,chaotic music  It was this chance to just sing and dance and be crazy.
447,447,"It was really, really, really, really fun."
448,448, Science does not remove the terror of the gods.
449,449,We can't do much about those evil gods from the other side of the cosmos.
450,450,"But enough of this, you don't want to hear about this."
451,451,Who is the right hand man of Bob?
452,452,Who sits on the right hand side of Bob?
453,453,None other than the Reverend Ivan Stang.
454,454,cheers and applause cheers and applause  I'm not here to talk about the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.
455,455, One of the things that we liked to talk about was how the Church of the SubGenius would allow you to control your own time.
456,456, Can we have the house lights up a little bit?
457,457, We decided to have our producer be our plant in the audience.
458,458, There's a main doctrine of the church called time control.
459,459,Many people don't want it.
460,460,Will you take your watch off?
461,461,audience laughing It's a nice watch.
462,462,"audience laughing Paul Then before he presumably could be stopped, Ivan put the watch down on the concrete block and not just smashed the watch, but broke the concrete block into pieces."
463,463, Time control.
464,464,It is time control.
465,465,You've got to be willing to kill everything in your previous life.
466,466,Paul And then what happened was the unexpected.
467,467,"We were going to move on to the next thing, but people in the audience suddenly ran up to us and started taking their watches off and throwing them on stage."
468,468,"Some of them were really nice watches, but the audience demanded that we smashed them all."
469,469,audience cheering Doug had to sit up there and smashing one after another.
470,470,So there it was.
471,471,The audience was ready to take it way beyond what we were doing.
472,472, Praise Bob!
473,473,Praise Bob!
474,474,Wellman I thought this thing goes farther than I ever imagined.
475,475," We had run for the exits, but only in order to get you this report on time tonight."
476,476,"However, if you're the kind of person who likes to pull the wool over your own eyes, church is in session again tomorrow at 8:00 PM."
477,477," That was an amazing evening and also, I met my first crazy SubGenius."
478,478,This was the first person I ran into who took it all the wrong way.
479,479,He came up to me after that second show and he was livid.
480,480,"""The people in Dallas that did this thing, and Bob, ""when they find out you're just making a Sonny and Cher ""Comedy Show out of it, they're going to kill you."
481,481,"""This is terrible."
482,482,"""Look in this book here it says, ""stop what you're doing right now."
483,483,"""This is serious."
484,484,"""This is not a fan club."
485,485,"This is not a joke."" And I said, ""Dude, I wrote all that stuff."
486,486,"""Me and Philo got high one night and we wrote all this crap."
487,487,"Give me a break."" It really shook me up."
488,488,Philo It was a little bit scary.
489,489,We realized some crazy people are attracted to this.
490,490,"You know the ones that are like, ""Where's Bob?"
491,491,"No, where's the real Bob?""  I think what starts off like a joke, a few kind of believers who want their life to have a little more meaning than it does or they feel it does and then they get a little too gungho."
492,492,They want to adhere a little too much.
493,493,"They start believing a little too much, and then here we go."
494,494,"Penn You are playing with fire and the idea of taking fire and doing what the SubGenius did, which is setting off fireworks."
495,495,It's really beautiful.
496,496,It's really fun.
497,497,"And every second of that, just a little bit of gasoline and it'll tear your face off."
498,498," There are religions that were originally intended to be jokes and then they turned into gangs, you know, into mafias."
499,499," I'm here to offer you an opportunity to know the truth so that if you can connect with it, then you might survive."
500,500, It's a kind of horrifying moment when we realized that we could probably pick up from anywhere who had pledged their lives to us if we asked them to.
501,501,"screaming  I suspect that some of the people who call themselves SubGenius were actually replacing their childhood religion with this, and that wasn't my world view, but when I saw people do that, it was a little scary."
502,502, I guess I was angry at...
503,503,everyone.
504,504,I'd been treated pretty shitty my entire life by folks.
505,505,Their message appealed to me.
506,506,Paul The traditional exchange is that you take responsibility for them.
507,507,"They want you to tell them what to do, and this was the kind of power we didn't want."
508,508,"It was the exact opposite of what we're aiming for, which was to remove people from that kind of a hook."
509,509,"Stang There are people who really want to join this cult and want it to be everything it says it is, and then when they find out that it's not anything it says it is, they get really mad."
510,510," You've heard our phrase ""fuck them if they can't take a joke."" This is important to us."
511,511," Just when you think you might get a handle on Oh, it's a collaborative network of artists all over the country."
512,512,That's all it is.
513,513,"Oh no, that's not what it is."
514,514,So it's really a secretly sort of a subversive organization.
515,515,"No, no, it's not really that."
516,516,It's just a bunch of drunk guys in Dallas trying to freak people out.
517,517," You either got the joke or you didn't, and you got the joke instantly or you didn't."
518,518," Occasionally people will call us out on that whole ""fuck them if they can't take a joke"" thing or it's like, ""Well that just excuses everything."" No, it's just funny."
519,519, When was the last time you gave a straight answer?
520,520," Well, these are all..."
521,521,We don't care whether they get the joke or not.
522,522,Half of them can't.
523,523, We're trying to make you laugh but also maybe shock you a little bit with our irreverence and you may think it's funny.
524,524,"We hope you do, but if you don't, you shouldn't punish us because we are trying to deliver medicine of a sort and if you can't take the joke, then please go fuck yourself."
525,525," It began in the heart of the Bible Belt in Dallas, Texas, but its membership is spreading across the nation."
526,526,News Anchor Their prophet's name is Bob and their followers are legion.
527,527,Paul Everybody in every mass media liked Church of the SubGenius because it was this crazy thing that they could just inject into their own stream.
528,528,"In the absence of the internet, it was kind of a meme for media."
529,529,"Reporter People, 4,000 of them so far and more every day have already joined up."
530,530,Suddenly the joke has become serious.
531,531," At first it was a joke, but there was something much deeper and more life affirming than I even realize."
532,532, Y'all are out to put down outrageous cult groups.
533,533,What does this mean?
534,534," No, no, this is an outrageous cult group."
535,535,Philo The church was meant to never be mass marketable.
536,536,We never really wanted to have a lot of followers.
537,537, Basically I was a very lonely weirdo in a small Massachusetts town.
538,538,"I finally got a boyfriend who was a member of the church and show me the pamphlets and I said, this is it."
539,539, They imparted into me the values that have gotten me where I am today.
540,540," We got this attention, a lot of attention and I started a fear that this thing's going to get too big."
541,541, What the hell do you think you're doing?
542,542,Dragging your butt through the day selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?
543,543,"There is a simple answer, dear friend."
544,544," I feel like I'm part of something, yeah, I feel like I'm finally being represented by something."
545,545,"Speaker The next president of the United States of Brighton, Mr. Bob Dobbs."
546,546, You have voted by Time Magazine as the fraud of the century.
547,547,Do you get any flak from the folks from mainstream religion?
548,548, Not nearly enough.
549,549,"There was a little wave of people going, ""Oh, they're corporate now."
550,550,"""They're huge."
551,551,"""They're sold out."
552,552,"They're pink now."" Well, not really."
553,553,"Philo Oh, we got Will at just the right time, counting checks."
554,554, Huge wad of cash.
555,555,Philo Here we go again.
556,556,"Reporter Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world."
557,557,Only his predictions are just a little different.
558,558, The men from planet X will arrive to rupture the true believers of geniuses up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
559,559, Why do you do this?
560,560,Stang We offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.
561,561,laughing  Triple your money back.
562,562, Is the world going to end?
563,563,That's what I'm asking you.
564,564,I said do you have a prophecy of doom here for us?
565,565, The world will end for those who deserve it.
566,566," All right, all right."
567,567," Those who  Wait, wait, wait, now we're getting somewhere."
568,568,"All right, so basically here's your deal."
569,569,"For 30 bucks, you don't die at the end of the world."
570,570,"screaming and yelling Stang It occurred to me, this is the fulcrum event of human history."
571,571,This is when we finally get our history back in our own hands.
572,572, What an ass.
573,573, It's time to join the SubGenius Revolution.
574,574,The countdown has begun.
575,575,It's like Christmas.
576,576,"Santa is coming, Santa is coming real soon and we've got the short wave you can tune in and hear Santa delivering his little gifts of death and destruction."
577,577," At X day, you always see all sorts of different people and they all had this kind of common sense of humor, a warped sense of humor, a dark sense of humor and I find dark sense of humor to be the most fascinating type of sense of humor because it's taboo."

702,702," They got the kid back, not because of sanity on the part of the judges, it was because the biological father screwed up so very badly, but for two years, we were in the news."
