16,16,Ammonite.
17,17,It's a broken one.
18,18,It's still a fine specimen.
19,19,"Is there something you wanted, sir?"
20,20,"Sorry. Please, let meintroduce myself, Miss Anning. Roderick Murchison."
21,21,I must confess I'm a little in awe.
22,22,Your reputation is something l've often heard discussed in the Geographical Societyin London.
23,23,"All boys together. Yes, well..."
24,24,Quite.
25,25,"But your insights, your skills, are legendary and I thoughtfor my archaeological tourof the Continent, how could I miss the opportunity to meet you?"
26,26,And here you are.
27,27,At your work.
28,28,I was under the impressionthat fine London gentlemen were no longer interestedin my sea creature relics.
29,29,"Fashion moved on, did it not?"
30,30,Quite. I'm afraid l'm a bit of a late starter.
31,31,"And how could I not want to meet ""The presiding deity of Lyme""?"
32,32,It'd be customary for a gentleman to write to me to make an appointmentbefore arriving unannounced.
33,33," Yes, unforgivable."
34,34, Could you not fiddle with that?
35,35,"Sorry. May I introduce my wife, Mrs. Charlotte Murchison?"
36,36,"Sir, as you can see, I don't excavate larger pieces any more."
37,37,I've seen that particular relic in the British Museum.
38,38,A complete ichthyosaurus.
39,39,Am I correct?
40,40,And that's one of yours?
41,41,It's fascinating.
42,42,"I would love to purchase this ammonite from you, but I must be honest."
43,43,"What I would dearly appreciateis the opportunity to spend some time working with you on the shore, seeing what you see."
44,44,I don't conduct guided tours any more.
45,45,"I'm not a tourist, Miss Anning, I'm a scientist, like you."
46,46,A man of the new world and I'm here to learn all I can from you.
47,47,"And, of course, I am more than happy torecompense you for your time."
48,48,"And, obviously, as it's an inconvenience to yourself, I would be able to pay a premium for a private audience."
49,49,"As well as the purchase of this fine ammonite, of course."
50,50,It's not easy work.
51,51, Good.
52,52, I can't promise we'll find anything.
53,53,Naturally.

79,79,Your mother said I would find you here.

92,92,Coprolite. Very nice.
93,93,I'm not familiar with this type.

110,110,"sighs We can't continue like this, Charlotte. You're like a shadow."
111,111,It simply won't do.
112,112,It's madness for me to expect you to be well enough to accompany me abroad.
113,113,It seems you need more time for your convalescence. Roddy...
114,114,Lyme appears to be the perfect place for you.

122,122,"My wife, Charlotte, she hasn't been at all well of late."
123,123,She suffers...
124,124,"Well, it's mild melancholia, perhaps."
125,125,"The doctor prescribed taking the sea air, but it has been a little slow."
126,126,"I have arranged for her to stay on in Lyme, and although I'm reassured that she will be well cared for, she would be alone."
127,127,I was thinking...
128,128,"hoping, really, what a wonderful opportunity it would be for her to walk out with you."
129,129,Walk out? Yes.
130,130,Walk the shoreline with you.
131,131,Learn from you. I'm not looking for an apprentice.
132,132,"No, of course not. I am in no position to spend my days caring for an invalid."
133,133,"No, and..."
134,134,it wouldn't require you to.
135,135,"You showed me such courtesy yesterday, sharing your knowledge, and I was hoping that you might be able to afford my wife the same generosity."
136,136,"You'll help give her an interest, as it were."

150,150,Let me be clear. I don't want you here.

179,179,"Make sure you keep her warm, but not too hot."
180,180,And cold compresses should help relieve the fever.
181,181,I'll write to her husband and send for her things.

404,404,"Tell me, have you been in correspondence with your Mrs. Murchison recently?"
405,405,She's clever.
406,406,And funny.
407,407,I very much enjoyed her company.
408,408,It pleases me you've struck up a friendship together.
409,409,"I know I hurt you terribly, and I'm deeply sorry for that."
410,410,sighs softly I just wasn't sure I could live up to you.
411,411,Or your expectations of me.
412,412,A small side step could curtail it completely.
413,413,"I wasn't the enemy, but it often felt like I was."
414,414,I tried.
415,415,No.
416,416,I don't think you did.
417,417,Not really.
418,418,You seemed to do everything you could to be distant.
419,419,"Eventually, I just..."
420,420,stopped trying.
421,421,It seems your Mrs. Murchison has been able to...
422,422,unlock something in you that I couldn't.

434,434,I can't believe you're here. How was the journey?
435,435,I wish you would have let me send a carriage.
436,436,sighs It feels a very long way from Lyme.
437,437,chuckles Oh. I had it all planned out.
438,438,"We'd have tea, and then I'd show you, but I just don't think I can wait any longer. Come on!"
439,439,Close your eyes. You must close your eyes or it will ruin everything.
440,440,I don't think I like surprises.chuckles You can open them.
441,441,It's yours.
442,442,Mine? Yes.
443,443,To stay the night?
444,444,"Well, yes, but no."
445,445,Also yours to move into.
446,446,"To live here with me.chuckles Here, I thought you could put your mother's figurines."
447,447,And here you can write your journal.
448,448,"Such a good light, isn't it?"
449,449, But I have my home.
450,450, And in here...
451,451,They're for you. I had them made just for you.
452,452,Feel this one.
453,453,"Oh, and one last thing."
454,454,"My room. So we'll be next to each other, always."
455,455,chuckles You've thought of everything. I hope so.
456,456,I didn't want you to worry about anything.
457,457,"Well, say something."
458,458,Sorry. I really shouldn't... Mary.
459,459,"I wanted to see my relicin the British Museum today, so I should..."
460,460,We'll see it later once we've settled you in.
461,461,I feel... I feel I'm at a great disadvantage.
462,462,Pardon?
463,463,I feel I've been misled.
464,464,I don't think I have... I was invited for a visit.
465,465,And now it seems I've been hoodwinked in some way.
466,466,Mary...
467,467,Why did you not mention all this in your letter?
468,468,I wanted to see the look on your face.
469,469,"You presumed I'd be fitted into your life, here, like one of my relics in your fine glass case."
470,470,"No, of course not. Will you label me, too?"
471,471,"No, that's not what I want."
472,472,That's not what I intended.
473,473,I want this to be different.
474,474,Our different.
475,475,This must make your husband very happy.
476,476, Who cares?
477,477," Oh, please don't make fun of me."
478,478,Roddy is content with his life. Very content.
479,479,"And because of you, he now has a proper interest that takes up most of his time."
480,480,"You make it sound so neat, like I planned it."
481,481,Of course not.
482,482,"Please, why are you doing this?"
483,483,I don't want to go back to the life I had before you.
484,484,"What about my life, Charlotte? My work?"
485,485,I can't bear to think of you suffering out on those beaches in all weathers.
486,486,"And now you'll be free to do your important work, your scientific work."
487,487,You don't understand me.
488,488,No!
489,489,Your proposition makes me feel like some fancy bird in a gilded cage.
490,490,sighs I need to find lodgings for tonight.
491,491,I wish you'd told me before.
492,492,I could have saved the boat fare.
493,493,Mary... Mary!
