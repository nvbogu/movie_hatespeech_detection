832,832,"Tyler Put that on, Zak."
833,833,"Here, brother."
834,834,"I've got it, thank you."
835,835,Tyler He could do it.
836,836,He could put his own shirt on.
837,837,He's 22yearsold.
838,838,"Okay, thank you, I've got it."
839,839, We're good now.

846,846, What happened to his ankle?
847,847,He's showing off because you're here.
848,848, What's wrong with his ankle?
849,849, Nothing's wrong with his ankle.
850,850, What are you doing?
851,851, What are you doing?
852,852," Who are you, even?"
853,853," Who are you, even?"
854,854,You have a young boy with Down syndrome in the middle of nowhere.
855,855,"I'm the one who's been taking care of him, because you can't do it unless you put him in a cage."
856,856,"Okay, um..."
857,857,"look, he needs to be properly taken care of, and that's my job."
858,858,"I'm sorry to break up your little primitive gang,  or whatever's going on..."
859,859, Tyler chuckles ...but this is not Lord of the Flies.
860,860,"You can't just... There's rules, there's regulations."
861,861, Okay.
862,862," He has medication,  there's paperwork."
863,863," Yeah, all right."
864,864,"Well, while you've been doing paperwork, we've been doing something called living,  ain't that right, brother?"
865,865, Zak Yeah.
866,866,Okay.
867,867,Cool.
868,868,chuckles But we're going to go.
869,869," So, thank you."
870,870," No, we're not."
871,871,He's fine where he is.
872,872,sighs May I please speak to you in private?
873,873,"Oh. Oh, like a private party?"
874,874,"Yeah, all right."
875,875," One second, Zak."
876,876," I got water, you want water?"
877,877,Eleanor Right now.
878,878,Tyler Primitive gang.
879,879,"Hell, yeah."
880,880,I like when you put your hair up like that.
881,881,It's nice. Some water?
882,882,"Look, I could have you arrested for kidnapping, okay?"
883,883,"Oh, you're going to have me arrested for kidnapping?"
884,884,How do you figure?
885,885,You can't have me arrested.
886,886,He's a runaway.
887,887,Can't kidnap a runaway.
888,888,"Come on, genius."
889,889,"You said GW, didn't you?"
890,890,I'm sure I could find some reason to arrest you.
891,891,"Hey, let me ask you, what do you want for him?"
892,892,I'm not going to sell him to you.
893,893,"No, no, what do you want for his life? His future?"
894,894,Why are you... You don't know  anything about him.
895,895, You know about the wrestling?
896,896,"Yes, of course I know about the wrestling."
897,897,"All right, so I know something about him, don't I?"
898,898,"So, uh, you're a little late to the party."
899,899,This is what's going on.
900,900,"I made a promise to him, to get him to that wrestling school in Ayden."
901,901, Eleanor Oh.
902,902, Tyler You understand?
903,903,"I gave him my word, and I ain't gonna back down on my word."
904,904,"Now, you seem like a nice person."
905,905,You care for him and all.
906,906,You came all the way out here.
907,907,Maybe it's because you like me.
908,908,I don't know.
909,909,"And, uh, I'mma offer you a favor."
910,910,You can get on that raft with us and you can ride down there if you want.
911,911,"N... No, we're not going to hop on your little raft  and cruise around the river."
912,912," It's hot, you're confused."
913,913, I'm not asking you.
914,914," Zak Hey, Eleanor!"
915,915,Oh! Ooh! Oh.
916,916,Oh!
917,917,I want to see...
918,918,Salt Water Redneck.
919,919,And I don't want to go home.
920,920,"crickets chirping Eleanor clears throat So how far is it on, um..."
921,921,On the raft?
922,922,About that far on a map.
923,923, Are your fingers to scale?
924,924, Tyler Yeah.
925,925,So how much time is that much?
926,926,That's different than what I put up.
927,927, Eleanor All right.
928,928, What I did is about a day.
929,929,Maybe two days.
930,930, Days? Like...
931,931, Tyler Yeah.
932,932,chuckles Okay.
933,933, Are you kidding?
934,934, spits What in the Christ...
935,935,"Hey, Zak, why don't you sit down, bud."
936,936,You're kind of close to the edge.
937,937,I don't want you to fall in.
938,938,"Hey, are you hungry?"
939,939,Have you eaten anything?
940,940,I am not really hungry.
941,941,"Eleanor Well, maybe you should just have a bite of something for your blood sugar."
942,942,Tyler He don't want nothing to eat.
943,943,"You know how you get, buddy."
944,944,I have an apple.
945,945, Hey.
946,946, I have some M&M's.
947,947, Eleanor What?
948,948, Don't do that.
949,949,Eleanor Don't do what?
950,950,"Hey, I got an idea, why don't we keep our training going."
951,951,"Just because we're on a raft don't mean we gonna stop training, does it?"
952,952,"All right, so we're going to do breathing control exercises."
953,953,She's worried about your blood sugar.
954,954,We're going to breathe.
955,955,Take a deep breath in.
956,956,inhales  Out.
957,957," exhales All right, cool, now, come over here and put your head underwater."
958,958,I'm gonna time you.
959,959,"What? No, no, no."
960,960,He can't do that. Zak...
961,961,"No, he can do that."
962,962,He can do that. He can...
963,963,Tyler continues muffled There you go.
964,964,You'd better stop calling him a retard.
965,965,I have never called anyone a...
966,966,That word.
967,967,"Okay. Hold on, listen, when people are saying he's a retard, really what they're saying is he can't do some shit they can do."
968,968,"See, you might not be saying the word ""retard"", all right, I'll give you that, but you damn sure is making him feel retarded."
969,969,That ain't going to help his life.
970,970," Hey, there we go."
971,971, Time.
972,972, How long is that?
973,973, Long.
974,974,"Not long enough, Zak."
975,975,Do it again.
976,976,Okay.
977,977,You have got some real nerve talking to me like that.
978,978,Do you even know what I do?
979,979,I've spent the last two years of my life volunteering to hold people's hands as they pass away.
980,980,"I talk to them, I feed them, I wipe their asses, I change their clothes, I put them to bed."
981,981,And I'm the last person they see.
982,982,Don't act like you know jack shit about me.
983,983, All right.
984,984," Eleanor Yeah, maybe he should not be in a retirement home, but I didn't choose that for him."
985,985,"But that's what happened, and now I am doing  the best I can."
986,986, water splashes  Oh! Oh!

1175,1175,Clint How you doing?
1176,1176,Zak Hey.
1177,1177,You don't teach no wrestling school here no more?
1178,1178,I closed that about ten years ago.
1179,1179,Did you?
1180,1180,So I promised him he would...
1181,1181,He would do this one thing.
1182,1182,"You know, this wrestling thing."
1183,1183,And he told me about this school here in Ayden.
1184,1184,And we had... We had a big journey to get here.
1185,1185,"And, uh..."
1186,1186,"now I got to break his heart, you know?"
1187,1187,And I don't really know what to say to him.
1188,1188,"But that ain't your shit, you know?"
1189,1189,I don't mean to bring shit to your doorstep or nothing like that.

1202,1202," Tyler Hey, come up here."
1203,1203,You mind if he comes and says hi?
1204,1204,That'd be all right.
1205,1205,"Tyler Hey, pal, Salt Water don't live here no more."
1206,1206,But Clint's just a regular guy like me or you.
1207,1207,He wanted to shake your hand.
1208,1208,Hey.
1209,1209, How are you doing?
1210,1210, Clint Good.
1211,1211,Nice to meet you.

1218,1218,I bet we could find him by...
1219,1219,By the raft.
1220,1220,Maybe he is hiding by the swamp.
1221,1221,"He's not real, bud."
1222,1222,Salt Water don't exist.

1265,1265,"rock music playing Clint The first thing you do is, you're gonna kind of just, like, you're gonna feel out, you know, how big the ring is."
1266,1266,"You just go, you know, kind of check out, you know, what your space is, where you're gonna be moving around."
1267,1267,"All right, now, one of the fundamentals is when you go to hit a guy with an elbow."
1268,1268,"You got to hit a guy with an elbow,  but also do a foot stomp."
1269,1269, grunts Yeah.

1276,1276," chuckles Yeah, the Atomic Throw."
1277,1277,"Honestly, Zak, we just made that up."
1278,1278,"You know, it was smoke and mirrors."
1279,1279,It was just a camera on my face.
1280,1280,"And then it looked like I was holding the guy up over my head, and then we'd cut to a guy getting thrown out of the ring."
1281,1281,It's not possible to do.
1282,1282,But I can show you a lot of other cool stuff.
1283,1283,"What do you think, Sam?"
1284,1284,Might try a collar and elbow lockup.
