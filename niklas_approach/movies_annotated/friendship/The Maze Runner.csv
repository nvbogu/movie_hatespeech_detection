19,19,"PILOT: Zerooneniner, be advised."
20,20,You've taken on boarders at the rear.
21,21,We're engaging the truck now.
22,22,"Hey, Brenda, you got company!"
23,23,"Go, go, go!"
24,24,Open fire.
25,25,JORGE: Watch out!

50,50,Hello!
51,51,Squirrelly bastard.

93,93,"Yeah, we're fine."
94,94,Jesus.

96,96,It's okay. You guys are safe.
97,97,All right? Just hang on.
98,98,HARRIET: I need the bolt cutters.
99,99,Are you okay?
100,100,GIRL: I'm fine. How are you?
101,101,He's not here.
102,102,BOY: I'll take one.
103,103,WOMAN: Come on down.
104,104,You're safe here.
105,105,"MAN: Need medical attention, move to your left."
106,106,BOY: I need first aid.
107,107,"WOMAN: Right this way, guys."
108,108,Come on down here.
109,109,"VINCE: Come on in, guys!"
110,110,"MAN: Okay, guys, over here!"
111,111,"VINCE: All right, listen up."
112,112,I know you've all been through hell.
113,113,I wish I could say our troubles are over.
114,114,But we're not through this yet.
115,115,WICKED's still out there.
116,116,They're not giving up.
117,117,'Cause you got something they want.
118,118,They took you because you're immune to a plague that's wiping out the human race.
119,119,And they think you're worth sacrificing to find a cure.
120,120,"Well, I don't."
121,121,"So in two days, when we get this tub of rust seaworthy, we're getting the hell outta here."
122,122,We're gonna go to a place where WICKED will never find you.
123,123,A place you can start over.
124,124,A place you can call home.
125,125, VINCE: Are you with me?
126,126, (CROWD CHEERING)t JORGE: (GRUNTS) Come on.
127,127,VINCE: (IN DISTANCE) Come on up here. Let's get to work.
128,128,"Come on, I need some volunteers."
129,129,Let's go.
130,130,Let's get to work.
131,131,Let's get these crates on the boat.
132,132,We got two days before we leave.
133,133,All right.
134,134,Give me a hand up here.
135,135,May I help you?
136,136,It looks good.
137,137,How you feeling?
138,138,Awesome.
139,139,I was just asking.
140,140,"I know, I know, you're just asking."
141,141,Everybody's just asking.
142,142,Don't worry.
143,143,"When I Crank out, you'll be the first to know, okay?"
144,144,"HARRIET: Here, drink this."
145,145,Took you guys long enough to rescue us.
146,146,"It's good to see you, too, bud."
147,147,So what happened?
148,148,I fought back.
149,149,"Tried to, anyway."
150,150,You're lucky you found us at all.
151,151,They had us on the move a lot.
152,152,It felt like something big was happening.
153,153,Any idea where they were heading?
154,154,All I know is they kept talking about a city.
155,155,I didn't think there were any cities left.
156,156,BRENDA: That's because there aren't.
157,157,"Not still standing, anyway."
158,158,"Okay, wait. What about Minho?"
159,159,Why wasn't he on the train?
160,160,"I'm sorry, Thomas."
161,161,He was.
162,162,"They got 40, maybe 50 kids."
163,163,"We're still compiling an official count, but the pilot got a good look."
164,164,He thinks it was them.
165,165,Of course it was them.
166,166,What about the Berg?
167,167,We tracked it a few miles.
168,168,But someone must have known about the locator.
169,169,They're totally off the grid.
170,170,"GUARD: Move it, Immunes."
171,171,GUARD: C22.
172,172,B9.
173,173,"We're searching the area, but they're probably long gone by now."
174,174,"Oh, no, they're not going anywhere."
175,175,He didn't get what he really wanted.
176,176,"THOMAS: There, that's it."
177,177,It's a few hundred miles.
178,178,"Based on the railways, everything that Aris told us, that's gotta be where they're headed."
179,179,That's where they're taking Minho.
180,180,We take everyone who can fight.
181,181,Follow the roads where we can.
182,182,We can make it back within a week.
183,183,A week?
184,184,It took us six months to get here.
185,185,We got over We can't just hang out here forever after what we just pulled.
186,186,You wanna wander off to some random point on the map.
187,187,You don't even know what's there.
188,188,JORGE: I do.
189,189,"It's been a few years, but I've been there."
190,190,The Last City.
191,191,That's what WICKED called it.
192,192,It was their whole base of operations.
193,193,"If that city is still standing, that's the last place you wanna go, hermano."
194,194,That's the lion's den.
195,195,It's nothing we haven't done before.
196,196,"VINCE: Yeah, with months of planning, and reliable information, the element of surprise, none of which we have now."
197,197,"Vince, I've thought this through."
198,198,Would you just hear me out?
199,199,The last time we went off halfcocked...
200,200,I lost everything.
201,201,You remember that?
202,202,"Look, I know it's Minho. All right?"
203,203,But you can't ask me to put those kids on the line for one man.
204,204,I won't do it.
205,205,GUARD: (ON RADIO) Searching the grid now.
206,206,A is completed.
207,207,Scanning Bsector now.
208,208,Shit. Hit the lights.
209,209,"Let's go, let's go!"
210,210,"VINCE: Jeez, they're getting close."
211,211,You're right.
212,212,We can't stay here.
213,213,NEWT: Where do you think you're going then?
214,214,(SIGHS) Newt...
215,215,Don't be a twat about it.
216,216,I'm already in.
217,217,Come on.
218,218,"No. No, not this time."
219,219,"Look, even if we find Minho, there's no guarantee we make it back from this."
220,220,"Well, you'll need all the help you can get then, won't you?"
221,221,"Well, we started this together."
222,222,"May as well end it that way, too."
223,223,Okay.
224,224,Let's go get him back.
225,225,No.
226,226,(METALLIC CLANGING IN DISTANCE) Hey!
227,227,Hey!
228,228,"Hey! No, no, no."
229,229,Wait. Hey!
230,230,"Hey, wait, wait!"
231,231,"Hey, it's okay! Hey!"
232,232,WOMAN: (MUFFLED) How's he doing?
233,233,DOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Breathing levels look strong.
234,234,"Oh, shit!"
235,235,No! No!
236,236,"It's not as effective as the maze, but it seems to be working."
237,237,AVA: It's promising.
238,238,But we'll need a larger sample to work with.
239,239,DOCTOR: All right.
240,240,Carry on.
241,241,MINHO: No! No!
242,242,You want us to go in there?
243,243,"I don't wanna come across as too negative, but if I was a Crank, that's exactly where I would be."
244,244,I don't think we have much of a choice.
245,245,All right. I get shotgun.
246,246,"FRYPAN: Well, here we go."
247,247,"Yeah, just take it nice and slow."
248,248,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
249,249,"It's okay. It's just one, so take it slow, go around him."
250,250,We'll be fine.
251,251,Take it slow.
252,252,Take it slow.
253,253, (GASPS)  WOMAN: Please.
254,254,Please.
255,255,Help me.
256,256, Please.
257,257, (WINDOW THUDS)  Please! Let me in.
258,258," (JABBERING)  Okay. Fry, we gotta go."
259,259, Please! Open the door.
260,260, You need to go right now!
261,261, Why won't you open it?
262,262," Just floor it, Fry!"
263,263, (CRANKS SCREECHING)  Hold on!
264,264, Floor it! Come on!
265,265,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
266,266," Come on, Fry, shake him!"
267,267, I'm trying!
268,268,Go.
269,269,Hang on!
270,270,"Oh, God."
271,271,"Frypan, watch out!"
272,272,THOMAS: Everyone okay?
273,273,FRYPAN: My hand.
274,274,My hand.
275,275,"THOMAS: Fry, cover your eyes."
276,276,"Oh, shit. You okay, man?"
277,277, NEWT: Yeah. You all right?
278,278," FRYPAN: Shit, my hand."
279,279,Wait! Thomas!
280,280,"Thomas, the door!"
281,281,Can you get out?
282,282,"Oh, shit. All right."
283,283," FRYPAN: Newt, you all right?"
284,284," Fry, go around."
285,285,FRYPAN: I'm trying to get out.
286,286,"Newt, you okay?"
287,287,"Yeah, I think so."
288,288," Fry, you good?"
289,289," (CRANK SCREAMING) Oh, shit."
290,290,"Frypan, I think we gotta move."
291,291, Now!
292,292, FRYPAN: Wait a minute!
293,293, Right now!
294,294," Fry, now!"
295,295,"Come on, what are you doing?"
296,296,We gotta move! Come on!
297,297, Come on!
298,298, Hold on!
299,299, Frypan gotta go! Come on!
300,300, Wait!
301,301,Come on!
302,302," Nice shot, Fry."
303,303, Thanks.
304,304,THOMAS: Okay. We gotta go.
305,305,"Go, go!"
306,306,"Fry, come on, let's go!"
307,307," Fry, let's move, let's go!"
308,308, NEWT: Go! Go! Go!
309,309,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
310,310,Watch out.
311,311," Fry, you got any left?"
312,312, Yeah!
313,313,"Okay. This way, this way!"
314,314,"Okay, Fry."
315,315,"Other way, other way!"
316,316,I'm out!
317,317,Shit!
318,318,"Hey, get in!"
319,319," Go, Jorge, go!"
320,320, Go!
321,321,JORGE: Hang on!
322,322,I'm impressed!
323,323,You guys almost lasted a whole day.
324,324, You good?
325,325, Yeah.
326,326,I'm sorry. I didn't wanna bring you guys into this.
327,327,I think what he's trying to say is thanks for saving us.
328,328,You're welcome.
329,329,"JORGE: Hey, don't get your hopes up."
330,330,"That checkpoint back there, that was the city's last defense."
331,331,"If that was overrun, chances are the city is, too."
332,332,"Yeah, unless they figured out some other way to keep the Cranks out."
333,333,NEWT: Funny...
334,334,"Spent three years trapped behind walls, trying to break out, and now we wanna break back in."
335,335,Yeah. It's hilarious.
336,336,"Jorge, how do we get in?"
337,337,"Don't look at me, hermano."
338,338,Those walls are new.
339,339,I guess that's WICKED's answer for everything.
340,340,"Well, we ain't gonna figure it out from up here."
341,341,Let's go!
342,342,NEWT: You really think he's in there?
343,343,I guess we'll find out.
344,344,"You know she's gonna be there, too."
345,345,AVA: We just have to make sure we have the resources.
346,346,And I'll keep in touch.
347,347,Excuse me.
348,348,Are you ready?
349,349,It'll be fine.
350,350,"MAN: People are beginning to lose faith, Doctor."
351,351,"When you sealed off the walls, you assured us that it would only be a temporary precaution."
352,352,Why have you now denied all entry?
353,353,Because things are changing.
354,354,And not for the better.
355,355,Infection rates were up 300%.
356,356,"Fortunately, we may be on the verge of a breakthrough."
357,357,This is Subject A7.
358,358,He spent over three years in the Maze Trials.
359,359,The antibodies produced in response have been the strongest we've ever seen.
360,360,We're extracting a new serum as we speak.
361,361,"And with your support, we'd like to begin human trials."
362,362,"Thank you, Doctor."
363,363,That is very impressive.
364,364,But we have been down this road before.
365,365,"Frankly, we are all beginning to wonder if..."
366,366,If our resources couldn't be better spent elsewhere.
367,367, Meaning?
368,368, WOMAN: Safe zones.
369,369,Protected areas like the one we're in.
370,370,We could save as many people as possible.
371,371,How many?
372,372,A thousand?
373,373,Two thousand?
374,374,"And that's assuming your protected areas stay protected, which we know they won't."
375,375,The infected already outnumber the healthy threetoone.
376,376,All you'd be doing is delaying the inevitable.
377,377,Have any of you ever lost someone to the virus?
378,378,A niece.
379,379,Anna.
380,380,I'm sorry we weren't able to help her.
381,381,But imagine if we were able to live with the virus.
382,382,To survive it.
383,383,Imagine being able to tell Anna that you could give her the chance to live a normal life.
384,384,We've never been this close to a cure.
385,385,And we've sacrificed a lot to get this far.
386,386,"Please, don't let those sacrifices be for nothing."
387,387,Nicely done.
388,388,They can be a tough crowd.
389,389,You handled them perfectly.
390,390,"""Delaying the inevitable."" Thomas used to say the same about us."
391,391,Do you still think about him?
392,392,"I can help you with that, those memories."
393,393,There's no reason to keep holding on to them.
394,394,It's a simple procedure.
395,395,There is a reason.
396,396,I want to remember.
397,397,"If we find a cure, that's the only way all this was worth it."
398,398,I hope you're right.
399,399,This place has really gone through hell.
400,400,We just gotta stay together.
401,401,JASPER: (ON LOUDSPEAKER) We are the voice of the voiceless!
402,402,"They hide behind their walls, thinking they can keep the cure for themselves, while they watch the rest of us wither and rot!"
403,403,But there are more of us  than there are of them.
404,404," (CROWD CHEERING) And I say, we rise up and take back what is ours!"
405,405,Let's bring back a victory!
406,406,Get Janson.
407,407,Let us in!
408,408,That's it. That's our way in.
409,409,Let us in!
410,410,To the wall!
411,411,CROWD: Let us in!
412,412,Let us in! Let us in!
413,413,Thomas!
414,414,This is not what you're looking for.
415,415,"All these people trying to find their way in, you think you're gonna find something they can't?"
416,416,Came this far.
417,417,I'm not turning back now.
418,418,What the hell did we get ourselves into?
419,419,JORGE: Get out of my way!
420,420,Get out of my way!
421,421,"Thomas, this doesn't feel right."
422,422,"You were right, sir."
423,423,The drone sweep picked him up outside the walls.
424,424,Get the guns online.
425,425,"Hey, guys, we gotta go now."
426,426,Look.
427,427,"Let's go, let's go!"
428,428," Thomas, let's go."
429,429, We gotta get out of here!
430,430,Let's go! Let's go!
431,431,Go! Go! Go! Come on!
432,432,Go! Keep going!
433,433,Come on!
434,434,FRYPAN: Move!
435,435,Come on! Get in! Get in!
436,436,JORGE: Let's go!
437,437,Let's go! Let's go!
438,438,Come on!
439,439, NEWT: No way out!
440,440, FRYPAN: Come on!
441,441,Newt! Newt!
442,442,NEWT: Get your hands off of me!
443,443,No! Brenda!
444,444,Brenda! Brenda!
445,445,"GUARD: Go, go, go!"
446,446,THOMAS: Get off me!
447,447,Get off me!
448,448,Send out a patrol.
449,449,Tell them not to come back until he's found.
450,450,GUARD: Let's go!
451,451,Get out!
452,452,JORGE: Where you going?
453,453,"Where is she, you son of a bitch?"
454,454,BRENDA: Hey! Hey! Hey!
455,455,Shit! Hey! Wait!
456,456,"GUARD 1: Come on, come on, come on."
457,457,BRENDA: I'm right here.
458,458,I'm right here!
459,459," GUARD 2: Okay, okay, okay."
460,460, All right. Okay.
461,461,I'm right here.
462,462,I'm right here!
463,463,"Oh, Brenda."
464,464,GUARD 1: Everybody relax.
465,465,We're all on the same side here.
466,466,What do you mean same side?
467,467,Who the hell are you?
468,468,"Hey, Greenie."
469,469,Gally?
470,470,No way.
471,471,"NEWT: No, wait!"
472,472,Hold!
473,473,Stop! It's all right!
474,474,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
475,475,Stop! Stop it!
476,476,Stop.
477,477, He killed Chuck.
478,478," Yeah, I know."
479,479,I remember.
480,480,"I was there too, all right?"
481,481,But I also remember that he was stung and half out of his mind.
482,482,Just calm down. All right?
483,483,Come on.
484,484,Kind of had that coming.
485,485,Anybody else? Fry? Newt?
486,486,Do you know this guy?
487,487,He was an old friend.
488,488,NEWT: How?
489,489,How is this possible?
490,490,We watched you die.
491,491,"No, you left me to die."
492,492,"And if we hadn't found you when we did, you'd be dead right now."
493,493,What the hell are you doing here?
494,494,Minho.
495,495,WICKED has him here.
496,496,We're looking for a way in.
497,497,I can help with that.
498,498,Follow me.
499,499,I'm not going anywhere with you.
500,500,Suit yourself.
501,501,But I can get you through those walls.
502,502,"After the maze, I got picked up by a group headed to the city."
503,503,"They realized I was immune, patched me up, and they brought me here to Lawrence."
504,504,This group's been at war with WICKED ever since they took control of the city.
505,505,But WICKED can't hide behind those walls forever.
506,506,"Day's gonna come, and they're gonna pay for what they've done."
507,507,"Listen, uh, he doesn't get a lot of visitors."
508,508,"So, let me do the talking."
509,509,All right?
510,510,And try not to stare.
511,511,"LAWRENCE: Rose took my nose, I suppose."
512,512,"Rose took my nose, I suppose."
513,513,"Suppose, suppose, took my nose..."
514,514,I suppose.
515,515,"Gally, glad to see you made it back."
516,516,Jasper told me what happened.
517,517,GALLY: It was a slaughter.
518,518,There's nothing we could do against those guns.
519,519,"No, but they can only poke the hornet's nest so long before they get stung."
520,520," (SNIFFS)  (MUSIC STOPS) Now, who are these people?"
521,521,Why are they here?
522,522,We need to get into WICKED.
523,523,Gally said you can get us through the walls.
524,524,Gally should know better than to make promises that he can't keep.
525,525,"Besides, that wall is only half your problem."
526,526,Getting inside WICKED is impossible.
527,527,There might be a way now.
528,528,But it doesn't work without Thomas.
529,529,LAWRENCE: Is that so?
530,530,Do you know what I am...
531,531,Thomas?
532,532,I am a businessman.
533,533,Which means that I don't take unnecessary risks.
534,534,Why should I trust you?
535,535,'Cause I can help you.
536,536,"You see, if you can get me through those walls..."
537,537,I can get you what you need.
538,538,What is it that you think I need?
539,539,Time.
540,540,Every last drop.
541,541,LAWRENCE: Is that what I need?
542,542,WICKED has something we both want.
543,543,I'll tell you what.
544,544,Two can go for now.
545,545,The rest stay down here with me.
546,546,Just a little insurance to make sure you find your way back.
547,547,We have a deal?
548,548,"Gally, show him the way."
549,549,"Be careful, Thomas."
550,550,"Gally, take care of these two."
551,551,Yeah.
552,552,NEWT: This is gross.
553,553,Jesus.
554,554,"Yeah, this is great."
555,555,GALLY: Stay with me.
556,556,We got a ways to go.
557,557,We're ready.
558,558,TERESA: Shai?
559,559,"Hi, Miss Teresa."
560,560,Hi.
561,561,Hey.
562,562,How are you feeling?
563,563,SHAI: Okay.
564,564,Is that gonna make me better?
565,565,I hope so.
566,566,Do you remember the story you were telling me?
567,567,About the house you grew up in?
568,568,I don't remember.
569,569,TERESA: The one by the lake?
570,570,It burns.
571,571,"I know, I know."
572,572,There we go. All done.
573,573,You're so brave.
574,574,"JANSON: Oh, that is incredible."
575,575,How soon can you administer to the infected?
576,576,You show a lot of compassion for someone who just opened fire on a crowd.
577,577,You told me to do my job.
578,578,I had a shot. I took it.
579,579,"And missed, apparently."
580,580,The patrols never found a body.
581,581,Thomas is still out there.
582,582,What about her?
583,583,Does she know?
584,584,No.
585,585,She can't.
586,586,I need her to stay focused.
587,587,Elevate security levels throughout the city.
588,588,"I'm counting on you to handle this, Janson."
589,589,"ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Red zone, departing the station in five minutes."
590,590,Thank you.
591,591,This is a long way from the Glade.
592,592,ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Fifteen minutes to mandatory curfew.
593,593,Please proceed home in an orderly fashion.
594,594,"Remember, this is for your safety."
595,595,Thank you for your compliance.
596,596,"Yeah, we better get off these streets."
597,597,"And I know it's hard, but act like you've seen it before."
598,598,They've definitely upped security.
599,599,I'm guessing you shanks have something to do with that.
600,600,"All right, let's get outta here."
601,601,"All right, Newt, you're up."
602,602,I got it.
603,603,GALLY: There it is.
604,604,"If WICKED's got Minho, that's where they'll be keeping him."
605,605,Lawrence has been trying to find a way in for years.
606,606,Place is crawling with soldiers.
607,607,They got surveillance everywhere.
608,608,Scanners on every floor.
609,609,Sounds like a bloody fortress.
610,610,"Yeah, I thought you said you had a way in."
611,611,I might.
612,612,You might?
613,613,"What the hell do you mean ""might""?"
614,614,Take a look.
615,615,I said I had a way in.
616,616,I didn't say you were gonna like it.
617,617,No. There's gotta be another way.
618,618,Like what?
619,619,You've seen the building.
620,620,She is our only way in.
621,621,THOMAS: You really think she's gonna help us?
622,622,GALLY: I don't plan on asking for her permission.
623,623,Am I missing something here?
624,624,"This is the same girl who betrayed us, correct?"
625,625,Same dick?
626,626,I like her.
627,627,What's going on?
628,628,"What, are you afraid your little girlfriend's gonna get hurt?"
629,629,Hmm?
630,630,Because this has obviously never been just about rescuing Minho.
631,631,Has it?
632,632,"Wait, what are you talking about?"
633,633,Teresa.
634,634,She's the only reason that Minho's even missing in the first place.
635,635,Now we finally have an opportunity to get him back.
636,636,And what? You don't want to because of her?
637,637,"Because deep down inside you still care about her, don't you?"
638,638,Just admit it.
639,639," Newt, I..."
640,640, Don't lie to me!
641,641,Don't lie to me!
642,642,Sorry.
643,643,I'm sorry.
644,644,Sorry about that. Back there.
645,645,I guess I can't hide this anymore.
646,646,Why didn't you tell me?
647,647,Didn't think it would make any difference.
648,648,All I know is that WICKED must have put me in that maze for a reason.
649,649,Maybe it was literally just so they could tell the difference between immunes like you and people like me.
650,650,"You know we can still fix this, Newt."
651,651,Okay? We can.
652,652,Don't worry about me.
653,653,This is about Minho.
654,654,Now he needs us.
655,655,"So if there is even the slightest chance that we can save him, we can get him out of there, then we have to take that."
656,656,No matter what the cost.
657,657,Okay. I hear you.
658,658,GUARD: Let's get him up.
659,659,Minho.
660,660,Can you hear me?
661,661,There's a little girl here.
662,662,Her name is Shai Lun.
663,663,She's been infected for three weeks now.
664,664,"But, Minho, you're going to save her."
665,665,And you can save so many others.
666,666,"Everything we're doing here, it's working."
667,667,Do you understand?
668,668,That's why this is so important.
669,669,I just wanted you to know.
670,670,(SOFTLY) Teresa.
671,671,Minho?
672,672,Minho?
673,673,You're a traitor!
674,674,We trusted you!
675,675, TERESA: Get off!
676,676," GUARD: Hey, let her go!"
677,677,Get off me! Get off me!
678,678,I'll kill you! You traitor!
679,679,You killed them all!
680,680," (SCREAMING)  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Teresa, they need you in the med lab."
681,681,It sounds serious.
682,682,"I'm sorry, Teresa."
683,683,It's not your fault.
684,684,You did everything you could.
685,685,ANNOUNCER: This is an alert.
686,686,Curfew is now in effect.
687,687,Anyone caught in violation of curfew will be subject to immediate deportation.
688,688,Thomas?
689,689,Thomas.
690,690,"Hey, Teresa."
691,691,You shouldn't be here.
692,692,If Janson finds out you're here...
693,693,I'm not staying.
694,694,"It's just, uh..."
695,695,I had to see you.
696,696,I have to ask you something.
697,697,Do you regret it?
698,698,What you did to us?
699,699,Sometimes.
700,700,But I did what I thought was right.
701,701,I'd do it again.
702,702,Good.
703,703,"JANSON: Taking the edge off, I see."
704,704,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
705,705,Yes.
706,706, It's a lovely city.
707,707, Hmm.
708,708,The walls.
709,709,It's amazing what people can accomplish when their survival's at stake.
710,710,"Squeeze them hard enough, there's nothing they can't do."
711,711,No line they won't cross.
712,712,You've had a bit of a setback.
713,713,It's nothing we're not used to.
714,714,Not this time.
715,715,The virus is airborne.
716,716,It's inside the walls.
717,717,That serum was our last chance.
718,718,Anyone not already infected will be inside of a month.
719,719,Okay.
720,720,We can handle this.
721,721,"We just need to evacuate essential personnel, set up at another safe zone farther north."
722,722,We've still got 28 immunes right inside this building.
723,723,We can find more.
724,724,You would.
725,725,You'd hunt every last one of them down till there was no one left.
726,726,"In spite of everything we've done to them, everything we've put them through."
727,727,At least we gave them the tools they'll need to survive.
728,728,Maybe they'll succeed where we've failed.
729,729,Are you really telling me that you're giving up?
730,730,After everything?
731,731,"It's not about giving up, Janson."
732,732,It's about knowing when you've lost.
733,733,Gally?
734,734,Here's how this is gonna go.
735,735,"We're gonna ask you some questions, and you're gonna tell us exactly what we need to know."
736,736,We'll start off simple.
737,737,Where's Minho?
738,738,You guys don't seriously think...
739,739,Don't look at him.
740,740,Why are you looking at him?
741,741,Look at me.
742,742,He's not gonna help you.
743,743,"Now, we know you have Minho in the building."
744,744,Where?
745,745,He's with the others in holding.
746,746,Sublevel three.
747,747,How many others?
748,748,I can make that work.
749,749,TERESA: No.
750,750,"No, you guys don't understand."
751,751,The whole level's restricted.
752,752,You can't get in without a thumbprint ID.
753,753,That's why you're gonna come with us.
754,754,"Well, I don't know."
755,755,We don't necessarily need her.
756,756,Right?
757,757,Not all of her.
758,758, We just need her finger.
759,759," Gally, back off."
760,760,"GALLY: What, are you squeamish?"
761,761,I guarantee you she's done a lot worse to Minho.
762,762,That's not the plan.
763,763,Back off.
764,764,It won't make a difference.
765,765,Do whatever you want to me.
766,766,You still won't get through the front door.
767,767,The sensors will pick you up the...
768,768,We know. We're tagged.
769,769,Property of WICKED.
770,770,"You're gonna help us with that, too."
771,771,Try to relax.
772,772,This is gonna sting.
773,773,Let's just get it over with.
774,774,She enjoyed that.
775,775,You're probably right.
776,776,Here. See if these fit.
777,777, Thanks.
778,778," FRYPAN: Thanks, Newt."
779,779,"BRENDA: Better get going, old man."
780,780,Long road ahead of you.
781,781,You sure I can't talk you out of this?
782,782,It's your last chance.
783,783,"You know, it's not like you to shy away from a fight."
784,784,And it's not like you to go looking for one.
785,785,I just can't help but think if I walk out that door...
786,786,I'm never gonna see you again.
787,787,Since when do we go sticking our necks out for strangers?
788,788,"I was a stranger once, too."
789,789, Just don't leave us hanging.
790,790, No.
791,791,Never.
792,792,She's looking good.
793,793,Healthy.
794,794,How've you been getting her serum?
795,795,What are you talking about?
796,796,Brenda.
797,797,I didn't think she'd still be alive.
798,798,When was her last treatment?
799,799,THOMAS: At the Right Arm.
800,800,The last time we saw you.
801,801,But that was months ago.
802,802,"Thomas, that's not possible."
803,803,She should have turned by now.
804,804,There's no way she could possibly still...
805,805,"All right, that's enough."
806,806,You don't believe me?
807,807,Do you really expect me to?
808,808,You made your choice.
809,809,Everything okay over here?
810,810,Yeah.
811,811,"Yeah, we're done."
812,812,Nice try.
813,813,"You were in love with her, weren't you?"
814,814,I don't know.
815,815,Just be careful.
816,816,You sort of have this problem where you can't walk away from people.
817,817,Even when you should.
818,818,"You can't save everyone, Thomas."
819,819,I can try.
820,820,THOMAS: Don't stop.
821,821,"Go, go, go."
822,822,GALLY: Hold on. Hold on.
823,823,I can get in here.
824,824,THOMAS: Stay there.
825,825,Throw me the walkie.
826,826,"Frypan, we're in."
827,827,How you doing?
828,828,"Yeah, I'm getting there."
829,829,"Tell Minho ""Hi,"" for me."
830,830,"THOMAS: Hang in there, buddy."
831,831,GALLY: This'll work.
832,832,"Brenda, what's your status?"
833,833,"Status is, I'm working on it."
834,834,THOMAS: Copy. Just make sure you're ready on your end.
835,835,Don't worry.
836,836,You know I'm gonna be there.
837,837,"All right, let's go."
838,838,We got a signal.
839,839,Gally did it.
840,840,We're in.
841,841,Good.
842,842,Give me everything.
843,843,I want full control.
844,844,MAN: That's funny.
845,845,System's glitching.
846,846,I'll go check it out.
847,847,"MALE IMMUNE: Get back, get back! Move!"
848,848,"Come on, let's go."
849,849, Get them open.
850,850, Let's go.
851,851,It's okay.
852,852,You guys are okay. Come on.
853,853,"Come on, let's go."
854,854,"Newt, check the other cell."
855,855,"Come on, you guys are okay."
856,856,Come on.
857,857,The vault. How do I get in?
858,858,You can't.
859,859,"Come on, guys. Come on."
860,860,"GALLY: Guys, this might take some time."
861,861,Shit.
862,862,He's not here.
863,863,Where is he?
864,864,This really couldn't wait till morning?
865,865,"You realize this could kill him, right?"
866,866,"Taking this much, all at once."
867,867,I have my orders.
868,868,Janson wants it all.
869,869,Somebody's moved him up to the medical wing.
870,870,"Thomas, that's on the other side of the building."
871,871,"Okay, take me to him."
872,872,Right now.
873,873,All right.
874,874,I'm coming with you.
875,875,"Newt, no, you're not."
876,876,"You have to stay here, wait with Gally for the serum."
877,877,You can't do this on your own.
878,878,"Minho comes first, remember?"
879,879,Just go. We're wasting time.
880,880,I'll get the serum.
881,881,We'll meet you out back.
882,882,"Okay, fine."
883,883,Let's go. Come on.
884,884,"GALLY: Hey, Greenie."
885,885,Good luck.
886,886,THOMAS: Keep moving.
887,887,"THOMAS: Come on, come on."
888,888,Hold it.
889,889,You're working late.
890,890,"See, that's what I like about you, Teresa."
891,891,"No matter how bleak things get, you just..."
892,892,"Well, you never give up."
893,893,"Times like this, you need a friend that you can count on."
894,894,I'll bear that in mind.
895,895,There is one thing you should know.
896,896,One friend to another.
897,897,Thomas is here.
898,898,A surveillance picked him up outside the walls.
899,899,"Ava didn't want you to know, but there is a chance that he may try to contact you, and if he does, I'd like to think that I'd be your first call."
900,900,Are you going to kill him?
901,901,Would that be a problem?
902,902,This is me.
903,903,"Thomas, you have to listen to me."
904,904,Getting that serum won't save Newt.
905,905,"It might buy him some time, but..."
906,906,NEWT: Just ignore her.
907,907,She's trying to get inside your head.
908,908,"Thomas, listen. You know what's going on out there."
909,909,People are dying.
910,910,The world is dying.
911,911,There's something about your blood I don't understand.
912,912,THOMAS: Open it.
913,913,If you let me run some tests...
914,914,I promise I can protect you.
915,915,Yeah?
916,916,Like you protected Minho?
917,917,What are you doing?
918,918,How many people is it gonna take?
919,919,"How many more people do they have to round up, torture, kill?"
920,920,Huh? When the hell does it stop?
921,921,It stops when we find a cure.
922,922,There is no goddamn cure!
923,923,"Don't waste your breath, Teresa."
924,924,He made his choice long ago.
925,925,"GUARD: Drop it, kid!"
926,926,Back up.
927,927,Tell them to back off.
928,928,Tell them to back off!
929,929,"Hey, Thomas, come on."
930,930,It's me.
931,931,I've known you longer than you can remember.
932,932,You're not gonna shoot her.
933,933,You don't think so?
934,934,Okay.
935,935,Go on then.
936,936,Shoot her.
937,937,Prove me wrong.
938,938,Shoot her.
939,939,Clear! Clear!
940,940,GUARD: Move! Move!
941,941,Your story better be good.
942,942,I just did you a favor.
943,943,Doors are sealed.
944,944,They can't get out.
945,945,"Janson, I need them alive."
946,946, Come on. Come on!
947,947," GUARD: All right, let's move!"
948,948,"GUARD 2: Yes, sir!"
949,949,"Level three, now!"

951,951,You stay close to me.
952,952,Stick together.
953,953,"You, you guard this with your life. You understand?"
954,954,All right.
955,955,Let's go.
956,956,Lock down the building.
957,957,Send everyone up to 20.
958,958,And someone shut off those goddamn sirens!
959,959,"GUARD: Yes, sir."

968,968,"Quickly, quickly."
969,969,"Front and back, front and back. Let's go."
970,970,"Wait, where's Thomas?"
971,971,I was hoping he was with you.
972,972,Come on.
973,973,Wait! Wait!
974,974,Stay here with the kids.
975,975,Wait here...
976,976,I'll find him.
977,977,"Just wait for us, okay?"
978,978,We're not going anywhere.
979,979,Anything?
980,980,"SOLDIER: No sign of them yet, sir."
981,981,"Yeah, well, they're here somewhere."
982,982,They can't get out. Find them.
983,983,"You two, that way."
984,984,"The rest of you, follow me. Let's go."
985,985," GUARD 1: Yes, sir!"

1095,1095,How far are the tunnels?
1096,1096,"Uh, maybe 12 blocks from here."
1097,1097,We can make it.
1098,1098,"Newt, how are you feeling?"
1099,1099,Terrible.
1100,1100,It's good to see you though.

1127,1127,"I may not be pretty, but we all know who the enemies are, cowering behind those walls!"
1128,1128,They have a name for people like us in there.
1129,1129,They call us Cranks!
1130,1130,But I say that they are the monsters.
1131,1131,"They're the ones who started this war, but tonight, we will finish it."

1228,1228,Minho.
1229,1229,"You gotta run ahead, grab the serum, and get back to us as soon as you can."
1230,1230,"Minho, go."
1231,1231,He's right. I can cover.

1274,1274,There's still time for him.
1275,1275,There's a reason Brenda isn't sick anymore.
1276,1276,It's your blood.
1277,1277,Do you understand?
1278,1278,"She isn't sick, because you cured her."
1279,1279,She doesn't have to be the only one.

1300,1300,Newt.
1301,1301,Tommy.
1302,1302,"No, no."
1303,1303,"No, no, no."
1304,1304,Newt?
1305,1305,Is it true?
1306,1306,Newt.
1307,1307,Could I have saved him?
1308,1308,You can save us all.
1309,1309,AVA: (SOFTLY) It's okay.
1310,1310,Just leave the others alone.
1311,1311,I promise.
1312,1312, I will...
1313,1313," (GUNSHOT) Oh, Thomas."
1314,1314,You should have run.
1315,1315,TERESA: Thomas.
1316,1316,Can you hear me?
1317,1317,"JANSON: Do you know what this place is, Thomas?"
1318,1318,It's a lifeboat.
1319,1319,"And the whole world might be sinking, but doesn't mean that we have to go down with it."
1320,1320,How much longer?
1321,1321,TERESA: It's almost done.
1322,1322,Why don't you just kill me?
1323,1323,Kill you?
1324,1324,"No, we don't wanna do that."
1325,1325,We're gonna take special care of you.
1326,1326,We'll keep you alive.
1327,1327, Just.
1328,1328," (GRUNTS) And in return, you will give life to the rest of us."
1329,1329,"The ones we choose to save, anyway."
1330,1330,"Of course, there's not gonna be enough for everyone."
1331,1331,Hard choices are gonna have to be made.
1332,1332,"In time, the Flare virus will burn itself out."
1333,1333,"The only question is, who will be the ones left standing?"
1334,1334,"And thanks to you, to this, we finally get to choose."
1335,1335,A future of our own making.
1336,1336,To your health.
1337,1337,"Okay, let's get out of here."
1338,1338,Come on.
1339,1339,THOMAS: No!
1340,1340,Get back here.
1341,1341,Get back!
1342,1342,No!
1343,1343,Give it to me.
1344,1344,Give it to me!
1345,1345,THOMAS: Teresa!
1346,1346,Come on.
1347,1347,Okay.
1348,1348,That's enough.
1349,1349,Weapons ready!
1350,1350,On my command.
1351,1351,Charge it!
1352,1352,Ready.
1353,1353,Fire!
1354,1354,Teresa!
1355,1355,We need to get out of here.
1356,1356,What's wrong?
1357,1357,Thomas?
1358,1358,Thomas!
1359,1359," Okay. Okay, we need to..."
1360,1360," Oh, shit..."
1361,1361,Find something.
1362,1362,Here. Here!
1363,1363,Just put pressure on it.
1364,1364,Hold it.
1365,1365,You gotta go.
1366,1366,You gotta go.
1367,1367,No.
1368,1368,Not without you.
1369,1369,"I admit, Teresa, you had me fooled."
1370,1370,I thought we were friends.
1371,1371,Maybe it's just in your nature to betray the people closest to you.
1372,1372,Come on.
1373,1373,Let's not prolong this.
1374,1374,We both know there's no way outta here.
1375,1375,Let's not make this any more painful than it needs to be.
1376,1376,Thomas.
1377,1377,Teresa.
1378,1378,No. No.
1379,1379,I think you have something of mine.
1380,1380,Not that.
1381,1381,Where is he?
1382,1382,Just take it.
1383,1383,Leave him alone.
1384,1384,What is it with you two?
1385,1385,You think he's so special?
1386,1386,He's a lab rat.
1387,1387,He was born with a gift.
1388,1388,"He never had to fight for it, he never earned it."
1389,1389,He doesn't deserve it.
1390,1390,Maybe.
1391,1391,But it's his.
1392,1392,"What about you, Thomas?"
1393,1393,What do you have to say?
1394,1394,Don't you have enough blood on your hands already?
1395,1395,You might not have been able to shoot her.
1396,1396,But I can.
1397,1397,Okay. Fine.
1398,1398,Have it your way.
1399,1399,THOMAS: Janson.
1400,1400,"Missed, you little shit."
1401,1401,Did I?
1402,1402,"Oh, shit."
1403,1403,Come on. We need to go.
1404,1404,This way. Here.
1405,1405,Come on.
1406,1406,Come on.
1407,1407,I'm sorry.
1408,1408,I tried.
1409,1409,I know.
1410,1410,I think I got him.
1411,1411,"Yeah, that's him."
1412,1412,I'll get the hatch.
1413,1413,"All right, I got him, I got him."
1414,1414,"Let's go, let's go."
1415,1415,Come on.
1416,1416,No!
1417,1417,I can't get any closer.
1418,1418,MINHO: Thomas!
1419,1419,TERESA: Now!
1420,1420,"Come on, come on, come on."
1421,1421, MINHO: Come on!
1422,1422," FRYPAN: Come on, Thomas!"
1423,1423,Give me your hand!
1424,1424,Get closer!
1425,1425,Jump!
1426,1426,Lower!
1427,1427,No!
1428,1428,You gotta get closer.
1429,1429,Come on!
1430,1430,VINCE: Yeah!
1431,1431," Come on, reach! Come on!"
1432,1432, Reach!
1433,1433, Pull him up!
1434,1434, Pull!
1435,1435,Come on!
1436,1436,VINCE: Come on!
1437,1437,Teresa!
1438,1438,No!
1439,1439,VINCE: We have come a long way together.
1440,1440,So many have sacrificed so much to make this place possible.
1441,1441,Your friends and your family.
1442,1442,So here's to the ones who couldn't be here.
1443,1443,Here's to the friends we lost.
1444,1444,This place is for you.
1445,1445,It's for all of us.
1446,1446,"But this, this is for them."
1447,1447,"So, in your own time, in your own way, come make your peace."
1448,1448,And welcome to the Safe Haven.
1449,1449, Yeah!
1450,1450, Yeah!
1451,1451,You all want some food?
1452,1452,This is gonna be a good home for us.
1453,1453,Yeah.
1454,1454,You had this on you while you were passed out.
1455,1455,Figured I'd keep it safe for ya.
1456,1456,"Thanks, Minho."
1457,1457,See you out there.
1458,1458,See ya.
1459,1459,NEWT: Dear Thomas...
1460,1460,This is the first letter I can remember writing.
1461,1461,"Obviously, I don't know if I wrote any before the maze."
1462,1462,"But even if it's not my first, it's likely to be my last."
1463,1463,I want you to know that I'm not scared.
1464,1464,"Well, not of dying, anyway."
1465,1465,It's more forgetting.
1466,1466,It's losing myself to this virus.
1467,1467,That's what scares me.
1468,1468,So every night I've been saying their names out loud.
1469,1469,Alby...
1470,1470,"Winston, Chuck."
1471,1471,"And I just repeat them over and over, like a prayer, and it all comes flooding back."
1472,1472,"Just the little things, like the way the sun used to hit the Glade at that perfect moment right before it slipped beneath the walls."
1473,1473,And I remember the taste of Frypan's stew.
1474,1474,I never thought I'd miss that stuff so much.
1475,1475,And I remember you.
1476,1476,I remember the first time you came up in the Box.
1477,1477,Just a scared little Greenie who couldn't even remember his own name.
1478,1478,"But from that moment you ran into the maze, I knew I would follow you anywhere."
1479,1479,And I have.
1480,1480,We all have.
1481,1481,"If I could do it all over again, I would and I wouldn't change a thing."
1482,1482,"And my hope for you is that when you're looking back years from now, you'll be able to say the same."
1483,1483,"The future's in your hands now, Tommy."
1484,1484,And I know you'll find a way to do what's right.
1485,1485,You always have.
1486,1486,Take care of everyone for me.
1487,1487,And take care of yourself.
1488,1488,You deserve to be happy.
1489,1489,Thank you for being my friend.
1490,1490,"Goodbye, mate."
1491,1491,Newt.
