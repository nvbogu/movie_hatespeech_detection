So when you see a Negro today who's named Johnson, if you go back in his history you'll find that he was once his grandfather or one of his forefathers was owned by a White man who was named Johnson. If his name was Bunch, his grandfather was owned..."

408,408,He's in a much better place.
409,409,We should all be so lucky.
410,410,Where is he?
411,411,He'll be buried tonight.
412,412,Not him.
413,413,...Barry.
414,414,Any particular reason for your interest?
415,415,He's one of us and he's...
416,416,Disappeared.
417,417,So we should know what's happened to him.
418,418,You want to know?
419,419,Yes...
420,420,Oh you guys really want to know?
421,421,Yes!
422,422,"Well, if you must know, Barrington is being held in solitary confinement. He's in deep penance, repenting for his sins."
423,423,The majority of which you helped him commit.
424,424,He didn't mean to kill him...
425,425,And you know that because?
426,426,You're all of a sudden God?
427,427,I'm not. I just think that...
428,428,Shut up!
429,429,...You're not the gatekeeper of good and bad.
430,430,"No, I'm not the gate keeper."
431,431,I'm the fucking wolf that strikes the Shepherd and this is no longer fucking Bethlehem.
432,432,"So, you're calling us sheep?"
433,433,"Clapping Yes, finally!"
434,434,Someone who's thinking with their brain.
435,435,That's exactly what you are... sheep.
436,436,"Where I say you go, you go."
437,437,I'm nobody's sheep.
438,438,Oh yes you are.
439,439,You came here. All of you came here to be led...
440,440,"And me, no stranger to kindness and my brothers..."
441,441,We decided to keep you.
442,442,This feels good to you?
443,443,This...?
444,444,"Hospitality, kindness, compassion..."
445,445,There's no compassion behind any of this.
446,446,Taking in the morally corrupt and absolving them of their transgressions?
447,447,Transgressions...?
448,448,Oh c'mon I'm a beacon of compassion!
449,449,Wouldn't you say so young Theodore?
450,450,"You should be more like your brother, Theodore."
451,451,"Speaking of transgressions, Jamaal?"

462,462,"You did like her, didn't you?"
463,463,Yes. You do you have a thing for young girls.
464,464,"You enjoyed watching her, didn't you?"
465,465,Through her window in the morning when she was getting ready.
466,466,Following her to school...
467,467,"You enjoyed the smell of coconuts, don't you?"
468,468,She did like the particular perfume.
469,469,A coconut scented perfume...
470,470,What the fuck is this place?
471,471,...Language!
472,472,"Do you always ask this many questions, Mr. Daniels?"
473,473,Only at dinner.
474,474,A sharpshooter!
475,475,"I'm not easily impressed, especially by your kind."
476,476,You care for a proposition?
477,477,My kind?
478,478,You care for a proposition?
479,479,No!
480,480,"Here, I'll tell you anyway."
481,481,You ask one more question and I'll kill you.
482,482,Or you ask no more questions and you allow us to enjoy this nice meal and i'll think about maybe keeping alive until the next round.

629,629,"Now, let me tell you a story. Now, let me tell you what happens to disobedient boys."
630,630,I named him Donald. I loved Donald. He was my favorite toy.
631,631,"Now, I really enjoyed playing with him because when I came back from school, after all the kids used to bully me..."
632,632,I don't know why they fucking bullied me...
633,633,"I don't even really know. But when I came home, he used to make me feel good."
634,634,He used to make me feel happy.
635,635,"I don't even really know. But when I came home, he used to make me feel good."
636,636,"So one day, I'm on my way home from school, and I'm just thinking about Donald."
637,637,All I'm thinking about is Donald... Donald... Donald!
638,638,Donald is gonna make me feel better.
639,639,"I get home, and I see Patrick playing with him in the garden. Patrick was my brother."
640,640,"You see, my parents."
641,641,"They had this thing for the names 'P' There was me Pete, there was Patrick, there was Precious!"
642,642,Precious!
643,643,Precious... she was my precious little sister.
644,644,But this isn't about Precious! This is about Patrick!
645,645,"I come home, I go to the garden and I see Patrick playing with Donald. And I run over and I say: Patrick, please stop playing with him, otherwise I'm gonna have to kill you."
646,646,Of course I don't mean it. I don't fucking mean it. I don't want to kill him. He's my brother.
647,647,Why in the fuck would I want to kill my brother?
648,648,"And then I tell him: Stop playing with him. Does he listen?... No, he keeps throwing him up and down..."
649,649,...and up and down.
650,650,and up and down!
651,651,He lands in the dirt. He's muddy. He's fucking muddy now.
652,652,So I run in the kitchen. I get my mom's favorite knife.
653,653,She's got this six inch long blade. And I come back in the garden and do you know what I do?
654,654,I stab Patrick repeatedly...
655,655,Over and over again...
656,656,Over and over again!
657,657,Over and over and over again...
658,658,Do you not see what happens to disobedient little boys?
