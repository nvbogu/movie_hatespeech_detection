14,14,"And, uh, careful."
15,15,Careful. Thank you.
16,16,Observe.

18,18,"By the time you finish the first draft, which is to say, in 90 days, you should be a worldclass sprinter."
19,19,"Rita, come in here, will you?"
20,20,This is Mrs. Alexander.
21,21,She types 100 perfect words a minute and takes dictation like a clairvoyant.
22,22,"Rita Alexander, Herman Mankiewicz."
23,23,"How do you do, Mr. Mankiewicz?"
24,24,"Uh, that's a big question."
25,25,"Well, since you like working nights, Rita here runs on London time."
26,26,Her husband is one of our bold lads in the RAF.
27,27," Fliesâ¦ What is it, Rita? Spitfires?"
28,28, Hurricanes.
29,29, My sympathy and prayers.
30,30, I beg your pardon?
31,31,"Given the speed, climb, and turning radius of the Messerschmitt Bf 109..."
32,32,"I hope we won't need your sympathy, Mr. Mankiewicz."
33,33,We'll do the praying and the fighting.
34,34,I will meet with Orson weekly.
35,35,Keep him to date on our progress.
36,36,We're expecting great things.
37,37,What is it the writer says?

39,39,I don't know that writer.
40,40,Hello.
41,41,"Yes. Yes, he's right here."
42,42,"Well, you should have everything."

48,48,Oh.
49,49, Hello.
50,50, Mank!

52,52,Lucky me.
53,53, How's the leg?

58,58,Let's aim for 60.
59,59,He's just cut a month.
60,60,I used to do it in five for you at the Mercury. This is leisurely.
61,61," Sixty days, and then we can noodle."
62,62, Nothing like a good noodle.
63,63,"Uh, is the reason you lopped 30 days to run it past the RKO legal?"
64,64,"I thought I told you, Mank."
65,65,"I have final cut, final everything."
66,66,There are no studio notes.
67,67,We'll have no one but ourselves to blame.
68,68, Sixty days and a noodle.
69,69," Mr. Welles, we're ready."

75,75,"Break wind at Hollywood and Vine, and a producer in Santa Monica reports a ruptured main."
76,76,"No, I don't know this burgh, not yet."
77,77,"I'm toiling with you in spirit, Mank."
78,78,And I don't hear any typing.
79,79,No notes.
80,80,And then he turns 24.
81,81,Trapped.
82,82,Uhuh.
83,83,Let me take off these clothes.
84,84,They let me go just as I achieved perfect equilibrium.
85,85,"I won't work with half the producers on the lot, and the other half won't work with me."
86,86,"What's this, a racing form?"
87,87,"You stop reading, you stop learning."
88,88,Hold still.
89,89,Lay back.
90,90,"Cigarette, please."
91,91,"Hermie, if a match gets anywhere near your breath, you'll burst into flames."
92,92,Even the dog's name is awful.
93,93,Sounds like a Japanese houseboy.
94,94,"You mark my words, Sara."
95,95,The Wizard of Oz is gonna sink that studio.
96,96,Sleep. You're driving to New York tomorrow.
97,97,Remember when you used to take the train from back East?
98,98,I'd sneak aboard in Albuquerque and climb into your compartment naked.
99,99,"I also remember how I spent my honeymoon in Berlin, with hookers running up and down the stairs all night because my dashing correspondent couldn't afford a nice hotel."
100,100,Weren't those the days?
101,101,"Yeah, yeah, and the nights weren't bad either."
102,102, Schnutz.
103,103," For the last time, what?"
104,104, What year is it?
105,105, Hermanâ¦  I should have done something by now.
106,106," Oh, Hermieâ¦ Give me a sign, oh, Lord."
107,107,"I am as your servant Moses, though I won't work half as cheap."
108,108,"Go to sleep, meshuggener."
109,109, Schnutz?
110,110, What?
111,111,Why do you put up with me?
112,112,I don't know.
113,113,"That bush in the front yard, if it catches fire tonight, you will let me know?"
114,114,"I mean, you know all kinds of things."
115,115,"Iambic pentameter, the words of the great poets."
116,116,What about the way she signed it?
117,117,"""Always, Ethel."" Can you beat that?"
118,118,"Not just ""Ethel."" ""Always, Ethel."" Tommy, if we can find civilization by sundown, I hope to climb out of this crate and into a cold martini."
119,119,"She's not the kind to use ""always"" if she didn't mean it."
120,120,"If she meant just ""Ethel,"" she'd write just ""Ethel,"" not ""always.""  Wouldn't you think?"
121,121," Uh, the road, Tommy."
122,122,I know.
123,123,You read it and see what I mean.
124,124,"She loves me, don't you think?"
125,125,Mank? It's Orson Welles.
126,126, Of course it is.
127,127, I think it's time we talked.
128,128,I'm all ears.
129,129,"Once a castle on a hill, now a memory of what once was."
130,130,"Alone in his unfinished, already decaying pleasure palace, aloof, seldom visited, never photographed, we see an old man in a robe, smoking a pipe, sitting alone by his poolâ¦ â¦um, uh, discarded pages scattered at his feet."
131,131,"Narrator, ""An emperor of newsprint continued to direct his failing empire, vainly attempting to sway, as he once did, the destinies of a nation which had long since ceased to listen to himâ¦"" No. ""Had ceased to trust him."" We see through trees as an aide pushes this old man in a wheelchair across neatly groomed lawns."
132,132,"Narrator, ""There, last month, as it must to all men, death came to...""  Let's have that cuppa, Mrs. A."
133,133, Oh.
134,134,I know who it is.
135,135,Or who it's meant to be.
136,136,What makes you think it's meant to be anybody?
137,137,"Oh, come, now."
138,138,Everyone in the Englishspeaking world will recognize him instantly.
139,139,Exactly what he would say.
140,140, Did you know the man?
141,141, Maybe.
142,142,I used to.
143,143, You wrote for one of his papers?
144,144," Oh, no, praise God."
145,145,I met him after he started bankrolling his girlfriend's pictures.
146,146,You knew Marion Davies?
147,147, If anyone did.
148,148, Really?
149,149,What's she like?
150,150,"Why is it when you scratch a prim, starchy English schoolgirl, you get a swooning movingpicture fan who has forgotten all she ever learned about the Battle of Hastings?"
151,151,"Hastings. 14 October 1066, ten centigrade."
152,152,Mank?
153,153,Sorry.
154,154,Somebody told me Mankiewicz was in here.
155,155,"He is. I'm the promising brother, Joe."
156,156, I didn't know Herman had a brother.
157,157, Neither does anyone else.
158,158,Let me guess.
159,159,"""There are millions to be made, and your only competition is idiots,"" stop."
160,160,How did you know?
161,161,"I hate to tell you, anyone who can rub three words together and make a sentence gets one."
162,162,Come on.
163,163,"It's after lunch, and we're on a deadline."
164,164,He may be busy.
165,165, I promise I won't be a bother.
166,166, Not exactly what I meant.
167,167,Come on! Hey.
168,168,You know I'm good for it.
169,169, Fellas.
170,170, Shh. These are high stakes.
171,171,Go on.
172,172," Ooh, tails! That's it!"
173,173, God damn it!
174,174," Oh, Mank!"
175,175, All right. Double or nothing.
176,176,"This time, banjoeyed son of a bitch, let it hit the floor."
177,177," ""Banjoeyed.""  Son of a bitch?"
178,178,Mank once bet me a fivespot to see how long it would take a falling leaf to hit the ground.
179,179, Had to go to management to cover it.
180,180, For five bucks?
181,181,Five thousand.
182,182,"Come on, come on."
183,183,"Heads, you bastard!"
184,184,Oh!
185,185,"Oh, Mank!"
186,186,"Ooh! Pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen."
187,187,"Hey, Charlie."
188,188,"Yeah. You all remember the Algonquin cabin boy, Charlie Lederer, a poor but somewhat talented magazine writer, come West to join our merry band."
189,189," Well, you know most everyone."
190,190, Mr. Kaufman.
191,191,"George is fine, kid."
192,192, Mr. Perelman.
193,193," Nice to meet you, son."
194,194,Do you prefer Sidney or SJ?
195,195,"Uh, he takes what he gets."
196,196,The great Charles MacArthur.
197,197,Good to see you again.
198,198,"My resident jackofalltrades, Shelly Metcalf."
199,199," Hey, kid."
200,200, Mr. Metcalf.
201,201,"Oh, save the ""mister"" for the anointed."
202,202,"And last, not yet among them, my brother Joe."
203,203,"Have Cyclone say, ""I don't mind the heat as much as I do the humanity."" And the one and only Ben Hecht."
204,204,Have you been laid yet?
205,205,Do you have to think about that?
206,206,Hello.
207,207,Yeah. Right away.
208,208,"Selznick, everyone. Five minutes."
209,209,You've arrived in the wellknown nick.
210,210,Just in time for a story conference with the great David O.
211,211," Once more unto the breachâ¦  Breach? Hell, unto the wireâ¦ Without a net."
212,212,"Keep your mouth shut and watch us for your cue, okay?"
213,213,Cue?
214,214,What I wouldn't give to see that in a tight sweater.
215,215,"Herm, can I use that?"
216,216,"I need a status report. Boys, come on in."
217,217,"Ah, make yourselves at home."
218,218,"Now, you all know Joe von Sternberg."
219,219,"You wanted 72 hours, you got 72 hours."
220,220,Tell us what you have so far.
221,221," Ben, why don't you start?"
222,222," Well, this was tough, David."
223,223,"In the beginning, we couldn't agree on an approach."
224,224,Really? And why was that?
225,225,"Well, we see a different kind of Paramount picture."
226,226,Different how?
227,227,"Frankenstein and The Wolf Man all rolled into one, only..."
228,228,"I don't make cheap horror pictures, Universal does."
229,229,"Uh, this is different."
230,230,This is about something.
231,231,Okayâ¦ Sidney.
232,232,"Imagine a mad scientist, touring the boonies with a mechanical freak he's fabricated."
233,233,"Now, what does he mean, ""fabricated""?"
234,234,"And displays it to superstitious hayseeds in a giant, silklined casket for the price of admission."
235,235,"But every full moon, the monster awakens and raises unholy hell with the villagers."
236,236,"Give it a Eastern European look, men in leather shorts, gals in tattered peasant blouses."
237,237, Let me guess. They think it's the devil?
238,238, Villagers always think it's the devil.
239,239,And the scientist and his creation are forced to flee during a raging electrical storm.
240,240,Flee from outraged peasantsâ¦ Who pursue them mit torchesâ¦ Overturn their creaky wagonâ¦ And set fire to it.
241,241,"Tell him about the finale, Charlie."
242,242,Oh.
243,243,"Wellâ¦ the rain turns to sleet, puts out the fire, and entombs the monster in solid ice."
244,244,"While nearby, an old priest weeps."
245,245,Hmm. A weeping priest?
246,246,"Thunder, lightning, blood, fire, religionâ¦ All in one film?"
247,247,And with an unseasonal thawâ¦ a sequel.
248,248,"I thought you said this was about something, this was different."
249,249,"Plus, the ominous futility of man playing God."
250,250,The Faustian bargain of life everlasting.
251,251,And the triumph of the human spirit over the beast incarnate in our fartoosolid flesh.
252,252,It's directorproof.
253,253,Joe.
254,254, B picture.
255,255, It's not for Joe.
256,256,"Boys, this is serious. We need your help."
257,257,"We've got to get people into theaters, butâ¦ how?"
258,258,Show movies in the streets.
259,259,"You okay, Charlie?"
260,260,Taken care of this weekend?
261,261, I'm going to see my aunt.
262,262," Oh, that sounds like fun."
263,263,You obviously don't know my aunt.
264,264,"If you're not doing anything, come along."
265,265,"Careful, I just might."
266,266,Glendale station at 7:00.
267,267,Bring Sara if you like.
268,268, Who?
269,269," Sara, isn't that your wife?"
270,270,"Oh, you mean Poor Sara."
271,271,"No, she and the kids are back East."
272,272,Herman.
273,273,Herman.
274,274, Herman!
275,275, Charlie!
276,276,Ah.
277,277,"Cut! Next setup, please."
278,278,What is Mank doing here?
279,279, Who?
280,280, Herman Mankiewicz.
281,281, Do I know him?
282,282, He wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
283,283, Ah.
284,284, Mank!
285,285," Thalberg, the boy genius."
286,286, I am shocked to see you here.
287,287,"I'd be shocked to see me here, too, Irving, if only I knew where here was."
288,288, You wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
289,289, Among many.
290,290, Pictures?
291,291, Writers.
292,292," At MGM, movies are a team sport."
293,293, Which may be why I'm at Paramount.
294,294,Since when don't Paramount use writers by the truckload?
295,295,"But all at once, not in relays."
296,296,Helps spread the blame around.
297,297,"You remember our chairman, Louis B. Mayer?"
298,298,By reputation only.
299,299, Long night?
300,300, A short one. Plagued by spirits.
301,301,"A hell of a way to spend the Sabbath, fellas."
302,302,Here in support of a friend.
303,303,His leading lady is making a midcareer adjustment.
304,304,"Ah, I'm on my way over."
305,305,Any notes from the oversight tent?
306,306, Who was that again?
307,307, Just a writer.
308,308,"Slumming on a Saturday, Mr. Metcalf?"
309,309,Mank.
310,310,"No, sir, helping out on B camera."
311,311,"It's a home movie, but his idea of a home movie."
312,312,I know you.
313,313,"Well, what's at stake here?"
314,314,We met at John Gilbert's birthday.
315,315,You're Herman Mankiewicz.
316,316,Guilty.
317,317,"And I remember you, Miss Davies."
318,318,Regaling us with stories about dodging trolley cars in Brooklyn.
319,319,Your Flatbush was showing.
320,320,You fractured Wally Beery's wrist Indian wrestling.
321,321,"Admittedly, a lucky break."
322,322,"Boy, was he surprised."
323,323,You're stronger than you look.
324,324,"And from what I understand, you're smarter."
325,325,That was a compliment.
326,326, See what I mean?
327,327, You are interesting.
328,328,"I need a favor, but you're gonna have to promise you won't laugh."
329,329,"Given the state of the world, a tall order."
330,330,You're gonna. I just know you are.
331,331,"I have got such a hangover right now, there's just a fighting chance I won't."
332,332,"I'm being burned at the stake, and I am dying for a ciggieboo."
333,333,There. God's punishing you.
334,334,Watch those stairs. They're treacherous.
335,335,Every moment of my life is treacherous.
336,336,Any last words?
337,337,Welcome to San Simeon.
338,338,I've written worse.
339,339, You've never seen it?
340,340," No, but George Bernard Shaw was right."
341,341,How's that?
342,342,"""It's what God might've built had he had the money."" Well, as they say in the Bronx, ""Make yourself to home,"" Mr. Mankiewicz."
343,343, Or shall I call you Herman?
344,344," No. Please, call me Mank."
345,345," Good morning, Charles."
346,346, Charlie.
347,347, Aunt Marion. Mank.
348,348, You sleep well?
349,349,Until your rather dramatic wakeup call.
350,350,This is all Pops's idea.
351,351,He wants me ready to take on the talkies.
352,352,First positions!
353,353,"Riders, ready!"
354,354,Rolling!
355,355, Speed.
356,356, Speed! Action!
357,357,Help! Please! Someone save me!
358,358,Cut!
359,359,"Pops, this is Herman Mankiewicz, but we have to call him Mank."
360,360,Mankiewicz?
361,361,"Herman Mankiewicz, New York playwright and drama critic?"
362,362,"Turned humble screenwriter, Mr. Hearst."
363,363,"Why, no need to be humble, Mr. Mankiewicz."
364,364,Pictures that talk are the future.
365,365,"They're gonna need people who honor words, give them voice."
366,366,"There's a golden age coming when all the world will be a stage, and you, perhaps, their Shakespeare."
367,367,"Oh, I wouldn't have thought you'd be that keenly interested in the honoring of words."
368,368,What's so funny?
369,369,I'm just surprised that a vaunted muckraker like yourself sees Hollywood's future as such a shiny penny.
370,370,Back to one.
371,371,"Times are changing, Mr. Mankiewicz, and I'm not just referring to this Depression."
372,372,All that bother.
373,373,"And when all this is over, picturemakers are gonna have to service this new entertainment."
374,374,I intend to make pictures with the help of real literary minds.
375,375,"Mm, I support that."
376,376,"Instead, what do most studios give us?"
377,377,"Gangster flicks, zanies."
378,378,Too true.
379,379,"Now, how many gangsters do Americans meet in a lifetime?"
380,380,How many families are like the Marx Brothers?
381,381,You mean besides my own?
382,382,Very good. Have him seated next to me.
383,383,"Miss Davies, Mr. Hearst would like Mr. Mankiewicz seated to his left at dinner."
384,384,"Oh, Pops likes you."
385,385,"Why is it when Houseman edits, everyone ends up speaking like a constipated Oxford don?"
386,386,Hello?
387,387,"Yes, he is. No, not at all."
388,388,Please hold on. It's Poor Sa...
389,389,I'm sorry. It's your wife.
390,390, Schnutz.
391,391, I heard that.
392,392,"Hermie, Joe called four times in the last three days."
393,393, He wants your number up there.
394,394, So give it to him.
395,395,Knock it off!
396,396,The boys are remodeling.
397,397,He seemed concerned about something.
398,398,Is everything okay?
399,399,"If I could swim, I'd be doing swimmingly."
400,400,And don't mind Joe.
401,401, He's a worrisome old woman in disguise.
402,402," Well, he wants to offer you work."
403,403,Baby Joe offering me?
404,404,"Well, if he calls again, give him this number, Schnutz."
405,405,I've gotta run. Kiss the offspring.
406,406,"I sayâ¦ a letter from the gallant ""leftenant""?"
407,407,"Now, let's hope it makes more sense than the last."
408,408,Fighters off the decks of aircraft carriers.
409,409, Whoever had that idea?
410,410, It's not good?
411,411,Not good?
412,412,"German Uboats are starting to hunt in packs, and a Stuka divebomber can drop one down your stack from 500 feet."
413,413,What's our valiant laddie have to say for the cause...
414,414,It's not from her husband.
415,415,His ship's been sunk off Norway.
416,416,Presumed lost at sea.
417,417,Always the smartest guy in the room.
418,418,"You're right, of course."
419,419,"Aircraft carriers are a shitty idea, but I don't appreciate the callousness."
420,420,I expect more of you.
421,421,"""Presumed"" means they don't know, so I choose to believe he's alive untilâ¦ Mank."
422,422,Mank!
423,423,Mr. Mankiewicz?
424,424,He's all right. Just sleeping.
425,425,Wellâ¦ I shouldn't wonder.
426,426,There's enough Seconal in those bottles to bring down a bull elephant in heat.
427,427,Young Orson doesn't believe in chance.
428,428,"Houseman, you sly thing."
429,429,You slipped me a Mickey.
430,430,So we did.
431,431,"How you managed to reach it so early in your rehabilitation, I cannot imagine."
432,432,How was it? Mother's milk?
433,433,"On balance, better than nothing."
434,434,I plan to use it as a nightcap.
435,435,"As you Yanks say, ""He went out like a light."" I couldn't have put it better myself, which may be why I write for the movies."
436,436,Will you stop?
437,437,You write for the movies because you're super at it.
438,438,"Excuse me, you two, I've masses of typing to do."
439,439,Seventysix pages.
440,440,"By the time she translates your red chicken scratches, it'll be less than 40."
441,441,"At this rate, you'll never finish."
442,442,What I wanna know is what you think of it.
443,443,"The writing is firstrate, but you know that."
444,444,"His lust for power, your exquisite evocation of his hunger for love from those who fear his worst side, but..."
445,445,"The dreaded yet foreseeable ""but."" You're asking a lot of a motion picture audience."
446,446," All in all, it's a bit of a jumble."
447,447," Did you say ""jumble"" or ""jungle""?"
448,448,A hodgepodge of talky episodes.
449,449,"A collection of fragments that leap around in time, like Mexican jumping beans."
450,450,"Welcome to my mind, Old Sock."
451,451,"The story is so scattered, I'm afraid one will need a road map."
452,452,You mean it's a mess.
453,453,Would you consider simplifying?
454,454,"As Pascal once said, ""If only I'd had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."" All I am saying is no one can write like that."
455,455,"But I can write like that, Houseman."
456,456,I have.
457,457,"The narrative is one big circle, like a cinnamon roll, not a straight line pointing to the nearest exit."
458,458,You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours.
459,459,All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.
460,460,But nobody expects Shakespeare.
461,461,People aren't spending their hardearned 25 cents to see Macbeth.
462,462,Maestro the DogFaced Boy did Macbeth.
463,463,Voodoo Macbeth.
464,464,Don't be fooled. He's a showman.
465,465,Busker reveling in sleight of hand.
466,466,"Save yourself the trouble, be done in 60 days."
467,467,"He'll get this, and the audience will too."
468,468,Stop worrying. Have a pickle.
469,469,"No, thank you. I'm not hungry."
470,470,Haven't been since we got here.
471,471,Cheerio.
472,472,Write hard. Aim low.
473,473,"Where were we, chief?"
474,474,What are you gonna do?
475,475, About what?
476,476, He's right.
477,477,You won't be done till Christmas.
478,478, What?
479,479, You made a promise.
480,480, I did what?
481,481, Sixty days is two weeks from now.
482,482,Where were we?
483,483,"Bernstein's speech, the young woman on the ferry boat."
484,484,"Read it back, please."
485,485,"""A white dress she had on, and she was carrying a white parasol, and I only saw her for one second, and she didn't see me at all."" ""But I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl."" A snapshot from the Mankiewicz family album?"
486,486,You might say that.
487,487,It really is a gorgeous...
488,488,Spot to get stuck?
489,489,Is Bernstein meant to be Louis Mayer?
490,490,If form follows function.
491,491,Mayer is the same pathetic sort of lap dog to our Charles Foster?
492,492,Bernstein is a far nicer character.
493,493,You don't much like Mayer.
494,494,"If I ever go to the electric chair, I'd like him to be sitting in my lap."
495,495,$750 a week?
496,496,"That's half what you make, Herman."
497,497," You're a junior writer, Joe."
498,498, So?
499,499,"So, you're only half the wit your big brother is."
500,500, How many halfwits make that?
501,501," Herm, how do I look?"
502,502, You look like you. Fine.
503,503, What should I be expecting?
504,504,You're related to me.
505,505,He already thinks you're a genius.
506,506,Enough.
507,507,The job will be yours if you can do two things.
508,508,"One, don't roll your eyes."
509,509,"Two, try not to fall asleep."
510,510,This isn't Gower Gulch.
511,511,You want I should make a picture about a prostitute?
512,512,What's wrong?
513,513,My mother was nothing but a whore.
514,514,You would talk about your own mother that way?
515,515,The woman who gave you life?
516,516,You ungrateful bastard!
517,517,I ought to cut your balls off!
518,518,"Do it, you fucking junk dealer!"
519,519,I'll still be the better man!
520,520,"L.B., this is my brother, Joe."
521,521,"Nice to meet you, Joseph. I'm Louis Mayer."
522,522,"I can't tell you what this means to him, Louis."
523,523," They're all there, Mr. Mayer."
524,524," On my way. Joe, walk with me."
525,525,"My boy, there are three work rules at this studio."
526,526,Rule number one.
527,527,"Ars gratia artis, art for art's sake."
528,528,How you doing?
529,529,One million dollars a year we spend on stories we never even film.
530,530,Why not? I'll tell you.
531,531,They don't make me cry.
532,532,What makes me cry? Emotion.
533,533,Where do I feel emotion?
534,534,"Here, here, and here."
535,535,Rule number two.
536,536,You may have heard MGM has more stars than there are in the heavens.
537,537,Do not believe this.
538,538,Hiya. We have only one star.
539,539,That is Leo the Lion.
540,540,Never forget that.
541,541,"Many stars have, and now they twinkle elsewhere."
542,542,Rule number three.
543,543,People think MGM stands for MetroGoldwynMayer.
544,544,It does not.
545,545,"It stands for Mayer's gantze mishpokhe, Mayer's whole family."
546,546,Never forget that.
547,547,"You got a problem, come to Papa."
548,548,This is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory.
549,549,What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it.
550,550,"That's the real magic of the movies, and don't let anybody tell you different."
551,551,"I find myself in a horrendous position, and I come to all of you on bended knee."
552,552,"We are suffering, as all Americans are, from our country's terrible economic woes."
553,553,"Good people, everyday people, can't afford to go to the movies."
554,554,So even our preeminent dream factoryâ¦ is in grave financial difficulty.
555,555,I am asking everyone in the MGM family to take a painful step.
556,556,I am asking to roll back salaries.
557,557,"I don't want to, but for this hallowed place to continue to exist, I am forced to."
558,558,I won't break up this family over something like money.
559,559, How long are you asking for?
560,560, Shouldn't be long.
561,561, How much are you asking for?
562,562, Half.
563,563, Half?
564,564, Could be less.
565,565,Is everybody going to be pitching in?
566,566,"Are you, Mr. Mayer?"
567,567,"Real families root for each other in the good times, take care of each other in tough ones."
568,568,"We're with you, L.B."
569,569,"You may be, Mr. Barrymore, but a 50% pay cut for grips and electricians..."
570,570,"Eight weeks, my friends, eight short weeks."
571,571,"As soon as FDR reopens the banks, you'll get back every penny."
572,572,"On that, you have the sacred word of L.B. Mayer."
573,573,"Well, I vote yes."
574,574, I do as well.
575,575, Me too.
576,576," How'd I do, Ben?"
577,577," It was great, Mr. Mayer."
578,578,Ah.
579,579,Not even the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen.
580,580,Good.
581,581,Okay.
582,582, Yeah?
583,583," Oh, yeah."
584,584,Yeah? Okay.
585,585,Maybe a little bit left?
586,586, Yeah?
587,587, Yeah.
588,588,Here?
589,589," Ooh, yeah."
590,590, I've got to get typewriter ribbon.
591,591, Here are this morning's pages.
592,592, Dreck. It's all dreck!
593,593,Don't flagellate.
594,594,At least you're writing again.
595,595,None of it sings. None of it. Not a note.
596,596,You're not writing an opera.
597,597,Hello?
598,598,But I am writing an opera.
599,599,It's for you.
600,600, Yeah?
601,601," Herman, it's Joe."
602,602,"Hey, hey, kid. What's up?"
603,603, Checking in. How are you getting around?
604,604, Gingerly.
605,605, Any rest?
606,606, Haven't seen a sunrise yet.
607,607,You've never seen a sunrise.
608,608, Sara said you wanted this number.
609,609, Just to hear your voice.
610,610,Oh. She said you had some work you wanted to talk about.
611,611,"Ah. I was thinking about that old play, The Wild Man of Borneo, the one you wrote in the Ice Age."
612,612,One never remembers one's disasters.
613,613,It's considered gauche.
614,614,A play is never a disaster till the movies say it is.
615,615,I brought it to my people at the studio.
616,616,We want W.C. Fields.
617,617, We want you to adapt.
618,618, I'm kind of on something right now.
619,619,I can get you paid for the play and the adaptation.
620,620,Sounds great.
621,621,I'll have to think about it.
622,622,You know how these things have their moment.
623,623,So this isn't an offer.
624,624,It's a subtle ultimatum.
625,625,Nobody could ever tell you what to do.
626,626,Did Sara put you up to this?
627,627,"Not at all, but I know how things are."
628,628,I can tell by her voice.
629,629," And how bad is that, baby brother?"
630,630, How bad?
631,631,I went to a party last night where Scott Fitzgerald referred to you as a ruined man.
632,632,That's how bad things can get.
633,633,That's good. I may use that.
634,634, Hermie...
635,635," Please, stop, Joey."
636,636,Just tell me what's on your mind.
637,637,I hear you're hunting dangerous game.
638,638,"Word on the street is radio's golden boy wants to go toetotoe with Willie Hearst, and you're helping in the kitchen."
639,639,Oh?
640,640, And?
641,641," ""And?"" Herman, ""And?"" How stupid of me."
642,642,"I thought I was rejecting a humiliating handout, when all the time, I was nixing a respectable bribe."
643,643,And I'm sorry I ever cared.
644,644,Oops.
645,645,Come on.
646,646,Marion and I are pleased you all could come stay for the weekend.
647,647,I hope the train ride wasn't too arduous.
648,648,"And tonight, we're celebrating our great friend's birthday in our little hillside home. Charlie."
649,649,"âª Happy birthday to you âª âª Happy birthday to you âª âª Happy birthday, dear Louis âª âª Happy birthday to you âª Happy birthday!"
650,650,"Louis, you should be joyous."
651,651,You don't look a day over 48.
652,652,I feel 35.
653,653,"Mr. Hearst, Marion, all of you, my heart is full to bursting."
654,654,I can't express in wordsâ¦ Please don't try.
655,655,"W. R., nothing is more precious to me than your friendship and sage advice."
656,656,I am blessed to call you my friend.
657,657,God bless William Randolph Hearst.
658,658, Cheers.
659,659," God bless us, everyone."
660,660," Hear, hear."
661,661," A very happy birthday, Louis."
662,662,Our country should be flattered you picked its birth date as your own.
663,663,The rest of us have to be satisfied with the one we happen to be born on.
664,664,Mank.
665,665,Here's to your rich Canadian imagination.
666,666,Rich Canadian imagination!
667,667,Here's to banks reopening.
668,668, And to freedom.
669,669, Freedom!
670,670,"I believe you've met our distinguished guest, Mr. Rexford Tugwell."
671,671,"Now, Rex is special assistant to President Roosevelt, and we're all interested in what you might share with us."
672,672,We all wanna welcome the Thalbergs back from Irving's long convalescence in Europe.
673,673," Thank you, W.R."
674,674," Good to see you, Irving."
675,675," Thank you, Mr. Hearst."
676,676, Norma.
677,677,Anybody seen anything good lately?
678,678,I just saw 42nd Street. It blew my wig!
679,679,You can take the girl outta BedStuy.
680,680, When was that?
681,681, Over the weekend.
682,682,You were in D.C.
683,683,I went to the pictures in Santa Barbara.
684,684, We have a fine screening room here.
685,685, Warner's picture?
686,686,Why waste money on that?
687,687," Next time, I'll go with you."
688,688, Of course.
689,689,I am bonkers about Movietone News.
690,690,I love Lowell Thomas's voice.
691,691,"Oh, is he single?"
692,692,I sat across from him at the Brown Derby once.
693,693, He bought me a drink.
694,694, He didn't!
695,695,Not technically.
696,696,But I made sure to run into him in the parking lot after.
697,697," I asked him, ""Do you need a lift?""  You didn't! What did he say?"
698,698, I'll never tell.
699,699," There's a point to this, dear?"
700,700,"Well, yes, they showed that Hitler giving a speech, kissing babies."
701,701,He is creepers!
702,702,Lederhosen and suspenders. Terrifying.
703,703,"No, it's the mustache that's the horror."
704,704,"Don't be alarmed, Marion."
705,705,He won't be around for long.
706,706,"The Germans are a thoughtful, considerate people."
707,707,Enough about Nazis.
708,708,"Irving, tell us about your travels."
709,709,Where were you?
710,710,"Uhâ¦ Berlin, in fact."
711,711,But it was quite interesting.
712,712,"Thugs in brown shirts goosestepping past our hotel all night, screaming antiSemitic slogans."
713,713, I was terrified the whole time.
714,714, This Hitler sounds like an utter drip.
715,715,"Shouldn't the United States do something, Mr. Tugwell?"
716,716,We are weighing all options.
717,717,Can't last. Who in the world takes a lunatic like that seriously?
718,718,"Well, the last time I looked, Mank! You're always so wonderfully contrary."
719,719,"""Chase & Sanborn's der coffee."" ""Can 40 million Nazis all be wrong?"" I just read they've opened their first concentration camps and started burning books."
720,720, What's next? Movies?
721,721, Enough.
722,722," Is that true, Irving?"
723,723," Yes, L.B."
724,724,"Ah, Hitler, schmitler!"
725,725,You don't turn your back on a market as big as Germany.
726,726,Please. It's upsetting enough Marion had to endure the man in newsreel.
727,727,What's a concentration camp?
728,728,It was fascinating.
729,729,Those people adore him.
730,730, I'm probably talking nonsense.
731,731, You're the first tonight that isn't.
732,732,"Speaking of socialists, how about Upton Sinclair's book?"
733,733,No!
734,734,He wants to turn private enterprise over to the state.
735,735,There's one we won't be optioning.
736,736,"Eh, Irving?"
737,737,"Well, it's selling like crazy."
738,738,Walter Winchell says Sinclair may run for governor next election.
739,739,That rat Bolshevik belongs right up there with Hitler on the list of people not to be taken seriously.
740,740,There's a world of difference between communism and socialism.
741,741,They both want something for nothing.
742,742,Like a workforce for free?
743,743,"Half, and only in the interim."
744,744,I think it's safe to assume none of us here would welcome a crusading socialist as California's political savior.
745,745,"Certainly not FDR. Am I right, Rex?"
746,746,"Off the record, President says the man bears watching."
747,747,Especially now that Republicans seem bent on running Frank Merriam again.
748,748,"Sinclair's run twice before and got, what, 2% of the vote?"
749,749," Good people, the man is an author."
750,750, As was Thomas Jefferson.
751,751,"Ha! Come now, Mank."
752,752,Upton Sinclair as Thomas Jefferson?
753,753,"No, you're right, W.R."
754,754,"Jefferson never got federal laws passed to ban oil monopolies, or railroad trusts, or cleaned up the stockyards."
755,755," He's an angry scribe, a provocateur."
756,756, Because he provokes thought.
757,757,"You always side with the writer, Mank."
758,758,Poor souls surviving a depression on five grand a week.
759,759, Commies.
760,760, L.B. is not wrong.
761,761,"Irving, you're a literate man."
762,762,You know the difference between communism and socialism.
763,763,"In socialism, everyone shares the wealth."
764,764,"In communism, everyone shares the poverty."
765,765,"Thank you, Mr. Mankiewicz."
766,766,"Upton just wants you to apportion some of your Christmas bonus, Irving, to the people who clean your house."
767,767, Now that's why I always want Mank around.
768,768, Me too.
769,769,"Upton, Mank? Nobody's asking to hear you sing ""The Internationale.""  What's that?"
770,770," The Communist national anthem, darling."
771,771,I would. Do you sing?
772,772,No one should have to hear me sing.
773,773,"Isn't that right, Sara?"
774,774,If at all possible.
775,775,"As Republican state chairmanelect, I'm telling you, nothing's going to happen here."
776,776,The people who count in California won't let it.
777,777,All this talk is so much pissing in the wind.
778,778,Nicely put.
779,779,I heard Pops on the phone helping to pick the president's cabinet like casting a movie.
780,780,They can stop a guy like Sinclair.
781,781,"Couldn't you, Pops?"
782,782,Pardon.
783,783,I don't know what I'm saying.
784,784,Go.
785,785,"Hello, Tokyo?"
786,786,"London, you there?"
787,787," Ah, nerts!"
788,788, What is that?
789,789,"Oh, Pops's radiophones."
790,790,Never ever be out of touch with your empire.
791,791," No, no. What's ""nerts""?"
792,792," Nerts is Brooklynese for ""nuts."" Jeepers!"
793,793,What did I do that was so terrible?
794,794,"I shouldn't have said that thing about the cabinet in front of Tugwell, but since when does anybody care what I have to say?"
795,795,"Those things just pop out of my mouth, and the moment they do, I feel likeâ¦ Like you got caught, jambes en l'air."
796,796,No!
797,797,"Well, do you always just say whatever you think? Hmm."
798,798,You're blushing.
799,799, Am not.
800,800, Are too.
801,801, Am not.
802,802, Are too. I can see it even in the dark.
803,803,"Well, what can I tell you, Mank?"
804,804,Marion Dourasâ¦ went to convent school.
805,805,Hedda! Louella!
806,806,Where's a gossip columnist around this castle when you need one?
807,807,I hate shop talk.
808,808,I never know what's going on.
809,809,The one thing you never ever talk about is Upton Sinclair.
810,810,I noted.
811,811,"The moment he's mentioned, the evening turns."
812,812, It's sort of a sore subject.
813,813, Really?
814,814,Do tell.
815,815,"I don't even know who this Mr. Sinclair is, but he wrote about us for a book."
816,816,I used to quote it word for word.
817,817,"""I saw our richest newspaper publisher keep his movie mistress in a private city of palaces and cathedrals, furnished with shiploads of junk imported from Europe and surrounded by vast acres reserved for use by zebras and giraffes, telling in jest that he had spent six million dollars to make his lady's reputation and using his newspapers to celebrate her change of hats."" It must be hard to be on the receiving end of that."
818,818,"People think because you're on the cover of Modern Screen, they know you."
819,819, Hmm.
820,820," Ah, nerts!"
821,821,What do I have to complain about?
822,822,"I live in a fishbowl, but anything I want is mine."
823,823,"If I could, I'd share with everyone."
824,824,"You know that, Mank."
825,825,This Upton doesn't know a thing about the realâ¦ Nobody but nobody makes a monkey out of William Randolph Hearst!
826,826, I understand why Mayer loathes him.
827,827, Why?
828,828, Sinclair caught him with his pants down.
829,829, Yikes!
830,830,He wrote that Mayer took a bribe to look the other way so a rival could buy MGM.
831,831, It's complicated.
832,832, Over my head?
833,833,"No, over mine."
834,834,You'd need a degree in larceny.
835,835, Isn't bribery a crime?
836,836, That's what Sinclair said.
837,837,The little sausage might have gone to jail.
838,838,Jeepers!
839,839,The hypocrisy.
840,840,"""Mayn gantze mishpokhe. My mishpokhe.""  I don't speak a lot of Jewish."
841,841, Really?
842,842,"""My mishpokhe. My family."" Everything he does is for family, except when it comes to selling his last name to a competitor in the middle of the night."
843,843,Wow. He would do that to his own studio?
844,844,He doesn't own MGM any more than Sam Goldwyn.
845,845,They just run it for the moneyboys back East.
846,846,And jail is not something an animal like Mayer is likely to forget.
847,847,Irving must be clean.
848,848,He looks like he shaves three times a day.
849,849,"Well, there's clean, and there's clean."
850,850,Irving bought one of Sinclair's novels.
851,851,"Sinclair demanded a guarantee that not one word could be changed, in writing, on the back of the purchase check."
852,852,He didn't want notes from Irving Thalberg?
853,853,"When Thalberg refused, Sinclair took his money and ran off to Mexico and financed a picture about the Russian Revolution."
854,854,"Now, that's sticking the old neck out."
855,855,Oh.
856,856,Oh.
857,857,I'm sorry. Instinct!
858,858,My fault.
859,859,I've been a little sixes and sevens recently.
860,860,"Tell me something, Mank. The truth."
861,861,Could you see me playing Elizabeth Barrett Browning or Marie Antoinette?
862,862,"Irving's bought 'em both, you know, because of Pops."
863,863,What do you think?
864,864,And honestly.
865,865,I see you more as Dulcinea.
866,866, Who?
867,867, Dulcinea.
868,868,"From the Spanish, for sweetness."
869,869,Ah.
870,870,"""Her hair, gold. Her cheeks, roses."" Nice."
871,871," ""Her lips, coral.""  Mmm."
872,872,"""Her neck, alabaster. Her bosom, marble."" Marble?"
873,873,Maybe once.
874,874,"""Ivory, her hands, and her whiteness, snow.""  You wrote that?"
875,875, No. A fella named Cervantes.
876,876,"""There are meters of accent and meters of tone, but the best of all meters is to meet her alone.""  Ah, a poem with a message."
877,877, That's just the first verse.
878,878,"The lastâ¦ ""There are letters of accent and letters of tone, but the best of all letters is to let her alone."" Now, those I wrote."
879,879,Do come in.
880,880, Jesus! What is that?
881,881, Sunlight. It's nearly noon.
882,882,Mother of God! Where did the night go?
883,883, Your support device is here.
884,884," Oh, good. Send it in."
885,885,As is Mr. Houseman.
886,886,What would you like me to do?
887,887,"Well, send him in too."
888,888,"Uh, put it over there, please."
889,889, You're early.
890,890, I thought we should talk.
891,891, Why are you wearing a coat?
892,892, I always wear a coat.
893,893,Must be 108 degrees.
894,894," We're at a Rubicon moment, Mank."
895,895, Uhhuh.
896,896,It's not the work.
897,897,That's everything we hoped it would be.
898,898, Enough room there?
899,899," Oh, it should be."
900,900,"I'm sorry, John."
901,901, You've only written ninety pages.
902,902, Ninetyone.
903,903,"In my expert opinion, you're hardly out of the first act."
904,904,"I mean, how do you hope to be done in 14â¦ 13 days?"
905,905,We gave him our solemn word we would deliver.
906,906," ""We""?"
907,907, I don't think he's going to take it well.
908,908,Not very well at all.
909,909,You said 90 days. Welles said 60.
910,910,I'm doing the very best I can.
911,911, We are surely to be axed.
912,912, Not just yet.
913,913,I've never been fired.
914,914, I've never not been fired.
915,915, I don't get fired.
916,916,It's not as unpleasant as you might imagine.
917,917,"You worry too much, John."
918,918,What do you do for pleasure?
919,919,"Hello? Yes, he's here."
920,920,It's Orson.
921,921,Will you talk?
922,922,He'd like to speak with Mr. Houseman.
923,923,Me?
924,924,Orson.
925,925,"I came early to see where we were with, uhâ¦ No, not at all."
926,926,"Everything's going absolutely accordingâ¦ Well, that's difficult to say exactly."
927,927,"Yep. Yes, I know the clockâ¦ Well, as I've told you, it's quite unique."
928,928,"In fact, I would venture to say, one of the mostâ¦ Yes, well, it will absolutely need your marvelousâ¦ He's on the mend, working tirelessly."
929,929,Of course. When?
930,930,I'm on my way.
931,931,Yes. Hang on. He's right here.
932,932,He wants to see me right away.
933,933,Wouldn't tell me why.
934,934,Perhaps he will you.
935,935, Orson.
936,936," Tell me what's up, Mank."
937,937,He's getting on my nerves.
938,938,I sensed that.
939,939,I told him I had to see him at once.
940,940,"Hopefully, I can think of a reason before he gets here."
941,941,I've finished my test for Heart of Darkness.
942,942,I'm turning my full attention to our little project.
943,943,"""Let there be light.""  Tell me what to expect."
944,944, I thought you'd want to be surprised.
945,945,Ha. You're always surprising.
946,946,That's why you were my only choice.
947,947,No one else is Mankiewicz.
948,948,I can almost hear the finish line.
949,949, We're about to turn a corner.
950,950, Unto the breach!
951,951,"Slim, you may tote those lovely highland beauties to the kitchen."
952,952,"Fraulein Freda, empty the Mickeys and start replacing their contents, raus schnell."
953,953," Thank you, Slim. You may go."
954,954, Slim.
955,955,"Mr. Mankiewicz, please don't ask us to help you in this sad deception."
956,956,"My dear Mrs. Alexander, Charlie Lederer and I went to a great deal of trouble to engineer this sad deception."
957,957,My deadline is two weeks away and I intend...
958,958,It could mean our jobs.
959,959,I do my best thinking before I fall asleep.
960,960,And I am sick and tired of having my evenings end with the abrupt sensation of being struck on the head with a croquet mallet.
961,961, A way to put it.
962,962, I'm not asking you to help.
963,963, You're not?
964,964, I'm telling you.
965,965,I'm sorry. I won't be bullied.
966,966,You'll have my resignation in the morning.
967,967,I know Freda's been sneaking you nightcaps from the cabinet.
968,968,"If she continues to cooperate in this cheap ruse, I'll have to report the both of you."
969,969, Fraulein Freda.
970,970," Ja, Herr Mank?"
971,971, Please do as I instructed.
972,972," Ja, Herr Mank."
973,973,Humph.
974,974,"Freda, you mustn't let him intimidate you."
975,975," I am not intimidated, Frau Alexander."
976,976," Then, why?"
977,977,Herr Mank sponsored my family's entry into this country.
978,978,"He's responsible for us getting safely out of Germany, legally and financially."
979,979, Really?
980,980," Our entire village, he brought here."
981,981, Entire village?
982,982, Over 100 people.
983,983,"Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister, will not allow his films to be shown in the Fatherland."
984,984,I didn't realize.
985,985,"He wrote a picture about the Nazis, which no studio anywhere will dare make."
986,986,"I assume if he wishes to drink, he's a grown man, a good man, and should be treated as such."
987,987,Nicht wahr?
988,988,To Manktown. Or is it Mankville?
989,989,Dear Freda.
990,990,What's German for blabbermouth?
991,991,"Either you demonstrate you can handle this, or we will all end up getting sacked."
992,992,There's nothing like a vote of confidence from one's peers.
993,993,To Mankberg. Prosit.
994,994,Mankheim. Bottoms up.
995,995,"Hey, Mank, you remember me?"
996,996,"Oh, my God."
997,997,"Of course I remember you, C.C."
998,998,C.C. for Central Casting.
999,999,"How you been, Mank?"
1000,1000,What happened?
1001,1001,What happened?
1002,1002,The goddamn Depression happened.
1003,1003,I ain't had so much as a walkon since Tugboat Annie.
1004,1004,"Listen. I hate to, you knowâ¦ Uh, yeah. Ed, lend me a buck."
1005,1005,"Uh, me and Grady here been thinking of bummin' east to Miami."
1006,1006,"I heard it from someone who knows, the Hollywood studios are movin' to Florida."
1007,1007, Who told you that?
1008,1008," Oh, I can't say."
1009,1009,Somebody in the know.
1010,1010,"In certain echelons, it's common knowledge."
1011,1011,"Well, people in certain echelons don't usually trust me with sensitive information."
1012,1012,But the studios aren't moving anywhere.
1013,1013,That's just companytown propaganda.
1014,1014,"Believe what you want, but say, you think you could spareâ¦ Uhâ¦ Ed?"
1015,1015,"Bless you, Mank."
1016,1016,The bastard reneged. You were there.
1017,1017,"Yes, he reinstated salaries, but he never gave back the money he promised."
1018,1018,Giant surprise.
1019,1019,"Come on, Mank. We need guys like you to keep people like Mayer honest."
1020,1020,"I'd refer you, for that, to the power of prayer."
1021,1021,"The Writers Guild doesn't have to hit the bricks for the $2,500aweek guy."
1022,1022,We're doing it for the $250aweek guy.
1023,1023,"Joe, all the $250aweek writers I know are getting $2,500."
1024,1024,"Stop crying for your just deserts, or they're liable to give them to you."
1025,1025,Then we'll all be working for 75 bucks a week.
1026,1026,I don't know if you've ever walked a picket line. You might have to.
1027,1027,And Dave Chasen will cater.
1028,1028,"""Junior writers only paid $750 a week."" If that happens, you'd better run before real folk with real troubles stone you to death."
1029,1029,"Hermie, the guild's in its infancy."
1030,1030, It needs you.
1031,1031, You're telling me.
1032,1032,What writer failed to notice the Screen Writers Guild needs an apostrophe?
1033,1033,"As Groucho always said, ""Never belong to any club that would have someone like you for a member."" And look at him."
1034,1034,The most miserable bastard on God's green earth.
1035,1035,"I'd tell him you said that, only he'd think you were brownnosing."
1036,1036,Close the door.
1037,1037,Ahâ¦ summer.
1038,1038,"Inez, you are not to let the Brothers Marx wait in my office. Ever."
1039,1039,They've been grilling hot dogs again.
1040,1040,Sit down.
1041,1041,You wanted to see me?
1042,1042,"Not that I care, but why aren't you contributing to MGM's antiSinclair fund?"
1043,1043,"Well, call me oldfashioned, Irving, but I don't like being told which side of a fight I'm already on."
1044,1044,How's it gonna look if the GOP chairman himself can't get unanimous support from his own studio?
1045,1045,You're serious.
1046,1046,"I was taught by my parents to be straightforward, to ask simply for what I want, and expect that I may have to elucidate my position."
1047,1047,"Well, I was encouraged by mine to use my imagination, but I taught myself to avoid the consequences."
1048,1048,"It's ten bucks, Mank."
1049,1049,You piss that away between hopeless bets.
1050,1050,I hate to think what L.B. might do if he knew you were the only holdout.
1051,1051," I am, and he doesn't?"
1052,1052, And we're not gonna tell him.
1053,1053, I could let you go for this.
1054,1054, It is a hanging offense.
1055,1055,I'll add the appropriate amount to your gambling debt and forget we ever had this conversation.
1056,1056,You do that.
1057,1057,"And the brandspankingnew Writers Guild might find it very interesting, not to mention the newspapers."
1058,1058,I'm not sure the guild intends to cover games of chance.
1059,1059,"And you won't go to the press, because in California, that means Hearst."
1060,1060,"Irving, you are the shrewdest executive in this town."
1061,1061,Why are you acting like some dumb ward heeler?
1062,1062,You don't need my donation.
1063,1063,You don't need anybody's.
1064,1064,You have everything it takes right here.
1065,1065,Meaning?
1066,1066,Meaning you can make the world swear King Kong is ten stories tall and Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.
1067,1067,Yet you can't convince starving voters that a turncoat socialist is a menace to everything Californians hold dear?
1068,1068,You're barely trying.
1069,1069,"Millions of Californians are being taxed out of their homes, yet the Depression is one of abundance."
1070,1070,Fruit rots on the ground and vegetables are dumped into the ocean because there are no markets for them.
1071,1071,"Aimee Semple McPherson says you're a godless commie, Upton."
1072,1072,"Too often, sir, the religion of Jesus is used by the ruling classes to keep themselves in power and the poor ever poorer."
1073,1073,"And that, my friends, is a sin and an error."
1074,1074,"And I say with Thomas Jefferson, ""Truth has nothing to fear from error where reason is left free to combat it."" My friends, income in this country is going to be redistributed by one of two methods, legal enactment or violent revolution."
1075,1075,We haven't much longer to exercise our choice.
1076,1076,Thank you all for coming.
1077,1077,Tell us about Hollywood!
1078,1078,Are the studios moving to Florida like they've been saying?
1079,1079,"Absurd, sir."
1080,1080,"If they were serious, why have the brothers Warner broken ground on an additional While MGM has the most contracts with stars in their history."
1081,1081,"Well, he may not get Mayer's voteâ¦ Jobs will be hereâ¦ â¦but he gets mine."
1082,1082,â¦in California.
1083,1083,Thank you all for coming.
1084,1084,"Well, I have seen some miracles in my day, but I have over 200 pages in 13 days."
1085,1085,I never would've thought it possible.
1086,1086, To support devices.
1087,1087, Support devices.
1088,1088,"It's good, Mank. Damn good."
1089,1089,I have it on highest authority it's the best thing he's ever done.
1090,1090,"As a moving picture, it's more than good."
1091,1091,I'm at a loss to even express how wealth and influence can crush a man.
1092,1092,It's Lear. The dark night of the soul.
1093,1093,And I was completely mistaken.
1094,1094,The shifting point of view is revolutionary.
1095,1095,I never thought one could care so much about a sled.
1096,1096,It's kind of you to say.
1097,1097,But.
1098,1098,"""But,"" again."
1099,1099,It's 327 pages.
1100,1100,An embarrassment of riches.
1101,1101,"When the DogFaced Boy gets here, there will be plenty of branches to prune."
1102,1102,"""A far too long screenplay for the ages."" John Houseman."
1103,1103,I built him a watertight narrative and a suggested destination.
1104,1104,"Where he takes it, that's his job."
1105,1105,"I was, uh, looking to get you paid."
1106,1106,I don't know if you were aware or not.
1107,1107,You signed your rights to the Mercury.
1108,1108,You agreed not to take screen credit.
1109,1109, I needed the work.
1110,1110, You may want to reconsider.
1111,1111,"All I currently want is a real shower, a cocktail, and my Sara to wake up to."
1112,1112,Are you certain?
1113,1113,It worked out.
1114,1114,"Mank, if I may be so bold, why Hearst?"
1115,1115,"Lord knows, outside his own blonde Betty Boop, you were always his favorite dinner partner."
1116,1116,"John, are you familiar with the parable of the organ grinder's monkey?"
1117,1117,"Today, our roving reporter is visiting Mrs. Elsie Hammontree of Azusa."
1118,1118,"Elsie, would you mind telling the folks at home why you're voting Republican?"
1119,1119,"Young man, I'm a widow, and this little home may not be much, but it's all I have left."
1120,1120, And I intend to protect it.
1121,1121, Poor old woman.
1122,1122,Would you mind telling folks why you're voting for Frank Merriam?
1123,1123,"Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam because I wanna keep our way of lifeâ¦ I know that voice."
1124,1124,It is familiar.
1125,1125,That's Maude Anderson.
1126,1126, I don't know muchâ¦  It is. Aunt Bertha from Lonely Trails.
1127,1127,"Well, she's no widow."
1128,1128,And she's absurdly rich.
1129,1129,"That ""poor old woman"" has got enough oil wells south of El Segundo to buy us both, Schnutz."
1130,1130,I'd know that whiskey gargle anywhere.
1131,1131,"Hey, Mank."
1132,1132,"Well, well."
1133,1133,"Looks like you found work, C.C."
1134,1134,"Don't nose it around, but yeah, just in the nick."
1135,1135, Who's hiring?
1136,1136, MGM.
1137,1137,They cleaned out the Washington and Culver gates like a dose of ExLax.
1138,1138,Grady gets a speaking part.
1139,1139,They told us to come dressed as we are.
1140,1140,"I don't know who thought of it, but it keeps a lot of us off the streets."
1141,1141,Don't forget to vote.
1142,1142,Okay.
1143,1143,He's confused with Sinclair Lewis.
1144,1144,"So many hicks think he wrote Elmer Gantry, it's cost him the Dust Bowl vote."
1145,1145,I'm in.
1146,1146,Poor sap.
1147,1147,"Not only has he got no money, he's an idealist, for Christ's sakes."
1148,1148,Talk about political handicaps. I'm out.
1149,1149,"Times says he'll lose by 200,000."
1150,1150,It's amazing what $10 million against him bought.
1151,1151,Raise.
1152,1152,That's what he gets for surrounding himself with amateurs.
1153,1153,"They not only charge admission to rallies, they pass a plate once the suckers are inside."
1154,1154,Call.
1155,1155,"He's the most famous schlub after FDR, Hitler, and Mussolini."
1156,1156,That oughta count for something.
1157,1157," Hiya, Shell, sit in."
1158,1158, The bookies know.
1159,1159,"Soon as old Maude's radio spots started running, the odds went from 75 for to 21 against."
1160,1160,Could you effete political snobs please shut up and play?
1161,1161,"Mank, can I talk to you?"
1162,1162,I'll see you guys and bump you two big ones.
1163,1163,It's important.
1164,1164,"What, now, Shelly?"
1165,1165,It better be.
1166,1166,That's the first good hand I've had all day.
1167,1167,I didn't know he knew what a good hand looked like.
1168,1168,I'm out.
1169,1169,Mind telling who you favor in this election?
1170,1170,I'm going to vote for Frank Merriam.
1171,1171,Tell us your principal reason.
1172,1172,"Well, I want Merriam because I want a job."
1173,1173,"If you drive all the capital out of the country, who's gonna pay us?"
1174,1174,You think Merriam would be safest for all of us?
1175,1175,Absolutely.
1176,1176,It's no time to trade horses in the middle of a stream.
1177,1177,"Mr. Butler, are you voting in the election?"
1178,1178, I am.
1179,1179, Who would you vote for?
1180,1180,I'm sure that I'm gonna vote for Mr. Sinclair.
1181,1181,You must have a good reason.
1182,1182,Mr. Sinclair's got something new.
1183,1183,He got that EPIC Plan.
1184,1184,I feel as though it's time we should try something new out again.
1185,1185,I need prosperity.
1186,1186,"Well, first of all, I'm an American, and I believe that Mr. Merriam will support all the foundations and principles that this country has stood for in the past 150 years."
1187,1187,"I have a job now, and I wanna keep it."
1188,1188,"My wife and I love California, and we'd like to stay."
1189,1189,"But in case we should have to leave, I'd like to have at least a couple dollars."
1190,1190,Cut.
1191,1191,"Mrs. Hammontree, tell the folks why you're voting for Frank Merriam."
1192,1192,"Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam because I wanna keep our way of life."
1193,1193,A Democrat wouldn't protect your way of life?
1194,1194,"Why, that man's a socialist."
1195,1195,"I don't know much about politics, but I do know this."
1196,1196,"If Upton Sinclair wins this election, private ownership in California won't amount to a hill o' beans."
1197,1197,"Well, we need complete rejuvenation of our system, so I vote for Comrade Upton."
1198,1198,"His system work in Russia, why not here?"
1199,1199,Cut. Do it again.
1200,1200,What'd you think?
1201,1201,"Truthfully, Shelly, if the performances were any better, you'd be ashamed of yourself."
1202,1202,Only half of 'em were actors.
1203,1203,"It's got that raw newsreel feel, hasn't it?"
1204,1204, But it isn't news and it isn't real.
1205,1205, I wasn't looking for an ethical debate.
1206,1206, When did they cook this up?
1207,1207, At a meeting in production.
1208,1208,"They were passing around a pamphlet Sinclair wrote called ""Ending Poverty inâ¦"" ""America's unemployed will invade the Golden State.""  Mayer was giddy to use it against him."
1209,1209," Yeah, I bet he was."
1210,1210,It's enough to persuade me that a writer is more of a menace to an unsuspecting public than a party hack.
1211,1211, Manky...
1212,1212, You okay?
1213,1213,Just nerves.
1214,1214,"If it's bothering you, Shelly, why get involved?"
1215,1215,They gave me a chance to direct.
1216,1216,You don't think anyone old enough to vote is gonna buy this shit?
1217,1217,Only the ones who believe King Kong is ten stories tall or Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.
1218,1218,"Thanks, Cedric. These are fine."
1219,1219,I've just watched our Sinclair films.
1220,1220,Ah. What did you think?
1221,1221,"With all due respect to Shelly, King Kong they ain't."
1222,1222,Though I do think footage of invading hobos has a certain xenophobic power when frontpaged in the Times and backed by those tacky billboards.
1223,1223,"Shelly got a chance to direct, and I canceled your $12,000 gambling debt."
1224,1224,I'd call that a fair return on a oneminute lecture for uninspired studio chieftains.
1225,1225,Your director's been stricken with a bout of conscience.
1226,1226,I'm sure he'll tell me himself.
1227,1227,"Don't do this, Irving."
1228,1228,"When I was just a boy passing out socialist leaflets in the Bronx, a couple Tammany goons came to show me the error of my ways."
1229,1229,And one of them crushed my testicles until I volunteered to distribute my wares into the East River.
1230,1230,"That's politics. I didn't invent it, I don't apologize for it."
1231,1231,Mayer's not paying for this.
1232,1232,He never pays for anything.
1233,1233,Willie?
1234,1234, Marion might be interested.
1235,1235," Well, you're gonna have to hurry."
1236,1236,Mayer's over there now giving her the company kissoff.
1237,1237,"Oh, haven't you heard?"
1238,1238,She's taking her playpen to Warner Bros. Permanently.
1239,1239,Warner's?
1240,1240,I wouldn't let her do Marie Antoinette.
1241,1241,Goldwyn's right for once.
1242,1242,"""A comedienne in that role is to laugh."" Besides, her pictures haven't made a dime in a decade."
1243,1243,"Congratulations, Irving."
1244,1244,"I know what I am, Mank."
1245,1245,"When I come to work, I don't consider it slumming."
1246,1246,I don't use humor to keep myself above the fray.
1247,1247,And I go to the mat for what I believe in.
1248,1248,I haven't the time to do otherwise.
1249,1249,"But you, sir, how formidable people like you might be if they actually gave at the office."
1250,1250,Close the door.
1251,1251,"Oh, that's a beautiful shot right there."
1252,1252,Mank! Are you okay?
1253,1253,"No, that almost killed me."
1254,1254,Where's Willie?
1255,1255,"Cairo, I think."
1256,1256, Can you phone him?
1257,1257," I don't phone him, he phones me."
1258,1258,When's he due back?
1259,1259,After November 6th.
1260,1260,I'm joining him in Europe next week.
1261,1261,"Marion, I need a favor."
1262,1262,It's just a little joke on Willie.
1263,1263,"Sure, Mank, anything."
1264,1264,I want you to go back and tell Mayer Willie wants the phony Sinclair films pulled.
1265,1265,Which phony Sinclair films?
1266,1266,There isn't time to explain.
1267,1267,I just need you to tell him that.
1268,1268,"Oh, I couldn't, not even as a joke."
1269,1269, Why not?
1270,1270, You know I don't lie.
1271,1271,And that's why he'd believe you.
1272,1272,"Marion, please, you're not in convent school anymore."
1273,1273," I'm sorry. Iâ¦ I know it's silly, but..."
1274,1274, But what? Why not?
1275,1275, Promise you won't laugh.
1276,1276, I promise I won't laugh.
1277,1277, My exit.
1278,1278, What?
1279,1279,I already made my exit.
1280,1280, Manky!
1281,1281, Whatie?
1282,1282, It's an ashthroated flycatcher!
1283,1283, Congratulations! Best kind.
1284,1284,What can I say?
1285,1285,She's my aunt.
1286,1286," Oh, it's not about her, it's about him."
1287,1287, Oh?
1288,1288," Or rather, it's him, but it's not her."
1289,1289, It isn't?
1290,1290,"The lonely showgirl, trapped in a castle, doing jigsaw puzzles."
1291,1291,"It's more, her as people who don't know her imagine her to be."
1292,1292,I see.
1293,1293,"It's her as they imagine her, but it's him as you knew him."
1294,1294," Damn it, Charlie."
1295,1295, You asked me out here.
1296,1296,I was honored to come and read your latest.
1297,1297, Is this a test?
1298,1298, A test? Of what?
1299,1299, Friendship? Loyalty?
1300,1300," Oh, come now."
1301,1301,Or just your way of avoiding responsibility?
1302,1302,What do you mean?
1303,1303,Are you hoping I might absolve you of such a personal betrayal?
1304,1304,I won't give you that.
1305,1305,Are you going to say anything?
1306,1306, I have to think about it.
1307,1307, Why?
1308,1308,'Cause I haven't made up my mind how she might react.
1309,1309,What does instinct tell you?
1310,1310,It's mighty strong medicine for a lifetime of starryeyed selfabsorption.
1311,1311,It's one of those cures that could be worse than the disease.
1312,1312,"But you, of all people, should know about that."
1313,1313,He took the script?
1314,1314,Uhhuh.
1315,1315,Will he show it to her?
1316,1316,I don't know.
1317,1317,Do you want him to?
1318,1318,I don't know.
1319,1319,Sinclair is yesterday's fishwrap.
1320,1320,Never stood a chance.
1321,1321,Make up your mind.
1322,1322,Are we home licking our wounds or here making the best of it?
1323,1323,We're making the best of it.
1324,1324, Good evening. Name?
1325,1325, Mankiewicz.
1326,1326,"Sorry, what was that?"
1327,1327,"MANKIEWIC, and outta nowhere, a Z."
1328,1328, Table 14.
1329,1329, Ends of the earth. Clean exit.
1330,1330,"Mankiewicz, Herman."
1331,1331,"Oh, terribly sorry."
1332,1332,Table one. Right this way.
1333,1333,"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
1334,1334, Table one.
1335,1335, Sara!
1336,1336,Good grief. Look who's here.
1337,1337,How about that?
1338,1338, Sara.
1339,1339, What a loyal friend you are.
1340,1340, I never thought we would see Mank.
1341,1341, I'm surprised.
1342,1342,I would've imagined you in pajamas by now.
1343,1343,"Mank, turns out we have the same dentist on Camden."
1344,1344,"Sara, we have to plan a day of shopping and catch up."
1345,1345,"Herman, I met your brother."
1346,1346,He's a chip off the old block.
1347,1347,Quite handsome.
1348,1348,"Please, sit."
1349,1349,I can't tell you how much it means.
1350,1350,I'm touched you'd come.
1351,1351, Thank you.
1352,1352, Oh.
1353,1353,Why do I love you?
1354,1354,What's everyone else having?
1355,1355, What a great night. Great result.
1356,1356, I'll drink to that.
1357,1357,"You see, if you just give people what they need to know in an emotional way, you can expect they'll do the right thing."
1358,1358,"I think what you mean, ""If you keep telling people something untrue, loud and long enough, they're apt to believe it."" That's not what he was saying."
1359,1359,What's going on here?
1360,1360,Are we quoting Goebbels?
1361,1361, I'd like to debate that with L.B.
1362,1362, I'd like to see that.
1363,1363,Mank. Have another.
1364,1364,It's early. Every vote counts.
1365,1365,Maybe the informed of California were late leaving work.
1366,1366,"The last I heard, Irving, it's still a democracy."
1367,1367, Of the people.
1368,1368, By the people.
1369,1369,What are you two talking about?
1370,1370,"I tell you what, how aboutâ¦ double or nothin'?"
1371,1371, What's he saying?
1372,1372, Herman.
1373,1373,You really will bet on anything.
1374,1374,Keep your money. I'm happy enough just to nail that utopian son of a bitch to the wall.
1375,1375,I told you. Your obligation was canceled out of gratitude.
1376,1376,Wait a minute. What?
1377,1377,He wants to wager double or nothin' on a debt he doesn't even owe us?
1378,1378,Mank.
1379,1379,"It's a matter of principle, L.B."
1380,1380,You wouldn't understand.
1381,1381,I understand plenty. I'll take that bet.
1382,1382,"Okay, Mank, you're on."
1383,1383,Twentyfour grand or nothing.
1384,1384,Excuse me.
1385,1385,I'm going to throw up.
1386,1386,I needed some air.
1387,1387,Why do you love me?
1388,1388,"Excuse me, friends."
1389,1389,"The final, incomplete, count for tonight isâ¦ Upton Sinclair, the lousy Bolshevikâ¦ â¦728,653."
1390,1390,"Frank Merriamâ¦ â¦the good Republican, My friends! My friends!"
1391,1391,Everybody get up and sing with me!
1392,1392,"Sing with me! Everybody, up and sing!"
1393,1393,âª O beautiful for spacious skies âª It was a team effort. Thanks.
1394,1394,"âª For amber waves of grain âª âª For purple mountain majestiesâ¦ âª Uh, Mr. Mankiewicz, I'm so sorry to bother you, but there's a telephone call for you."
1395,1395,Right back this way.
1396,1396,âª Americaâ¦ âª  Hello.
1397,1397," Mank, it's Shelly."
1398,1398,It's Shelly.
1399,1399," He lost, Mank."
1400,1400," Yeah, it's been a bad night."
1401,1401,It's my fault.
1402,1402," Oh, easy, fella, you only voted once."
1403,1403, He was just on the radio.
1404,1404,He said the phony newsreels cost him the election.
1405,1405,That shows how naive he is.
1406,1406,FDR cost him the election by staying on the sidelines.
1407,1407, Sleep it off.
1408,1408, I'm not at home.
1409,1409,Where are you? Let me call you a cab.
1410,1410,Never mind.
1411,1411,I'll take the Pasadena Freeway.
1412,1412,Nobody'd be on it election night.
1413,1413,Hello?
1414,1414,Hello?
1415,1415, How may I direct your call?
1416,1416," Normandie, 4761."
1417,1417,He's shitfaced.
1418,1418,"Shell, is that you?"
1419,1419,It's Herman Mankiewicz. Where is he?
1420,1420,I don't know. I'm so worried.
1421,1421,"He left here very upset, and he's got a pistol with him."
1422,1422,"Don't worry, Fay. I'll find him."
1423,1423, Eve.
1424,1424, What?
1425,1425, I'm Eve. Fay was his first.
1426,1426, I'll find him.
1427,1427,Is Houseman coming back?
1428,1428,I never thought I'd miss him.
1429,1429,He and the wunderkind are cutting the first draft.
1430,1430,A form of creative vivisection.
1431,1431,"Vital organs are exposed, nothing is learned, the patient dies on the table."
1432,1432,What have we here?
1433,1433,"Why, it's a puffedup, sharptailed, redruffled magpie."
1434,1434,A whatie?
1435,1435, How do you like the Mojave?
1436,1436, God's answer for drunks and reprobates.
1437,1437,Perfect place to dry out.
1438,1438, How's that working?
1439,1439, It didn't take. Cheers.
1440,1440,L'chaim.
1441,1441,"Why are you doing this, Herm?"
1442,1442, Posterity.
1443,1443," Posterity, my ass."
1444,1444, From the original Latin.
1445,1445, Don't patronize me.
1446,1446,My Latin grades were better than yours.
1447,1447,"Bibamus, moriendum est."
1448,1448,I read your little script.
1449,1449,News travels fast.
1450,1450,"Even without the title page, you don't need to be Philip Marlowe to know who wrote it."
1451,1451,Have at it.
1452,1452,It's veryâ¦ complicated.
1453,1453,"Well, thanks for coming out."
1454,1454,"Herman, this is me."
1455,1455,"You pick a fight with Willie, you are finished."
1456,1456,Mayer can't save you. Nobody can.
1457,1457,Especially the boy genius from New York.
1458,1458," You're far too political, Joe."
1459,1459, Selfpreservation is not politics.
1460,1460,"Him, I get."
1461,1461,But what did Marion ever do to deserve this?
1462,1462,It's not her!
1463,1463,"You know better than anyone, not all characters are headliners."
1464,1464,Some are secondary.
1465,1465,"Well, that's why I'm here."
1466,1466,On behalf of the secondary characters.
1467,1467,"I thought you'd wanna know there's a rumor in town you're out to get Hearst because they dropped you from L.B.'s payroll, that they didn't want you around anymore."
1468,1468,Don't believe everything you hear at Schwab's.
1469,1469,"Hey, you made yourself court jester."
1470,1470,Someone had to say it.
1471,1471,People are speculating Rosebud is W.R.'s pet name for Marion's genitalia.
1472,1472,"Now, I know you'd never stoop to that."
1473,1473,Only because I hadn't heard.
1474,1474,Charlie tells me you're up for Thalberg's old job.
1475,1475, Not anymore.
1476,1476, Did I bollix that?
1477,1477,"Don't flatter yourself, Herman."
1478,1478,I did it all alone.
1479,1479,"Now, there's a first."
1480,1480,"I exposed myself, not entirely metaphorically, in court."
1481,1481,Do tell.
1482,1482,Somebody was bitching about Mervyn LeRoy running over budget on Wizard of Oz.
1483,1483, Goddamn movie again.
1484,1484," I said, ""Le Roy s'amuse."" I was then forced to spend the next 20 minutes having to explain that ""Le Roy"" is ""le roi"" in French and means ""the king."" Or to be specific, FranÃ§ois I, and his royal habit of s'amusing himself by diddling all the ladies of his court."
1485,1485,"You know, Pop was right."
1486,1486,You should've been a professor.
1487,1487,Nobody knew what the fuck I was talking about.
1488,1488,They say I was passed over because I'm not a team player.
1489,1489,But I know better.
1490,1490,It was the goddamn French pun that did me in.
1491,1491,"I'm washed up, Joe."
1492,1492,Have been for years.
1493,1493,It's the best thing you've ever written.
1494,1494,"A rare bird, that."
1495,1495,A Mankiewicz.
1496,1496, You can't do it that way.
1497,1497, Do what?
1498,1498,Kill yourself. I've tried. It takes years.
1499,1499,I was tired of doing inserts and pickup shots.
1500,1500,You're not the first person to trade integrity for a chance in the big chair.
1501,1501,Thalberg said this was your idea.
1502,1502,Sometimes my asides are too clever by half.
1503,1503,Go home to Fay.
1504,1504, Eve.
1505,1505, Eve. Sorry.
1506,1506,Look at what we did.
1507,1507,We can't unring this bell.
1508,1508,We have to be vigilant.
1509,1509,In regards to?
1510,1510,"People sitting in the dark, willingly checking their disbelief at the door."
1511,1511,We have a huge responsibility.
1512,1512,I got it.
1513,1513,Got what?
1514,1514,Parkinson's.
1515,1515,"No, Shelly."
1516,1516,I'm so sorry.
1517,1517,"First, you get the tremors, and your muscles begin to fail."
1518,1518,"Pretty soon, you can't get out of a chair."
1519,1519,"Then smiling, speaking, everything goes."
1520,1520,And it keeps going tillâ¦ You could always produce.
1521,1521,"Give me the gun, Shelly."
1522,1522,"Take 'em, Mank."
1523,1523,Go on home. I'll be fine.
1524,1524,Is he with you?
1525,1525,Heâ¦ He wouldn't come.
1526,1526,Please tell me you got the gun.
1527,1527,"Oh, my God!"
1528,1528, What?
1529,1529, He had a whole box.
1530,1530,Mank.
1531,1531,You have another visitor.
1532,1532,What?
1533,1533,Drink it fast.
1534,1534,"In this heat, it'll flash to sugar."
1535,1535,"Why the wine and dine, Marion?"
1536,1536,"Good cop, bad cop?"
1537,1537," How do you mean, Mank?"
1538,1538," First Joe, now you."
1539,1539,Can't you just tell me what's on your mind?
1540,1540,"Well, I read the script."
1541,1541,Who hasn't?
1542,1542,"It's very grand, Mank, in its own way, and very much you."
1543,1543,I would've loved to play me ten years ago.
1544,1544,It was never meant to be you.
1545,1545,"For myself, I don't care, Mank."
1546,1546,"Really, I don't."
1547,1547,"But I beg you, don't kick Pops when he's down."
1548,1548,"Willie, down?"
1549,1549,"I haven't told a soul this, but I had to loan him a million dollars just to save San Simeon."
1550,1550,You hocked your jewels?
1551,1551,Of course not.
1552,1552,Just some real estate.
1553,1553,He bought me most of it anyway.
1554,1554,Willie sent you.
1555,1555,Didn't have to.
1556,1556,That surprises you?
1557,1557,You're the most observant man I know.
1558,1558, Then you deserve better.
1559,1559, That's very sweet.
1560,1560,I always wanted better.
1561,1561,Mama Rose too.
1562,1562,She made sure her daughters learned to sing and dance.
1563,1563,We were never gonna end up in Brooklyn.
1564,1564,I was only 16 when I was cast in Stop! Look! Listen!
1565,1565,That's some title.
1566,1566,Willie came to the show.
1567,1567,Same seat every night.
1568,1568,And all the other girls said to watch out.
1569,1569,He was too old for me and too interested.
1570,1570,"Come, now, he wasn't your only admirer."
1571,1571,The thing you got so right in your scriptâ¦ was how lonely he'd been as a boy.
1572,1572,"When my own mother heard he was one of the richest men in America, she said, ""Kick a little higher."" He has always been so kind to me."
1573,1573,"I love the old guy, Mank."
1574,1574,"Maybe I didn't always, back when he was my social security."
1575,1575,"But now, there are things about us togetherâ¦ that no one could possiblyâ¦ Am I persuading you at all?"
1576,1576,"I hope, if this gets made, you'll forgive me."
1577,1577,"And I hope, if it doesn't, you'll forgive me."
1578,1578,He was a modest man.
1579,1579,"His name never appeared on the marquee with the great stars, producers, and directors who worked alongside him."
1580,1580,But he loved moving pictures more than he loved anything.
1581,1581,"And he left his impeccable taste, his incredible attention to detail, on every frame he touched."
1582,1582,It is not for us to say why he was taken from us so unexpectedly.
1583,1583,"Behind, he leaves his memory."
1584,1584,"The memory of a great man, a talented man, a man of unblemished integrity."
1585,1585,Irving G. Thalberg.
1586,1586,Mank.
1587,1587,"I haven't seen you since, what was it, Jack Gilbert's funeral."
1588,1588,"Well, I haven't seen you since Shelly Metcalf's."
1589,1589,Has it been that long?
1590,1590,"How you been, Mank?"
1591,1591,Between pictures.
1592,1592,I thought you were still at MGM.
1593,1593,I am.
1594,1594,"Well, look, come see me at International."
1595,1595,Let's work something out.
1596,1596,I did come see you.
1597,1597,You gave me the same invitation after Shelly's funeral.
1598,1598,I couldn't get past your secretary's secretary.
1599,1599,Is that right?
1600,1600,"Good to see you, Mank."
1601,1601, Hello.
1602,1602, Mank?
1603,1603,"One moment, please."
1604,1604,Mank.
1605,1605,Mank!
1606,1606,It's Orson.
1607,1607, It's Orson.
1608,1608, Hmm.
1609,1609,Hello.
1610,1610,"Mank, I've just finished your first draft and I must say I'm pleased and impressed."
1611,1611, Are ya? Good news.
1612,1612," It'll need work, of course."
1613,1613,But there are no problems that can't be solved together.
1614,1614,"Well, I'm delighted to hear it."
1615,1615,Houseman's bringing my notes.
1616,1616,Think about 'em.
1617,1617,"Meantime, I'll run everything through my typewriter."
1618,1618,Everything will thank you.
1619,1619,I understand you're in touch with your Hollywood crowd?
1620,1620,"Oh, good old Houseman."
1621,1621,So perhaps you've heard.
1622,1622,None of the theater chains will touch us.
1623,1623,It looks like RKO will have to sue for restraint of trade.
1624,1624,"They'll countersue, of course."
1625,1625,"If you own that lovely home of yours, it might be a good idea to put it in Poor Sara's name."
1626,1626," You still there, Mank?"
1627,1627," Oh, yes. Where else would I be?"
1628,1628,I've saved the best for last.
1629,1629,Guess who phoned with an offer to buy out RKO's investment and shelve the picture permanently?
1630,1630, Not Hearst?
1631,1631," Mank, I'm surprised."
1632,1632,Would Othello snoop on Desdemona when he has Iago?
1633,1633,"Ah, Mayer. What did RKO say?"
1634,1634,"No dice, for now, but they're on their uppers. Whether they..."
1635,1635, You'd better drive up.
1636,1636," I plan to, just as soon as I'm done..."
1637,1637,"Today, if possible."
1638,1638,"Dear Jove, did I say something I shouldn't have?"
1639,1639,I hope you haven't lost your nerve.
1640,1640,Nerve's about all I've got left.
1641,1641,"What a year you've had, Louis."
1642,1642,How have you weathered it?
1643,1643,"Despite everything, the MGM ship, I'm happy to say, is full steam ahead."
1644,1644,We're on track with this recent slate for our most successful year ever.
1645,1645,"Well, that's great news."
1646,1646,Would you like to go lay down?
1647,1647,I think I'd rather stay upright.
1648,1648,Perhaps we can find you a costume.
1649,1649,"Well, why would I need a cosâ¦ Hello, everyone. Better late than never."
1650,1650,Mank! Where's Sara?
1651,1651,"Uh, caring for clan Mankiewicz."
1652,1652, And what train did you take?
1653,1653, Glendale. I missed my stop.
1654,1654,Got a taxi from Morro Bay.
1655,1655,"I'm confused. I thought the invitation called for circus attire, not flea circus."
1656,1656,I was cornered by a man who sold vacuum cleaners.
1657,1657,"A show of hands, who knows what a vacuum cleaner is?"
1658,1658,"Martin, would you set a place for Mr. Mankiewicz, somewhere where he might get some air?"
1659,1659,"Follow me this way, sir."
1660,1660,And offer him some coffee.
1661,1661,Yeah.
1662,1662,Mr. Monkeywitz could use some coffee.
1663,1663,And how's Marie Antoinette coming together?
1664,1664,Previews have been a struggle for general audiences.
1665,1665,"We made some trims, but I should've known."
1666,1666,"Versailles, all those costumes and wigs."
1667,1667,You can't tell those stories without overhauling them for a modern audience.
1668,1668,How's the performance of your leading lady?
1669,1669,The picture depends upon her.
1670,1670,Norma put her heart and soul into it.
1671,1671,I should've insisted she take some time.
1672,1672,"It's a lot to deal with, a loss like that."
1673,1673,Marion would've made it her own.
1674,1674, Marion would've been perfection.
1675,1675, Aw.
1676,1676,Marion Antoinette.
1677,1677, But it was Irving's picture.
1678,1678, Marionette.
1679,1679,I'm not interested in educating our customers.
1680,1680,You want to send a message?
1681,1681,Call Western Union.
1682,1682,Literary pictures.
1683,1683,"""Let them get cake."" Who needs to see that?"
1684,1684,"Joanna, come along."
1685,1685,I'll show you those horses we talked about.
1686,1686,She's very pretty.
1687,1687,"Also, very bright, bullheaded, and British."
1688,1688,"Are you here to try your luck, too, Schnutz?"
1689,1689, At what?
1690,1690, Changing my mind.
1691,1691,"I never had much success with that, Herman."
1692,1692,"In the end, you'll do what you need to."
1693,1693,"Charlie's been here, Joe's been, Marion's been."
1694,1694,"For one reason or another, all of them want me to walk away."
1695,1695,You care to hear what I've decided?
1696,1696,Not really.
1697,1697,"After 20 years of connubial bliss, blind loyalty can get a little suffocating."
1698,1698,Okay. Here goes.
1699,1699,God knows I've rehearsed it enough.
1700,1700,I've raised your kids kosher and all but by myself.
1701,1701,"I've put up with your suicidal drinking, your compulsive gambling, your silly platonic affairs."
1702,1702,"You owe me, Herman."
1703,1703,"So Joe says he can't promise, but he thinks if you make nice with Mayer, you can have your old job back."
1704,1704,Is that what you want me to say?
1705,1705,"I know what your answer'll be, so don't ask me to give you Poor Sara's seal of approval."
1706,1706,"Why do you put up with me, Schnutz?"
1707,1707,My movie star looks or my diplomat's charm?
1708,1708,"I suppose because being married to you, Herman, I'm never bored."
1709,1709,"Exhausted, yes. Exasperated, usually."
1710,1710,"But having devoted so much, I have to stick around to see how it all turns out."
1711,1711,"And whatever you decide, please be mindful of those who care about you most."
1712,1712,I'm going riding.
1713,1713,Haven't seen a horse's face in years.
1714,1714,"Oh, and one last thing, Herman."
1715,1715,I don't want nobody calling me Poor Sara no more.
1716,1716,"I've got a great idea for a picture, Louis."
1717,1717,A picture I just know you're gonna love.
1718,1718,It's a modernday version of Quixote.
1719,1719,"Now, I know none of you read, but you know what it's about."
1720,1720,A deluded old nobleman who tilts at windmills.
1721,1721,So how might we update this story?
1722,1722, Do you want me to get...
1723,1723," No, no."
1724,1724,How about we make our Quixoteâ¦ a newspaperman?
1725,1725,Who else could make a living tilting at windmills?
1726,1726,But that's not enough.
1727,1727,"No, he wants more than readership."
1728,1728,He wants more than adulation.
1729,1729,He wants love.
1730,1730,"So, he runs for public office, and because he's notably rich, he wins."
1731,1731,"No, wait, wait a minute."
1732,1732,Notably rich and powerful can't win over an audience unless notably rich and powerful sees the error of his ways in the final reel.
1733,1733,Notably rich and powerful and making no goddamn excuses for it is only admirable in real life.
1734,1734,"Isn't that right, Louis?"
1735,1735,So what do we do?
1736,1736,Anybody?
1737,1737,We give him ideals.
1738,1738,"Ideals that any dirtpoor, depressionweary audience can identify with."
1739,1739,Our Quixote is against crooked trusts.
1740,1740,"He's for the eighthour workday, fair income tax, better schools."
1741,1741,"Why, he's even for government ownership of railroads."
1742,1742,You know what we call those people?
1743,1743, Communists?
1744,1744, Anarchists?
1745,1745,"No, our Quixote, he's a twofisted muckraker."
1746,1746,"In fact, someone predicts that he will one day win the presidency and bring about, get thisâ¦ â¦a socialist revolution."
1747,1747, What a bunch of bullshit!
1748,1748, Is it?
1749,1749,"Tell him, Willie."
1750,1750,Tell him.
1751,1751,Upton Sinclair used exactly those words to describe a young William Randolph Hearst.
1752,1752, You miserable bastard!
1753,1753, How do you do?
1754,1754,"Our Quixote, he hungers, he thirsts, he lusts for voters to love him."
1755,1755,Love him enough to make him president.
1756,1756,"But they won't, and they don't."
1757,1757,How do you suppose that could happen?
1758,1758,"Could it be because, in their hearts, they know that he values power over people?"
1759,1759,"Disillusioned in Congress, he authors not one single piece of legislation in two terms."
1760,1760,Can you believe that?
1761,1761,That'll take some writing.
1762,1762,"Placed in nomination for president, but it's too radical for the boys in the back."
1763,1763,"His bid goes nowhere, but we're doing something."
1764,1764,We're building sympathy.
1765,1765,"Rejected, he flees to lotusland, where his faithful troll, Sancho, has prepared a mythical kingdom forâ¦ Wait a minute."
1766,1766,I forgot the love interest.
1767,1767,Her nameâ¦ Dulcinea.
1768,1768,"Funny, adventurous, smarter than she acts."
1769,1769,"Ah, she's aâ¦ she's a showgirl, beneath his social stratum, but that's okay, because true love on the big screens, we all know, is blind."
1770,1770,"And sheâ¦ Yeah, she loves him too."
1771,1771,So he takes her away to his mythical kingdom.
1772,1772,Can I get a bicarb?
1773,1773,"Now, along comes nemesis."
1774,1774,That's Greek for any guy in a black hat.
1775,1775,Nemesis runs for governor and he's a shooin to win.
1776,1776,Why? Because he's exactly what our Don used to be.
1777,1777,"An idealist, you get it?"
1778,1778,"And not only that, nemesis is the same guy who once predicted our Quixote would one day preside over a socialist revolution."
1779,1779,"Our Quixote looks into the mirror of his youth and decides to break this glass, a maddening reminder of who he once was."
1780,1780,"Assisted by his faithful Sancho, and armed with all the black magic at his command, he does just this."
1781,1781,Destroying in the process not one manâ¦ but two.
1782,1782,"Well, what do you think, Louis?"
1783,1783,Hmm?
1784,1784,You think it'll play?
1785,1785,"Don't worry, folks."
1786,1786,"Uh, the white wine came up with the fish."
1787,1787,"Who the fuck do you think you are, Mankiewicz?"
1788,1788,You're nothin' but a court jester.
1789,1789,And let me let you in on a little secret.
1790,1790,Do you have any idea who pays half your salary?
1791,1791,He pays half your fucking salary.
1792,1792,"Him, you fucking ingrate."
1793,1793,"You didn't know that, did ya?"
1794,1794,You wanna know why?
1795,1795,Because he likes the way you talk.
1796,1796,"Not the way you write, the way you talk."
1797,1797,Don't that chap your ass?
1798,1798," Please, follow me."
1799,1799, It's very quaint.
1800,1800,"Rise and shine, hombre."
1801,1801,Shootout at the O.K. Corral.
1802,1802,"Before we buckle down, I gather you have something to get off your chest?"
1803,1803,"As a matter of fact, I do."
1804,1804,"Frankly, I think what I said upset you."
1805,1805,I know your health's not what it might be.
1806,1806,I understand that comes first.
1807,1807, Really?
1808,1808," This studio fuss, this lawsuit."
1809,1809,God only knows what pressure's yet to come.
1810,1810,"At your age, you'd be justified in wanting out."
1811,1811,"I'm 43, but that's very understanding."
1812,1812,Mayer's buyout was rejected.
1813,1813,"So, the fat's only starting to hit the fire."
1814,1814,"Now, I talked to RKO, and I'll tell you what they're ready to do."
1815,1815,"In recognition of the outstanding work you've done so far, they're prepared to relieve you of the rewrite and still honor your full pay, plus $10,000."
1816,1816,How's that?
1817,1817,That's more than generous.
1818,1818,But I don't intend to walk.
1819,1819,All right.
1820,1820,"What's bothering you, then?"
1821,1821,"You're not going to like this, Orson."
1822,1822,I want credit.
1823,1823,Come again?
1824,1824,It's the best thing I've ever written.
1825,1825,"Jack, get me some Cuban cigars."
1826,1826, In Victorville?
1827,1827," Do what you can, Jack."
1828,1828,"Oh, stay, Houseman."
1829,1829,You'll miss the third act complicator.
1830,1830,"Get going, Jack. Muy pronto."
1831,1831,I believe that means right away.
1832,1832,"Mank, Mank."
1833,1833,"What I said was more in sorrow than in anger, Willie."
1834,1834,Are you familiar with the parable of the organ grinder's monkey?
1835,1835,"Now, the organ grinder's monkey is tiny in stature, and having been taken from the wild, he's naturally overwhelmed by the enormous world around him."
1836,1836,"But every morning, a sweet elderly woman dresses him in a fine suit of clothes."
1837,1837,She fits him with a red velvet vest adorned with pearl buttons and a handsome red fez with a silk tassel.
1838,1838,"She slips on brocade shoes that curl at the toe, and he's paired with a fine gilt music box on an exquisite gold chain fastened to his neck and his neck alone."
1839,1839,"Whenever he ventures into the city to perform, he thinks, ""What a powerful fellow I must be."" ""Look how patiently everyone waits just to watch me dance."" Hey, Willie..."
1840,1840,"""And wherever I go,"" he thinks, ""this music box must follow, and with it, this poor downtrodden man."" ""And if I chose not to dance, this sorry street peddler would starve, and every time I do decide to dance, every timeâ¦ he must play."" ""Whether he wishes to or not."" You've had a bit too much to drink, Herman."
1841,1841,I'll get Raymond to drive you to the station.
1842,1842,Goodbye.
1843,1843,"Put aside gratitude, Mank."
1844,1844,That you've done your best work was no accident.
1845,1845,"I removed any distraction, eliminated every excuse, your family, your cronies, liquor."
1846,1846,I gave you a second chance.
1847,1847,"And for that, I cannot thank you enough."
1848,1848,But with credit for a risky undertaking must go the weight of real responsibility.
1849,1849,"Given your current health, I wonder if you're up to it."
1850,1850,"Frankly, I wonder, too, but we'll find out."
1851,1851,"You may never work in this town again, Mank!"
1852,1852,"Orson, pleaseâ¦ Then you force me to remind you!"
1853,1853,We have a contract that you understood and agreed to!
1854,1854,"If you fight this, it will go to what your new guild calls arbitration, and you, my friend, will lose script, money, and assuming such a thing still exists in Hollywood, the respect of those who honor their word."
1855,1855,How can I put this nicely?
1856,1856,"I may be a loose cannon, but you, my friend, are an outsider."
1857,1857,"They're exasperated by me, and I've earned it, but you, a selfanointed saviorhyphenate, they're just waiting to loathe you."
1858,1858,Remind me never again to work with a washedup alcoholic!
1859,1859,"Duly noted. Nelson Algren, please copy."
1860,1860,All right!
1861,1861,No doubt you'll get your credit.
1862,1862,"But ask yourself, ""Who's producing this picture?"" ""Directing it? Starring in it?"" That's just what we need when Susan leaves Kane."
1863,1863,An act of purging violence.
1864,1864,Maybe.
1865,1865,"Mank! Mank, where are you?"
1866,1866,"Mank, come quick!"
1867,1867,He's alive!
1868,1868,Ian's alive!
1869,1869, He fetched up on the Orkneys!
1870,1870, The what?
1871,1871,"The Orkney Islands, you idiot."
1872,1872,"Oh, Mank, are you ever serious?"
1873,1873,Only about something funny.
1874,1874,And the winner of the best original screenplay isâ¦ Herman J. Mankiewiczâ¦ â¦and Orson Welles for Citizen Kane.
1875,1875,This is the first nomination and first win for Mr. Mankiewicz and Mr. Welles.
1876,1876,Neither were able to attend tonight.
1877,1877,"Accepting for both is the president of RKO Radio Pictures, Mr. George Schaefer."
1878,1878," Excuse me, Mr. Welles."
1879,1879, Good morning.
1880,1880,"Good morning, Mr. Welles."
1881,1881,You missed a big night.
1882,1882,I was unable to attend the Academy Awards because I'm here in Rio making a marvelous motion picture.
1883,1883,"Kane was nominated in nine categories, including best actor."
1884,1884,Aren't you disappointed that it only won one Oscar?
1885,1885,"Well, that, my good man, is Hollywood."
1886,1886,"Anything you'd like to say to your coauthor, Mr. Mankiewicz?"
1887,1887,I do have a message.
1888,1888,"You may tell him from meâ¦ Mank, you can kiss my half!"
1889,1889,You ask me what my acceptance speech might have been.
1890,1890,"Well, here goes."
1891,1891,"I am very happy to accept this award in the manner in which the screenplay was written, which is to say, in the absence of Orson Welles."
1892,1892, How's that?
1893,1893, How come he shares credit?
1894,1894,"Well, that, my friend, is the magic of the movies."
1895,1895,"Hold up the Oscar, Mank."
1896,1896,Big smile.
