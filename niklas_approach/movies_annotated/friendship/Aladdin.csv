249,249," When Aladin will come to free me, you will pay dearly."
250,250, To free you from what?
251,251,You are not my prisoner.
252,252, Oh?
253,253," Detach the princess, Strange band! Oh !"

265,265,Are you talking about that one?
266,266,Maybe you're talking about that one?
267,267, No !
268,268, Or that one?
269,269,Maybe you thought of him ...
270,270,"After, you thought of him, Then, you thought of him."
271,271,"But the truth, it's because you thought of him."
272,272, No ! No !
273,273,Its good. Not him.
274,274,Okay.
275,275,"For the wedding date, I was thinking of the 7th."
276,276,It is...
277,277,"It's an even number, the 7th."
278,278,"For food, it's my mom."
279,279,"For music, it's me."
280,280,"âª love to sing! Hey, Wahid?"

294,294, That's what we are going to see.

296,296,What is that ?
297,297,"Finally, almost nothing."
298,298,It's not true ?

315,315,"Shah Zaman, how are you going to choose people to torture?"
316,316, Simply to the splash.
317,317, What's the splash?
318,318," Splash, splash, it'll be you that I will torture."
319,319, Huh? Me ?
320,320,It's an example.
321,321,I will not do it.
322,322, AH!
323,323, Yes you ?

340,340," That's where I'll end my life,  as </ i> other guys finished it."
341,341, I have a lot of admiration for you.
342,342, How nice.
343,343, It is true. The number of people that you made suffer ...
344,344, I did not count.
345,345,We know each other ?
346,346,We would not have crossed at the Salon de la Torture?
347,347, I go there every year.
348,348, That's it.
349,349, The number of bullshit I bought!
350,350, We go without wanting anything and we come back ...
351,351," Like me, I have a room filled with bullshit."
352,352,I do not know what to do with it!
353,353, the eyebrow peel.
354,354, I have all the colors.

358,358, I never saw it in red.
359,359, There is only one.
360,360, A unique model.
361,361," I do not know, but there is only one."
362,362, I guess we're not here to talk about rags?
363,363," No, I took a stand from the city of Baghdad."
364,364, Oh yeah ?
365,365, And I want to marry the princess.
366,366,So I torture the people.
367,367,Classic.
368,368,But there is something that I do not understand.
369,369,"I torture, I torture, they do not care."
370,370,It never happened to me!
371,371," I know, it comes from me."
372,372,I tortured them so much that they are immune.
373,373, Are they carpenters?
374,374, What have you done  like </ i> school of dictatorship?
375,375, I did not go to school.
376,376,I am an autolib '.
377,377, An autodidact.
378,378,"  No, a car ""b"". </ i>  No, we say selftaught."
379,379, The difference ?
380,380," An autolib ', it's an electric car."
381,381,An autodidact was done alone.
382,382, We quibble.
383,383,"My concern, is that I want the princess agree to marry me."
384,384, Beware of her.
385,385,It's a vicious one.
386,386, I was sure of it.
387,387," Me, like you, I tried to marry him."
388,388,You know what she pretended?
389,389,That I had bad breath.
390,390,Me !

395,395, No.
396,396, It's unbearable.
397,397," Wait. As you know, I was sentenced to 1400 years in prison."
398,398,So I appealed and I took over 500 years.
399,399,It makes me 1400 plus 500.
400,400,1200?
401,401," No, 1400 plus 500."
402,402,4X4  9 ...

443,443, Cursed vizier!
444,444, It's not him.
445,445, Ah?
446,446," If I get you out of there, will you become my genius again?"
447,447," My brother, you've always been a cousin for me."
448,448,"But it's over for me, the genies."
449,449,"Since I knew the pleasures of the human, I love!"
450,450,Even if it's not me ...
451,451, I understand. Good luck.
452,452,It was a pleasure to see you again.
453,453,Kiss!
454,454," Ciao, cousin, wait!"
455,455,Hold on !
456,456,Do not leave me.
457,457,"I'll be your genius, if you want, for 2, 3 weeks."
458,458,But extract me from here.
459,459, Silence!
460,460,Go!
461,461,That we run this scum.
462,462, No !
463,463, Cut off his head!
464,464, Wait!
465,465,"Whatever his crime, he deserves to be judged and defended according to the laws."
466,466, What are you bitching for?
467,467,Are you a sworn defender?
468,468," I am Aladdin, Prince of Baghdad."
469,469, Tatata!
470,470," By my title, I have the right to defend whoever seems to me."
471,471, Tatata.
472,472, Can you prove that you are Prince Aladdin?
473,473, I left a little fast from the palace.
474,474,I forgot my papers.
475,475, You're not serious ?
476,476, Do you still have your ID?
477,477," Permanently, brother!"
478,478, Silence!
479,479,Can anyone stand as guarantor of his identity?
480,480," CarrÃ©ment, me. Yes."
481,481, Other than him.
482,482," Guys, Aladin!"
483,483,"The magic lamp, the genius ..."
484,484,I dilapidated the vizier 2 years ago.
485,485, Very well.
486,486,We lost  enough time.
487,487,"Execute it, this pervert!"
488,488,No no !
489,489,"  Yalla, yalla </ i>  What is it?"
490,490,The arrival of Aladdin </ i>  It's me!
491,491,"Yelle, yalla, but what? </ I>  Too good, too good </ i> Everybody !"
492,492," Hey! </ I>  Hey, Aladdin! </ i> Do not hear?"

494,494,"Din, yeah."
495,495, They are not in delirium.
496,496," Forcibly, a cappella, it's hard."
497,497, It was good.
498,498,"A little embarrassing, but good."
499,499," Is it you, Aladdin?"
500,500, Yeah. Yes it's me.
501,501,"Personally, I'm not a fan."
502,502, Ah.
503,503, But my daughter is listening to you in a loop.
504,504, No ?
505,505, Yes !
506,506, Can we take a selfie?
507,507,For my daughter.
508,508, Of course.
509,509, Shah Zaman ...
510,510,I thought a lot.
511,511,And I thought ...
512,512,Aladin fled and I need a prince to rule Baghdad.
513,513,I will reconsider with great interest your proposal.
514,514, It is true ?
515,515, I seem to lie?
516,516, It's nice.
517,517, Let's drink.
518,518, I did not expect that.
519,519,Toast.
520,520, Beware of the princess.
521,521,It's a little vicious.
522,522," Even there, he stinks of the jaws."
523,523, Sorry ?
524,524, No nothing.
525,525,Toast.

541,541,"We will do that, look..."
542,542,"That's it, it's the same two."
543,543,Choose which one you want.
544,544, You permit ?
545,545,Keep !
546,546,Would not you be thirsty?
547,547," No, I'm not thirsty."
548,548," Yes, you're thirsty."
549,549,We are deserting.
550,550,We are deserting.
551,551,Here !
552,552,Side effects?
553,553,Vision problems?

567,567, Reassured?
568,568,"We will have to work on this paranoid side, it's not sexy."
569,569," My friends, let's summarize the situation."
570,570,You accuse my client here to have seduced and made pregnant these 20 ...
571,571,or even 40 poor girls.
572,572,But did you see his mouth?
573,573,He is so ugly that the hunchback of NotreDame call him dad.
574,574,"The day of his birth, at the clinic, they gave it to his mother with a vomit bag!"
575,575, Do not attack the mothers.
576,576," Wait, I'm going on."
577,577, He's whew!
578,578,My client is so naughty ...
579,579,they understood.
580,580," The mask with its mouth on Halloween, it's the best sale of the year!"
581,581, I think it's good.
582,582," In view of the new elements, we declare the accused innocent How could he seduce our most beautiful women with a mouth like that?"
583,583," Calm down. That my sis carries me, no problem."
584,584,He is naughty too. But you ?
585,585,I will tell you the truth.
586,586,I have them all boiled.
587,587, Comeâ¦  No no no !
588,588,I made them all pregnant.

599,599,It was right.

601,601, What are we doing here?
602,602, Do not worry. A genius must have his lamp.
603,603,Must recover it.
604,604,I have a plan. Relax.
605,605,"Do not worry, here it's home."
606,606, That is why ?

613,613,We are two.
614,614,"Aladin, sorry, frankly ..."
615,615, Are you Aladdin?
616,616, Yeah.
617,617," Yeah. If, yeah."
618,618, Are you really Aladdin?
619,619,The one we are talking about? The Aladin?
620,620, Well yes.
621,621,"Yeah, it's me."
622,622,"You can call me Aladin, ""The Aladdin"", that makes me the fart."
623,623, The Aladdin who stuck a flute in the ass?
624,624, Sorry ? No.
625,625, Yesâ¦  Who told you that ?
626,626," Dude, you're a real legend."
627,627,Nobody had done it before.

629,629,Must put things back in context.
630,630, A pioneer of the flute in the 'uc!
631,631," Come on, come home."
632,632," After, guys have put saxophones, but the flute, he invented it, the guy."
633,633," *  Genius 27 is expected in his lamp. </ i>  Guys, look who's here."
634,634,Aladin himself.
635,635,"Aladdin, Aladdin ..."
636,636," No, it's not necessary."
637,637, ALADIN! ALADIN! ALADIN!
638,638," Flute in the ass, flute in the ass!"
639,639, What?
640,640, Oh oh ! No no !
641,641,What are you doing ?
642,642, Guys !
643,643,We came to get a lamp for me to recover my powers to help my friend.
644,644, You have nothing to do here!
645,645,Bouge.
646,646,You betrayed us by becoming again human.
647,647,You're the shame of geniuses.
648,648, The shame of geniuses?
649,649,"Drop it, it's the chef."
650,650,I had a story with his sister ...
651,651,As well as his brother and an uncle ...
652,652,"Come on, we'll break."
653,653, No wait.

656,656, I need a lamp.
657,657,To deliver my princess who is in Baghdad.
658,658,"Without him, genius, I will not succeed."
659,659, I do not give a damn.
660,660," Excuse me, chief of geniuses."
661,661,"In reality, I have the right to a challenge."
662,662, Do you want a challenge?
663,663, Oh yes !
664,664, Challenge!
665,665,"If you catch her, she's yours."
666,666," Easy, that!"
667,667," If you fail, you will stay here and you will become our servants until the end of time."
668,668, Where do not I get it?
669,669,"He is whew, the keum!"
670,670, You have 30 seconds.
671,671,"Give me three, brother."
672,672,No problem.
673,673, Oh yeah.
674,674, He left.
675,675, No. First floor.
676,676, Wow!
677,677," Hello, baby."
678,678,Are we breaking?
679,679, No. We try.

730,730, And that mouth?
731,731,Who is this pretty mouth?
732,732, It's mine...
733,733, And these nÃ©nÃ©s?
734,734, What?
735,735, Where are they ?
736,736, Oh !
737,737,Aladinde?
738,738, You sent me to the bed crazy!
739,739,I need to go with you.
740,740," I'm sorry, how are you?"
741,741,Do you have to yell?
742,742,"I'm yelling at you, me?"
743,743, Aladinde?
744,744,I know you're here!
745,745,I got you!

776,776,I saw it  as </ i> I see you.
777,777,He was there.
778,778," Are we sleeping with you, boss?"

796,796, I have a genius who is completely kidding.
797,797, Did you try to turn it back on?
798,798," Yes I did. Off, on again."
799,799, I will try a remote reboot.
800,800,It takes a few minutes.
801,801,It is under warranty?
802,802, I dunno.
803,803,I had released him.
804,804,"There, I reneed him."
805,805," *  If you slammed it off, </ i> to relamp it, must reconnect it to the network."
806,806,You need a code.
807,807,Do you have something to note?
808,808, * The code: JGSDGYFD85YH  </ i> AD98Kl87OKLM28QW.
809,809,You noted?
810,810," Sorry, I do not have anything to notice."
811,811,Can you repeat ?
812,812," The first letter, it's J  like </ i> Janus."
813,813,"The 2nd, G  as </ i> GalafÃ©."
814,814, Yeah.
815,815,"3e,  8 </ i> as Sifilmax."
816,816," Excuse me, what are these names?"
817,817,Who is Janus?
818,818, He was there.
819,819,I see Aladinde everywhere.
820,820,He comes to my house without an appointment.
821,821, You just see Aladin or you see others ...
822,822,Other men?
823,823, Men ?
824,824,How are men?
825,825, You tell me that you see Aladin all over. That's it ?
826,826, Yes.
827,827,"Even if I admit, doctor, that sometimes, I have a dream where I dress with my mom's clothes and I go in ..."
828,828,"In a karaoke cabaret which is called ""L'aguicheur""."
829,829,"And there, I sing."
830,830," Ziggy </ i>  My name is Ziggy </ i>  He has no friend </ i>  He's a boy like no other </ i>  He's nice, it's not his fault </ i>  Already, you have a beautiful voice."
831,831,Looks like an angel.
832,832, It is true ?
833,833, Yes.
834,834, You too have a nice voice.
835,835, Oh no...
836,836, And ...
837,837,a pretty beard.
838,838,Yes.
839,839," So, uh ..."
840,840, Doctor.
841,841,I'm scared.
842,842,It's serious ?
843,843, What? Oh no !
844,844,"No, it's simple. If you see everywhere Aladin who appears and disappears, it seems obvious to me he recovered his lamp and his genius."
845,845, But it exists?
846,846, Ah yes.
847,847, A magic lamp?
848,848,It is true ?
849,849, I confirm it.
850,850, You are strong.
851,851,"Me too, I want a lamp."
852,852, It seems that we can find some at the black market.
853,853,"Intriguing music  In the mazes, everyone can write their story."
854,854, Spices.
855,855, The big curse ...
856,856,Potions.
857,857, Grimoires.
858,858, WELCOME TO THE BLACK MARKET.
859,859, Kill them.
860,860," After, I kill you both."
861,861,Even Michel Blanc is black.
862,862, Everything is black at the black market!
863,863,"Welcome to my humble shop Act, black market, everyone makes his story."
864,864,"Colanders, squids ..."
865,865,"Shah Zaman, hello."
866,866, I want a magic lamp.
867,867, Monsieur is a connoisseur.
868,868,I have something for you.
869,869,"So, that's my swimsuit."
870,870,That's my soccer shoes.
871,871,âª arrive.
872,872,here this magnificent lamp.
873,873,This is an opportunity like there is not one.
874,874,It is still under warranty.
875,875, She is small.
876,876, Little but strong !
877,877,"As it is the last, I make a friend price."
878,878,It's given.
879,879,A piece ?
880,880,Gift ! I make a gift!
881,881," No, it bothers me."
882,882, We must not be embarrassed. Gift !
883,883, It's a lot.
884,884, I'll add that to you.
885,885,"Tipex, to erase bad memories."
886,886, I can not accept.
887,887, It is necessary !
888,888,With the heart.
889,889, It is true ?
890,890,It's not because you're scared that I kill you?
891,891," No, I'm not scared!"
892,892,I am not afraid at all!
893,893," Then, I accept!"
894,894,Tell me...
895,895,How it works ?
896,896, It must be polished gently with the thumb.
897,897, I polish him ...
898,898,I polish it ...

903,903," I bow down to you, big Shah Zaman."
904,904, No it is not me.
905,905, Who is it?
906,906, It's him.
907,907,"  That, </ i> he's a genius?"
908,908, Yes Boss.
909,909," It made me feel good, this reboot."
910,910,âª should have done it sooner.
911,911, Yeah ...
912,912,So here we are in Baghdad?
913,913,They changed the decor.
914,914, Yes. And the temperature.
915,915, What are you doing at home?
916,916, We did not know it was your home.
917,917,You are ?
918,918, Snow Queen.
919,919, Sorry.
920,920,"Snow Queen, we know it."
921,921,She is called the queen of ...
922,922, Shut up !
923,923," Oh, stop!"
924,924,"Madam, do not do that."
925,925, Who allowed you to enter in my forbidden palace?
926,926, We did not know it was forbidden.
927,927,"We go to Baghdad to free, finally, deliver ..."
928,928," Wait, what did you say?"
929,929," We're going to Baghdad to free, finally, deliver ..."
930,930," To release, to deliver ..."
931,931,"It's very good, that."
932,932,Very very good.
933,933,I'm having trouble on a song ...
934,934,"So, can I borrow it?"
935,935, Yeah.
936,936," Great, thank you."
937,937, Release ... </ i> No...
938,938, Issue ... </ i> No.
939,939, Mrs. Snow?
940,940, Yes ?
941,941, And for my friend?
942,942, I can not do anything for you.
943,943,It must be founded.
944,944," Free! </ i>  Deliver! </ i>  Sorry, we do not have time."
945,945,She continues to sing.
946,946, No no no !
947,947, Its good.
948,948,What happened to you ?
949,949, Can I submit you amber musks?
950,950, I love the amber muse!
951,951, Ah! There you are !
952,952," Master, if you knew how it's done good to find my legs."
953,953,Thank you.
954,954, I want my wishes.
955,955,"I want that when Aladinde returns to Baghdad, you kill him."
956,956," Oh yeah, no."
957,957,Sorry I can not do that.
958,958,I can not kill a human as a genius.
959,959,I am only love.
960,960,I am only kisses.
961,961,I want...
962,962,that Princess Shallia love me illico pesto.
963,963," That too, I can not do it."
964,964,A genius can not make lovers.
965,965," If you do not arrive to fulfill my wishes, it's because you have no powers."
966,966,That's all.
967,967, I have no powers?
968,968,"Me, I have no powers?"
969,969,"Master, you are wrong."
970,970, Akinator?
971,971," You, you are wrong."
972,972, I am wrong?
973,973,Look at this.
974,974,Think very hard in your head to a famous person.
975,975, That's it.
976,976, Is it a man?
977,977, Yes.
978,978, Is he an actor?
979,979, Yes.
980,980, Is he bald?
981,981, Yes. Yes.
982,982,Rihanna.
983,983, Unbelievable.
984,984, It works !
985,985,It's incredible !
986,986,It's incredible. Rihanna...
987,987, Nothing to fuck of that!
988,988,You see that ?
989,989, Noâ¦  Do you want to go back?
990,990, No I do not want to.
991,991, That's it ?
992,992, I do not want to go back.
993,993,"I can not force a woman to fall in love, but I can help you seduce her."
994,994, That is to say ?
995,995, You know that I am an expert in seduction.
996,996, It is true ?
997,997, Yes.
998,998,Well ... I know what to do.
999,999,Jealousy.
1000,1000,"Jealousy, master!"
1001,1001,Just make it jealous Princess.
1002,1002,She should see you with another woman.
1003,1003,How do you think I look ?
1004,1004, Your voice ?
1005,1005," Ba, be, bi, bo, bu ..."
1006,1006,Question of settings.
1007,1007,"Ba, ba, ba ..."
1008,1008,I got it !
1009,1009,And there?
1010,1010,How do you think I look ?
1011,1011, It goes.
1012,1012,"It's not crazy, but it goes."
1013,1013, Hey !
1014,1014,Welcome to Baghdad.
1015,1015,Here we are.
1016,1016,Near center.
1017,1017,It feels good to be back.
1018,1018, It's Baghdad?
1019,1019," Yes, I ... Yes."
1020,1020,What? Do you judge on the physical?
1021,1021,"They have a particular color, so they have no right to be bagdadis?"
1022,1022, Hey !
1023,1023, Who is he ?
1024,1024, Welcome.
1025,1025, Hey !
1026,1026, Are you staying dinner?
1027,1027,Soup of goat gut.
1028,1028,"It's very strong, but very nice."
1029,1029, I had dinner already.
1030,1030,"""Yes, I said no."
1031,1031," You said no, I had dinner ..."
1032,1032, We'll move.
1033,1033," Put your legs, they look at us chelous."
1034,1034, See you.
1035,1035, Hi.
1036,1036, I hope that it will work.
1037,1037, Trust me.
1038,1038, You'd better. She's there !
1039,1039, You wanted to see me ?
1040,1040," Oh, princess!"
1041,1041, Who is this?
1042,1042, A friend who comes from the Yvelines to see me.
1043,1043,"Princess, I summoned you to inform you that I'm organizing a charity ball."
1044,1044,"As my company dislikes you, I will go with my friend."
1045,1045, Ok good. That's all ?
1046,1046, That's all.
1047,1047,Oh!
1048,1048,What did she say?
1049,1049, No nothing. Nonsense.
1050,1050,You're funny.
1051,1051," Otherwise, I said to myself, about the ball ..."
1052,1052,It might be better to go with a princess rather than with a girl say ... ordinary.
1053,1053,"Let's say I did not think about it, that's right."
1054,1054,After all why not ?
1055,1055, Wait.
1056,1056,I did not understand.
1057,1057,Who is ordinary?
1058,1058, Sorry.
1059,1059,I meant rather vulgar.
1060,1060, What did you say ? I'm going to fuck you.
1061,1061, No !
1062,1062,Nobody talks to me like that.
1063,1063," Girls, girls, girls ..."
1064,1064," Did you hear it, Pocahontas?"
1065,1065,She says I'm vulgar.
1066,1066, But you're not vulgar.
1067,1067,"You are beautiful, you are distinguished, you are divine."
1068,1068, Do you take his defense?
1069,1069, Noâ¦  You have found yourself well.
1070,1070,Your mediocrity inspires me a picture.
1071,1071,Have fun at your party!
1072,1072,Princess!
1073,1073," Go ahead, let her go, we do not care."
1074,1074, Are you a jerk or what?
1075,1075, Why ?
1076,1076, What did we say?
1077,1077,Put your head back.
1078,1078, Why do you say that ?
1079,1079,What did we say?
1080,1080, I saw you with the other!
1081,1081,You looked at me even more!
1082,1082,What am I to you ? A kleenex we use and throw?
1083,1083,You're wrong girl!
1084,1084,I'm not that one.
1085,1085,You know who I am ? A gogetter!
1086,1086,I am a girl who advances in life.
1087,1087,A girl who does not control her emotions.
1088,1088,I am a fighter.
1089,1089,A womanfruit. A celibattante.
1090,1090, A bachelor?
1091,1091, Yes that's it.
1092,1092, With your beard? Huh?
1093,1093,A single person?
1094,1094," Oh, master!"
1095,1095,I got excited. Sorry.
1096,1096, How do I do ?
1097,1097,"The lady is gone, now!"
1098,1098,You will go back to your lamp.
1099,1099, No !
1100,1100,I have an idea.
1101,1101,A great idea.
1102,1102, You're a brilliant genius.
1103,1103, You are a master ... 90.
1104,1104," Meanwhile, Aladdin and his genius were struggling to return to Baghdad."
1105,1105,Thrilling music  I discovered America!
1106,1106, Who's this guy?
1107,1107,What are they doing here?
1108,1108, We just pass.
1109,1109," Oh, no scrambles!"
1110,1110,You will not say that you have discovered America.
1111,1111,"I, Christopher Columbus, I discovered it."
1112,1112, Of course.
1113,1113,You have discovered America.
1114,1114," It's you, though technically, we were there before."
1115,1115, Shut up.
1116,1116, What?
1117,1117, Technically ...
1118,1118, There's no.
1119,1119," What, technically?"
1120,1120, There is nothing.
1121,1121,You have discovered America.
1122,1122,You enter history.
1123,1123,It's amazing.
1124,1124, We agree.
1125,1125,"I, Christopher Columbus, I discovered America."
1126,1126, Although technically ...
1127,1127,"Intriguing music  Ah, good evening, princess."
1128,1128,You are welcome.
1129,1129, What do you want now ?
1130,1130, Just a little dinner.
1131,1131,To make me forgive the inconvenience with my friend.
1132,1132,"I admit, she was vulgar."
1133,1133," Even if physically, it goes."
1134,1134,She was rude.
1135,1135,Sorry about that.
1136,1136,"Come on, be not shy."
1137,1137,Follow me.
1138,1138, I am not shy.
1139,1139,You intend to impress me with your eve meal and ...
1140,1140,Is it me or are there two moons?
1141,1141, I have a little redecorated.
1142,1142,I hope you like it.
1143,1143, It's flashy.
1144,1144, Princess ...
1145,1145,Let's give up our intestinal quarrels.
1146,1146,And let's take advantage of this magnificent starry night.
1147,1147,Look.
1148,1148,It's the Big Dipper.
1149,1149,"Beside her, the Average Curse, her cousin."
1150,1150,And there ...
1151,1151,A polar bear.
1152,1152,I do not know what he's doing there.
1153,1153, Great.
1154,1154,Princess.
1155,1155,This night is placed under the sign of ...
1156,1156, That's done.
1157,1157," Bravo, princess!"
1158,1158,You have just thrown away by the balcony an innocent lookalike.
1159,1159, No!
1160,1160, But if.
1161,1161,It's not I did not trust you.
1162,1162,But after the poisoned glass ...
1163,1163,I made arrangements.
1164,1164,I hired a lookalike who did not look much like me  What do you mean ? It was the same!
1165,1165," No ! No, sorry."
1166,1166,"Already, it's not quite the same mustache."
1167,1167,And the nose!
1168,1168, That's done.
1169,1169,Again.
1170,1170," Bravo, princess!"
1171,1171, No!
1172,1172,You have just thrown an innocent lookalike over the balcony.
1173,1173, But no !
1174,1174, Yes.
1175,1175, This is cheating !
1176,1176, Oh !
1177,1177,I am Shah Zaman or a lookalike?
1178,1178," Guess, guess, guess, who I am </ i>  Behind Mouloud, I do what I like ... </ i> Suspenseful music  That's it !"
1179,1179,Ah! I killed Shah Zaman! Yes!
1180,1180, No!
1181,1181, That's not nice!
1182,1182, That's not nice !
1183,1183,You throw people like this to shootlarigot ...
1184,1184, It's not true ! Is it you or not?
1185,1185, It's not you !
1186,1186,Stopped !
1187,1187,Oh dear!
1188,1188,Princess!
1189,1189,"Know that from today, I will execute 100 Baghdadas a day."
1190,1190,As long as we are not married.
1191,1191,I do not care.
1192,1192, I hate you !
1193,1193," I too, hate you!"
1194,1194,Lookalikes ...
1195,1195,Ah!
1196,1196,"So, how was I?"
1197,1197,"Excellent. The truth, excellent."
1198,1198, I admit it was easy.
1199,1199,"It's enough to be small, mean, vicious, viscous, and it works."
1200,1200," It's your mother, the viscous, yes!"
1201,1201, Well then...
1202,1202,"It's Baghdad, that's it."
1203,1203, You're right.
1204,1204, Yeah. That's what you asked.
1205,1205," Finally, I asked that a moment ago."
1206,1206, Aladin is here!
1207,1207,"Quick, catch it!"
1208,1208,"Thrilling music  OK, what do we do?"
1209,1209, You trust me ?
1210,1210, No.
1211,1211, It works.
1212,1212,Aladdin...
1213,1213,At the two ...
1214,1214, How he had to flatten himself!
1215,1215,Like shit!
1216,1216, The princess tried to kill me.
1217,1217, The princess tried to kill me.
1218,1218,He is so funny!
1219,1219, Ouch!
1220,1220, Battle cushions!
1221,1221, Hush!
1222,1222,Master.
1223,1223,You murder?
1224,1224, She tried to make me fall from the balcony.
1225,1225," How lucky you are, master."
1226,1226,"Fall off the balcony, think."
1227,1227,"In a woman, that means to make you fall in love."
1228,1228,"To fall in love, it just fell off the balcony."
1229,1229,That's what it means.
1230,1230,"It's awesome ! Bravo, it's successful."
1231,1231, I succeeded?
1232,1232, Eh yes !
1233,1233," Oh, I did not understand."
1234,1234, It bothers you if I ...
1235,1235, Absolutely not.
1236,1236," Good evening, master. No no !"
1237,1237,No no no!
1238,1238, That'll teach you to fuck you out of my mouth.
1239,1239,"Come on, pillow fight."
1240,1240,"Yeah, pillow fight! Go!"
1241,1241,Battle of cushions! Go!
1242,1242, Yes ?
1243,1243, Boss!
1244,1244, Aladin is back.
1245,1245, What?
1246,1246,What is it ?
1247,1247, We pursued him and he fell off the cliff.
1248,1248,Oh!
1249,1249,What a pity !
1250,1250, He is dead while trying to escape.
1251,1251, He is dead ?
1252,1252, Like a coward.
1253,1253, How sad !
1254,1254," I found his lamp, boss."
1255,1255, Wahid ...
1256,1256,I increase you by two dinars.
1257,1257," It's here, at your place?"
1258,1258," Nice, huh?"
1259,1259, It's beautiful and big.
1260,1260,How do you heat?
1261,1261, Electric heating.
1262,1262, It must be expensive.
1263,1263," Nothing at all. I do 2 or 3 pubs for EDF, they show it to me."
1264,1264, But no?
1265,1265, Really cool !
1266,1266," That's it, Aladinde's lamp?"
1267,1267,"I polish it, I polish it ..."
1268,1268,"Help me, Aladdin!"
1269,1269, I've got you !
1270,1270,I've got you !
1271,1271, Help me !
1272,1272,It's too hard !
1273,1273, Someone there ?
1274,1274,Oh ! Is there anyone there? Hello?
1275,1275, Aladdin !
1276,1276, AIIÃ?
1277,1277, Hold on !
1278,1278," It does not work, that."
1279,1279,Oh ! Hello? Engineering?
1280,1280,Engineering?
1281,1281,Wahid!
1282,1282,What is this rotten lamp?
1283,1283, No no no!
1284,1284,I'm bald now.
1285,1285," Before, for you, what were you?"
1286,1286, I had something ...
1287,1287, Shah Zaman!
1288,1288, No !
1289,1289,Whore...
1290,1290, What?
1291,1291, I'm not Shah Zaman.
1292,1292, No ? What?
1293,1293, I'm his double.
1294,1294,No ?
1295,1295, My name is Augustin.
1296,1296, I am sorry !
1297,1297," Ah, you could not know."
1298,1298, Here.
1299,1299, Whore !
1300,1300,I come from La Castellane. Marseille.
1301,1301, He is hurt.
1302,1302," Well, he's dead."
1303,1303,I need to circulate discreetly.
1304,1304,Can you turn me into a guard?
1305,1305, Check that.
1306,1306," Well, huh?"
1307,1307,"Wait, what's this voice?"
1308,1308, That voice is fine.
1309,1309, What's this voice?
1310,1310,I have a weird voice.
1311,1311, It's not the worst.
1312,1312, What do you mean ?
1313,1313, No.
1314,1314, I have spots ?
1315,1315, No.
1316,1316, Oh ! What's this nose?
1317,1317, Impeccable.
1318,1318, He's fat.
1319,1319, You know what ?
1320,1320, Give me back as I was.
1321,1321, It is enough that you snap your fingers to become again as you were.
1322,1322,But it's good.
1323,1323," It's good, I have no voice ..."
1324,1324,"Oh yeah, yeah, it's coming back."
1325,1325, Are we all right?
1326,1326, Let's go.
1327,1327, Wow.
1328,1328," Go on, quiet."
1329,1329,Enter without knocking.
