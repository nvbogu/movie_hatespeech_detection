137,137, Looks like the sun.
138,138, The sun?
139,139, Seems to be shining upwards.
140,140, Strange.
141,141, How's the gas?
142,142, Terrible. It kept me awake all night.
143,143,"No, no, no!"
144,144,The gasoline in the tank!
145,145,Oh. Almost empty.
146,146,We must be nearly there.
147,147,What time is it?
148,148,Time?
149,149,"About, approximately, one minute to 12:00."
150,150,Strange.
151,151,Look at that.
152,152,Seem to be defying the laws of gravity.
153,153,Water!
154,154, Huh?
155,155, Quick! I'm going to faint!
156,156,"Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh  You'll get  We'll get into trouble if you faint any more now."

163,163," Here, take it!"
164,164, Oh! Quick!
165,165,There's something wrong.
166,166,"Oh, I can't reach it."
167,167,"Oh, water! Faint!"
168,168,"Ah! Oh, it's all gone!"
169,169,What's the matter?
170,170, This belt is too tight.
171,171," Well, loosen it."
172,172,I'm trying to.
173,173,We're upside down.
174,174, I know it.
175,175, Give me that stick!
176,176,Impossible.
177,177,Oh. There it goes.
178,178,We're out of gas.
179,179,"Well, I suppose this is the end."
180,180, Cigarette?
181,181, Not now.
182,182,Then I shan't need this anymore.
183,183,What month is it?
184,184,April.
185,185,Spring in Tomainia.
186,186,Hilda will be in the garden now tending the daffodils.
187,187,How she loves daffodils.
188,188,She would never cut them for fear of hurting them.
189,189,It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil.
190,190,"Sweet, gentle Hilda."
191,191,A beautiful soul.
192,192,And she loved animals.
193,193,And little children too.
194,194,We've landed! Dispatches!
195,195,"Comrade, where are you?"
196,196,Comrade!
197,197,"Comrade, the dispatches!"
198,198,"Tell me, where are they?"
199,199, Are you hurt?
200,200, Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!
201,201, What's that?
202,202," Hurry, man!"
203,203,"If I don't deliver these dispatches at once, we're defeated!"
204,204," Well, the war's over."
205,205, What?
206,206, We lost.
207,207, Lost?
208,208,Hynkel Party Takes Power!
209,209,"Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier, exbarber, veteran of the World War..."
210,210,suffered a loss of memory and remained an inmate of the soldier's hospital for many years.
211,211,He was ignorant of the profound change that had come over Tomainia.
212,212,Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation with an iron fist.
213,213,Under the new emblem of the Double Cross liberty was banished...
214,214,free speech was suppressed...
215,215,and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.
216,216,...und ze sauerkraut!
217,217,Baloney.
218,218,Baloney  Adenoid Hynkel has just said...
219,219,"yesterday Tomainia was down, but today she has risen."
220,220,Democratzy shtunk!
221,221,Democracy is fragrant.
222,222,Liberty shtunk!
223,223,Liberty is odious.
224,224,Free sprechen shtunk!
225,225,Freedom of speech is objectionable.
226,226,Tomainia has the greatest army in the world.
227,227,The greatest navy in the world.
228,228,But to remain great we must sacrifice.
229,229,We must tighten our belts.
230,230,Hail Hynkel!
231,231,"Ah, Herring."
232,232,Poopschen Herring.
233,233,Bismarck Herring!
234,234,"The Phooey now speaks to the Field Marshal Herring, the minister of war."
235,235,From the hearten...
236,236,Und Garbitsch. Herr Garbitsch.
237,237,"He is now addressing Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior."

240,240,und Garbitsch shutten smelten fine from Herring.
241,241,Herring und Garbitsch.
242,242,His Excellency recalls the struggles of his early days...
243,243,shared by his two loyal comrades.
244,244,"Ah, und the Aryan..."
245,245,"und the Aryan maiden  Ah, the Aryan maiden."
246,246,"Ah, the delicatessen mit ze schoe..."

260,260,"Ohh, der Juden."
261,261,His Excellency has just referred to the Jewish people.
262,262,Und now...

269,269,"In conclusion, the Phooey remarks..."
270,270,that for the rest of the world he has nothing but peace in his heart.
271,271,We now pause for station identification.
272,272,This is the Perimutuel Network...
273,273,bringing you direct from Tomainia Adenoid Hynkel's address...
274,274,to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross.
275,275,"The English Interpreter is Heinrich Schtick, Adenoid Hynkel's personal translator..."
276,276,who is apparently reading from a prepared manuscript.
277,277,Stand by for further commentary.
278,278,"Go ahead, Tomainia."
279,279,His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.
280,280,Ach! Ohh! Your Excellency!
281,281,Are you hurt?
282,282,Straff! Straff da fluten flavin da cheesen cracken!

291,291,Banana.
292,292,"Inside, da booben."
293,293,You ride in the other car.
294,294,"Thank you, children."
295,295,His Excellency seems well pleased...
296,296,as he's greeted by a committee of Tomainian children and their mothers.
297,297,Now he pauses before a woman with a child.
298,298,Camera.
299,299,Even the baby is thrilled...
300,300,and seems all smiles at His Excellency's attention.
301,301,Hail Hynkel!
302,302,His Excellency leaves the scene of his triumph...
303,303,"and will return to the palace along Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture..."
304,304,where he will pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces...
305,305,The Venus of Today and The Thinker of Tomorrow.
306,306, How was it?
307,307, The speech?
308,308, Yes.
309,309," Oh, very good."
310,310,Thought your reference to the Jews might have been a little more violent.
311,311, What?
312,312, You've got to rouse the people's anger.
313,313,"At this time, violence against the Jews might take the public's mind off its stomach."
314,314,Hmm. Perhaps you're right.
315,315,Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately.
316,316,"Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel."
317,317,What's good about it?
318,318,"Well, conditions could be worse."
319,319,"If you think they could be worse, you have a great imagination."
320,320,Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.
321,321,I heard nothing.
322,322,I've got my own troubles.
323,323,"Well, you're better off than a lot of other people."
324,324, What have you heard from the barber?
325,325, Still in the hospital.
326,326,Aye. Ever since the war he's been there.
327,327,Yep.
328,328,Why don't you try and rent his barbershop for him?
329,329,He won't let me.
330,330,Every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
331,331,It seems a pity it should be idle all these years.
332,332,"Well, why worry?"
333,333,With the taxes the government will soon take it away from him.
334,334,"Aye, perhaps you're right."
335,335,It isn't such a good morning after all.
336,336,Now you said it.
337,337, Hannah.
338,338," Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?"
339,339,On the mantelpiece you'll find my tobacco pouch.
340,340, Will you get it?
341,341," All right, Mr. Jaeckel."
342,342,"Yeah, seems everyone is full of troubles."
343,343,"Ah, everyone."
344,344,"Look at Hannah, poor girl."
345,345,A hard worker.
346,346,Can't get a job.
347,347,Father was killed in the war.
348,348,Mother died last year.
349,349,Can't earn enough to pay the rent for her room. What can I do?
350,350,I can't throw her out.
351,351, You'll need some more tobacco.
352,352, Where are you going?
353,353,I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.
354,354,"Oh, you'd better take the key."
355,355,Mrs. Jaeckel and myself are going out.
356,356,I'm locking up all the doors...
357,357,in case the storm troopers will start their monkey business again.
358,358," The Aryan   The AryAryAryAryAryan   As we go marching by  Look, fellas! Tomatoes!"
359,359,And potatoes!
360,360,I think I'll take a box home.
361,361,"Mister, please, please."
362,362,"Hey, fellas, the truck!"
363,363,"Hold it there, will ya!"
364,364,You have no right to do this.
365,365,That's all right.
366,366,Just charge it to my account.
367,367,"Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!"
368,368,Why don't some of you do something?
369,369,I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.
370,370,"Now what would you do, my pretty maid?"
371,371,"Ah, you're very brave all together, but not one of ya got guts to stand up alone and fight."
372,372," Aw, shut up!"
373,373, Is that why you got a truck?
374,374, To run away in case somebody hits you back?
375,375," Shut up, or we'll take you down."
376,376,"All right, come on and take me."
377,377,You'll get a lot of medals for it.
378,378,That's all you can do is to pick on women and rob defenseless people.
379,379,"Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys."
380,380,Give her back her tomatoes.
381,381,Here!
382,382,"Oh, I'll have to do it all over again."
383,383,Pigs.
384,384, Send in patient 33.
385,385," Yes, sir."
386,386,Here's an interesting case.
387,387,Amnesia. Jewish soldier.
388,388,Been here since the war.
389,389,Has an idea he's been here only a few weeks.
390,390,Has he any idea what's happened in the meantime?
391,391,Not the least.
392,392,"His one interest seems to be in his barbershop, which he believes he left only a few weeks ago."
393,393,Poor devil. He'll have many surprises waiting for him.
394,394,I'm afraid so.
395,395, Yes?
396,396, Number 33 is gone.
397,397,Gone?
398,398,But he was to be examined.
399,399," I know, sir, but he disappeared."
400,400, Disappeared?
401,401,"Well, let him go."
402,402,It isn't a serious case.
403,403,"Besides, there's little more we can do for him."
404,404,"Hey, go on."
405,405,Beat it up there.
406,406,Come on! Get outta  You! Go on!
407,407,What do you think you're doing?
408,408, I really don't know.
409,409," Well, you leave that alone."
410,410, Don't be silly.
411,411, I'm not silly!
412,412,I appreciate that.
413,413,"When you talk to me, hail Hynkel and salute."
414,414,Who are you anyway?
415,415,I'll show you who I am.
416,416,Come down to headquarters.
417,417," Say, that's my shop!"
418,418, I don't care if it is or not.
419,419, You leave me alone!
420,420," Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?"
421,421,"Come on down, pal."
422,422,I'll show you.

424,424,Arrest that man for assault.
425,425," Come here, you!"
426,426, Leave me alone!
427,427,"Attacking a storm trooper, huh?"
428,428, Take him down!
429,429, You'll hear from my lawyer!
430,430," Come on, you little   Why, you  Turn him around!"
431,431,He bit my finger!
432,432,Pardon.
433,433,"Oh, I'm sorry, mister."
434,434,I didn't mean to hit you.
435,435,You were wonderful.
436,436,I enjoyed that.
437,437, But don't stand there. You'd better beat it.
438,438," No, I'll call a policeman."
439,439," No, no, don't do that."
440,440, Why not?
441,441,You crazy?
442,442, Look out. There's more coming.
443,443, More what?
444,444,Wait a minute!
445,445,Come in here!
446,446,What's wrong with you?
447,447,There's no use being foolhardy.

450,450,Stop the car!
451,451,Hello! What's this?
452,452,Who hit you?
453,453, I don't know. I think there were a gang of 'em.
454,454," Here, you'd better go along, get fixed up."
455,455,We'll investigate later.
456,456, What time is it?
457,457, Come on. Get in.
458,458,I don't see what is  It's all right now.
459,459,They've gone.
460,460,"Thanks, mister."
461,461,That did me a lot of good.
462,462,"You sure got nerve, the way you fought back."
463,463,That's what we should all do  fight back.
464,464,"We can't fight alone, but we can lick 'em together."
465,465,"We didn't do so bad, did we?"
466,466,So long.
467,467,"Oh, excuse me."
468,468,"You're the barber, the one that was in the hospital."
469,469,Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
470,470,We didn't think you were ever coming back.
471,471,"But the storm troopers, they'll be looking for ya."
472,472,Storm troopers?
473,473,You'd better hide.
474,474,Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.
475,475, Is this the man?
476,476, That's him.
477,477,Hail Hynkel.
478,478,Who's he?
479,479,Don't fool with me.
480,480,"I said, hail Hynkel!"
481,481, All right.
482,482, Put out your hands.
483,483,Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
484,484,Bring him outside.
485,485,"Yes. Come on, you."
486,486,Come on!
487,487,Before we take you down you'll finish this. Here.
488,488,Go on. Paint that.
489,489,"Why, you  That's him!"
490,490,"Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!"
491,491,I've got an idea.
492,492,A bright idea.
493,493,Sure! That's it!
494,494, And... give it the works!
495,495, Heave ho!
496,496,Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!
497,497,Attention!
498,498,First in command.
499,499," Yes, sir."
500,500, What the  Second in command.
501,501," Yes, sir."
502,502," Oh, never mind."
503,503, You!
504,504," Yes, sir."
505,505,What the devil goes on here? And who told you to hang people from lampposts?
506,506," No one, sir."
507,507, My orders were to keep these streets tidy.
508,508, What was the trouble?
509,509," A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir."
510,510, Where is he?
511,511, There.
512,512,Break ranks.
513,513,"Oh, so there you are."
514,514,Stand him up.
515,515,Get up.
516,516,You!
517,517,Don't you remember me?
518,518,The war.
519,519,You saved my life.
520,520, Me?
521,521, Strange.
522,522,And I always thought of you as an Aryan.
523,523, I'm a vegetarian.
524,524," Well, don't you remember?"
525,525,"The enemy tried to capture us, but we got away in my plane."
526,526,Plane?
527,527,And then we crashed.
528,528,"Cra  Oh, yes."
529,529,Now I remember.
530,530," Well, how are you?"
531,531, What has my friend done?
532,532,"Our men were painting his windows, Commander, and he resisted."
533,533,Any brave man would resist.
534,534, I'm sorry this occurred.
535,535, Oh. No harm.
536,536,I'm sure that in the future you will not be molested again.
537,537,"However, if you or your friends are ever in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know."
538,538,Who did that?
539,539,Oh. One of my friends.
540,540,Oh. Of course.
541,541,Hynkel's palace was the center of a gigantic enterprise...
542,542,an enterprise that would build the world's greatest war machine.
543,543,Behind this undertaking was the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...
544,544,whose amazing genius ran the entire nation...
545,545,whose ceaseless activity kept him busily occupied every moment of the day.
546,546,Hup!
547,547,"Marshal Herring is waiting, Your Excellency."
548,548,Enough.
549,549,Hail Hynkel.
550,550,"Your Excellency, I believe we've got something now."
551,551,A bulletproof uniform.
552,552,Material as light as silk.
553,553, Where is it?
554,554, I've arranged for a demonstration in the anteroom.
555,555,It will only take two minutes.
556,556,I can spare one.
557,557, Professor Herr Kibitzen!
558,558, Hail Hynkel!
559,559,"Your Excellency, actions speak louder than words."
560,560, A bulletproof uniform!
561,561, And 100% perfect!
562,562,Shoot.
563,563,Far from perfect.
564,564,Zevell!
565,565, My secretary. Where is she?
566,566," In the outer office, Your Excellency."
567,567, Call her.
568,568," Yes, sir."
569,569,Hail Hynkel.
570,570,Take a letter.
571,571,"No! No, no!"
572,572, Hello?
573,573, This is Field Marshal Herring.
574,574,I'm in the Tower Room.
575,575,We've got something marvelous.
576,576,All right. I shall be up.
577,577, What is it?
578,578, A parachute.
579,579,The most compact in the world.
580,580,Worn like an ordinary hat.
581,581,It will open in 25 feet.
582,582,"Demonstrate, Professor."
583,583,Hail Hynkel!
584,584,"Herring, why do you waste my time like this?"
585,585,Send Garbitsch here.
586,586,"Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency."
587,587,Enough.
588,588,Hail Hynkel.
589,589,"Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this, these appropriations?"
590,590,every penny for the manufacturing of munitions.
591,591, We've had to make a few arrests.
592,592, A few? How many?
593,593,Nothing astronomical.
594,594,Five or ten thousand.
595,595, Oh.
596,596, A day.
597,597, A day?
598,598," Just a few dissenters, that's all."
599,599, What do they dissent about?
600,600, The working hours. The cut in wages.
601,601,"Chiefly, the synthetic food  the quality of the sawdust in the bread."
602,602,What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply.
603,603,"Nevertheless, the condition is getting dangerous."
604,604,The people are overworked.
605,605,They need diversion.
606,606,The people? Bah!
607,607,We might go a little further with the Jews.
608,608,Burn down some of their houses.
609,609,Spectacular assault on the ghetto now might prove diverting.
610,610,We must do something more dramatic.
611,611,Now is the time to invade Osterlich.
612,612, How soon can we be ready?
613,613," According to Herring, three months."
614,614,"I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's army might invade Osterlich before me."
615,615,We must strike now.
616,616,"In that case, we should require foreign capital."
617,617, Borrow it. Borrow it.
618,618, The bankers have all refused.
619,619,But wait. There's one man who might make us a loan  Epstein.
620,620,Epstein?
621,621,"He's a Jew, isn't he?"
622,622,Yes.
623,623,"Well, let's be big about it."
624,624,We'll borrow the money from Epstein.
625,625,It might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people.
626,626,Very well then.
627,627,We'll change our policy towards his people.
628,628,Tell Commander Schultz that in future all persecution of the Jews must cease...
629,629,at least until we've negotiated this loan.
630,630,I don't understand it.
631,631,The whole ghetto is so quiet now.
632,632,You can't imagine what was going on while you were away.
633,633,"Oh, this Hynkel business."
634,634,You weren't here.
635,635,"You were in the hospital, unconscious."
636,636,"Believe me, you don't appreciate what a good time you were having."
637,637,"Well, if things get worse we can go to Osterlich."
638,638,That's still a free country.
639,639,Sooner or later we'll have to go.
640,640, Excuse me.
641,641, Anyway...
642,642,it's nice to see you back.
643,643,"It's like the old days again, eh?"
644,644, Yes.
645,645, How's business?
646,646,Very slow. Very slow.
647,647,"Trouble is, the men are all in concentration camps."
648,648,You should go in for fixing up the women.
649,649,Nice money in the beauty parlor business.
650,650,You know anything about it?
651,651,Me? No.
652,652,"Well, you can learn."
653,653,You can practice on Hannah.
654,654,Yes!
655,655,Of course.
656,656,"Hannah, get up in that chair."
657,657,We are going to make you look beautiful.
658,658,Beautiful? What for?
659,659,He's going to practice on you for a beauty parlor.
660,660,"You're not gonna put mud on my face, are you?"
661,661,"Ah, we are going to take some off."
662,662,Make me look beautiful?
663,663,Sure. We can't make you look any worse.
664,664, Hannah!
665,665," Oh, there's Mrs. Shoemaker for the laundry."
666,666,That's all right.
667,667,I'll give it to her.
668,668, You sit here and enjoy yourself.
669,669, What?
670,670,I know.
671,671,I've seen you making eyes.
672,672,Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.
673,673,I like your shop since we fixed it up.
674,674,I wish I had a business like this.
675,675,There's no future in housework.
676,676,Maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop someday.
677,677,But I can never save.
678,678,Money slips through my fingers like that.
679,679,"Trouble is, I've always lived up to every penny I've earned."
680,680,Why shouldn't I? You're here today and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?
681,681, Do you believe in God?
682,682," Well  I do. But if there wasn't one, would you live any different?"
683,683,I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone.
684,684,Things are looking brighter now.
685,685,"Maybe you're the reason, saving Commander Schultz's life."
686,686,Funny how they've left us alone lately.
687,687,Seems too good to be true.
688,688,Do you ever daydream?
689,689,I do.
690,690,That's the only time I'm really happy  dreaming.
691,691,Back.
692,692,Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?
693,693, Do you know we're very much alike?
694,694, Are we?
695,695,Yeah.
696,696,We're both absentminded.
697,697, You think so?
698,698, Yes.
699,699,I like absentminded people.
700,700,Do you know the story about the man that put his watch in boiling water...
701,701,and held the egg in his hand?
702,702,No!
703,703,Very good.
704,704,They say all great men are absentminded.
705,705,It's a sign they're smart.
706,706,My folks didn't think so.
707,707,Of course there's an excuse for you.
708,708,You were injured in the war.
709,709,I was born that way.
710,710,Wonder why women never grow whiskers.
711,711,Hmm? What?
712,712,"I s  What   Oh, my!"
713,713, Isn't that foolish of me!
714,714,"I could kick myself in the shins, I could."
715,715,I'll give you a shampoo.
716,716,That's good.
717,717,VoilÃ .
718,718,Gee.
719,719,Ain't I cute!
720,720,How'd you do it?
721,721,You should try it on yourself.
722,722,"If you were fixed up, you'd look handsome."
723,723, Yes?
724,724, Yes!
725,725,No.
726,726,Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!
727,727,There's the potato man.
728,728,I have to go.
729,729,Potatoes!
730,730,"One, please!"
731,731,Take it easy there.
732,732,"Well, did you hurt yourself?"
733,733, Careful next time.
734,734, Here's another one.
735,735,How do you do?
736,736,Something's happened. I know it.
737,737,"The storm troopers, they helped me up."
738,738,Wouldn't it be wonderful if they stopped hating us...
739,739,if they'd leave us alone and let us go about our business like we used to.
740,740,Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't have to leave and go to another country?
741,741,"I don't want to go away. With all the hardship and the persecution, I love it here."
742,742,Perhaps we don't have to go.
743,743,Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
744,744,Period.
745,745,Danke schoen.
746,746,Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
747,747,Not even a sharp pencil!
748,748,"I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers!"
749,749, I'll get you a pen.
750,750, Don't bother.
751,751,I won't send it.
752,752,Get out! Get out! Get out!
753,753,"We've just discovered the most wonderful, the most marvelous poison gas!"
754,754,It will kill everybody!
755,755,"All right, later, later, later."
756,756,B76 to see Herr Herring.
757,757, Who's that?
758,758, A lady.
759,759,My secret agent.
760,760,Your secret agent.
761,761,Tell her to come here.
762,762,Have B76 come right in.
763,763,Hail Hynkel.
764,764," Oh, Garbitsch, what do you hear from Epstein?"
765,765, Most encouraging.
766,766,"Our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans, so the loan is bound to go through."
767,767, Good.
768,768, Hail Hynkel.
769,769,Come here.
770,770, Well?
771,771, The men are planning a strike at the arms factory.
772,772, Who's the leader?
773,773, There were five of them.
774,774, Have them shot.
775,775," They were, Your Excellency."
776,776, How many do you say were going on strike?
777,777," The whole factory  3,000 of them."
778,778,Have them all shot. I don't want any of my workers dissatisfied.
779,779,"But, Your Excellency, these men are skilled craftsmen."
780,780,"Why not let them work till they can train others, then shoot them?"
781,781,We cannot afford to be lenient!
782,782,The whole rhythm of production will be affected if you shoot them now.
783,783,"""Rhythm of production. "" All right, have your rhythms."
784,784,You may instruct your operatives to spare the strikers and permit them to return to work...
785,785,but to mark them for future reference.
786,786,That is my department.
787,787,I'll attend to that.
788,788,"This way, madam."
789,789,Strange. These strike leaders  they're all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.
790,790,Brunettes are troublemakers.
791,791,They're worse than the Jews.
792,792,Then wipe them out.
793,793,Doucement.
794,794,Not so fast.
795,795,We get rid of the Jews first.
796,796,Then concentrate on the brunettes.
797,797,We shall never have peace until we have a pure Aryan race.
798,798,How wonderful.
799,799,"Tomainia, a nation of blueeyed blondes."
800,800,"Why not a blonde Europe, a blonde Asia, a blonde America?"
801,801, A blonde world.
802,802, And a brunette dictator.
803,803,Dictator of the world.
804,804,Why not?
805,805,Aut Caesar aut nulles.
806,806,"The world is effete, wornout, afraid."
807,807,No nation would dare to oppose you.
808,808, Dictator of the world!
809,809, It's your destiny.
810,810,"We'll kill off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes."
811,811,Then will come forth our dream  a pure Aryan race.
812,812, Beautiful blonde Aryans.
813,813, They will love you. They will adore you.
814,814, They will worship you as a god!
815,815," No, no! You mustn't say it!"
816,816,You make me afraid of myself.
817,817,"Yes, dictator of the world."
818,818,We'll start with the invasion of Osterlich.
819,819,After that we won't have to fight.
820,820,We can bluff.
821,821,Nation after nation will capitulate.
822,822,Within two years the world will be under your thumb!
823,823,Leave me.
824,824,I want to be alone.
825,825,Aut Caesar aut nulles.
826,826,Emperor of the world!
827,827,My world.
828,828,This is the Happy Hour program.
829,829,Make your work a pleasure.
830,830,Move with the rhythm of music.
831,831,"Our next selection: Brahms' ""Hungarian Dance No. 5."" Fifteen cents, please."
832,832,The Happy Hour program now signing off.
833,833,At 6:00 all stations will carry Adenoid Hynkel's address...
834,834,to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross.
835,835,"Seems like the old days again, don't it?"
836,836,I wonder how long they are going to last.
837,837,Don't you read the papers?
838,838,It is rumored that Hynkel is going to give the Jewish people back their rights.
839,839,Hmm. Maybe.
840,840,What do you want?
841,841,Business is much better.
842,842,Nobody interferes with us anymore.
843,843,Now don't that make you feel good?
844,844,"No, sir."
845,845,"The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is, you're so used to bad times you're unhappy without them."
846,846,Mary? Mary!
847,847,Get my Sunday shoes.
848,848, You'll find them on the window sill.
849,849, All right.
850,850, I can't find the shawl.
851,851, Don't bother. I've got the shawl.
852,852, What's going on upstairs?
853,853, It's Hannah.
854,854,They're dressing her up to go out this evening.
855,855, Is that so?
856,856, She's got a beau.
857,857, Who is it?
858,858, The barber.
859,859,Now turn around.
860,860,"Oh, my dear, those hands."
861,861, What's the matter with them?
862,862, Those calluses  they're so rough.
863,863, Maybe I'd better not go.
864,864, Don't be foolish.
865,865,He knows you do housework.
866,866,Wait a minute.
867,867,I'll get a pair of mittens from Mrs. Morris.
868,868, Mrs. Morris?
869,869," Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!"
870,870,Aggie.
871,871, Yeah?
872,872, See if he's ready yet.
873,873,All right.
874,874,Not yet.
875,875,He's polishing a bald man's head.
876,876,Bad news.
877,877,The invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed.
878,878, What?
879,879, Epstein refuses to lend us the money.
880,880,"Epstein refuses, huh?"
881,881,Send for Schultz!
882,882,Commander Schultz.
883,883,Epstein refuses!
884,884,That contemptible Epstein!
885,885,What did he say?
886,886,He complained of the persecution of his people...
887,887,and said under no circumstances would he have any dealings with a medieval maniac.
888,888,He'll deal with a medieval maniac more than he thinks!
889,889,"First I shall deal with ""his people. "" Your Excellency?"
890,890,"Schultz, call out the storm troopers."
891,891,We're going to stage a little medieval entertainment in the ghetto.
892,892,"At such a time, Your Excellency, I think it's illadvised."
893,893,What?
894,894,Demonstrations of this kind are demoralizing the whole country.
895,895,Indeed.
896,896,And since when have you been so concerned about the ghetto?
897,897,I speak in the interests of our party and for the cause of humanity.
898,898,Schultz.
899,899,You need a vacation.
900,900,Fresh air.
901,901,A little outdoor exercise.
902,902,I shall send you to a concentration camp.
903,903,Guards!
904,904,Place Commander Schultz under arrest.
905,905,"Very well, but remember my words."
906,906,"Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people."
907,907,Your policy is worse than a crime.
908,908,It's a tragic blunder.
909,909,Traitor! Traitor!
910,910,You're nothing but a doubledyed democrat!
911,911,"Schultz, why have you forsaken me?"
912,912,"Excellency, here are the notes for your speech."
913,913,Thank you.
914,914,I'll not need them.
915,915,What I say tonight will not be directed to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross...
916,916,but to the children of Israel.
917,917, Ah. Good evening.
918,918, Good evening.
919,919,Good night.
920,920,Good night.
921,921,"Do you know, that Hynkel isn't such a bad fella after all."
922,922,Most amusing.
923,923,Here you are.
924,924,Get a Hynkel button. Get a Hynkel button.
925,925,A fine photo of the Phooey on each and every button.
926,926,"Two? Here you are, young man."
927,927,... the doublecrossin'!
928,928,But the Juden! The Juden!
929,929,...und the ghetto...
930,930,The ghetto   We'd better go home.
931,931, Yeah.
932,932,"Come on, let's hurry."
933,933,Wait a minute. No!
934,934,...the Juden. The Juden  The Juden! The Juden!
935,935,Hey.
936,936,What's that?
937,937,Turn off the radio!
938,938,Listen!
939,939," The Aryan, the Aryan  It's the storm troopers!"
940,940,"No, no!"
941,941," The AryAryAryAryAryan  Oh, come on! Get in!"
942,942,Come on! Come on! Get in!
943,943, The AryAryAryAryAryan   Bar that door!
944,944, Get some water!
945,945,Mr. Jaeckel.
946,946,"Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel!"
947,947,"Oh, my dear!"
948,948,"What is it, dear?"
949,949,"Mother, get the women and children up here."
950,950,Lock all the doors.
951,951,"Here. You men, stay right here."
952,952,We've got to make a stand.
953,953,We might as well die as to go on living like this.
954,954, The AryAryAryAryAryan  Wait a minute!
955,955,We have a social call to make here!
956,956,It's Hynkel!
957,957,Wait a minute!
958,958,What do you think you're doing?
959,959,Commander Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court.
960,960,These Jews were attacking storm troopers.
961,961,I don't care what they were doing.
962,962,The orders were to keep out of here.
963,963,There! You saw that for yourself!
964,964,I can't help it.
965,965,Those are Commander Schultz's orders.
966,966,Come on. Let's get going.
967,967,Come on.
968,968," Aryan   The AryAryAryAryAryan  Orders or no orders, I'm gonna get that girl."
969,969,Out.
970,970,Aww.
971,971,Extry! Paper!
972,972, Schultz arrested! Paper!
973,973, Did you hear that?
974,974, He's arrested Commander Schultz.
975,975, What?
976,976,Commander Schultz has been arrested!
977,977, Troopers!
978,978, Listen.
979,979, A Jew corrupted our commander!
980,980, Let's kill the lot of them!
981,981,"Commander Schultz is under arrest, accused of treason!"
982,982,"And you know why. Schultz was a friend of the ghetto, a friend of that barber!"
983,983, Let's get the barber!
984,984, We want the barber!
985,985,We want the barber!
986,986, It's the storm troopers! They're after you!
987,987, We want the barber!
988,988, You better get up on the roof.
989,989, No. I'll stay here.
990,990,Come on! They'll kill you!
991,991," No, I'll stay and fight!"
992,992, Don't be a fool!
993,993,Do you want to be murdered?
994,994,Get on to the roof. Quick!
995,995, Come on! Come on!
996,996," Agar, get inside."
997,997,We want the barber!
998,998,We want the barber!
999,999,We want the barber!
1000,1000,"All right, here we are!"
1001,1001,Smash in the door! Come on!
1002,1002,"Come on, boys!"
1003,1003,"Come on, boys!"
1004,1004,We'll give the barber a haircut!
1005,1005," All right, where are the bombs?"
1006,1006, Come on. This way!
1007,1007,Let 'er go!
1008,1008," Aryan, the AryAryAryAryAryan  There goes the barbershop."
1009,1009,Never mind. We can start again.
1010,1010,We can go to Osterlich.
1011,1011,That's still a free country.
1012,1012,Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.
1013,1013,"Wonderful green fields, and they grow apples and grapes."
1014,1014,Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard in Osterlich.
1015,1015,"And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there, he said he'd take me with him."
1016,1016,Now we can all go together.
1017,1017,It'll be wonderful living in the country.
1018,1018,Much better than a smoky old city.
1019,1019,"And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money."
1020,1020,We can buy a chicken farm.
1021,1021,There's nice money to be made in chickens.
1022,1022,Look at that star.
1023,1023,Isn't it beautiful?
1024,1024,One thing  Hynkel with all his power can never touch that.
1025,1025,It's all right now.
1026,1026,The coast is clear. Listen.
1027,1027,Commander Schultz escaped.
1028,1028,He's hiding in my cellar.
1029,1029,What?
1030,1030,He's holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
1031,1031,"Hannah, you too come down..."
1032,1032,and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.
1033,1033,All right. I'll be down.
1034,1034,I don't understand it.
1035,1035,This crazy midnight supper.
1036,1036,What does this Commander Schultz want of us?
1037,1037,He wants us to blow up the palace.
1038,1038,What?
1039,1039,We Jewish people shouldn't get mixed up in such a business.
1040,1040,"I know it, but Commander Schultz is such a good talker, he has them all hypnotized."
1041,1041,I knew he was up to some mischief.
1042,1042,"Sure, he is!"
1043,1043,I came in the kitchen this evening...
1044,1044,and found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
1045,1045,Putting a coin in one of the puddings?
1046,1046,But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
1047,1047,Wait and see.
1048,1048,"Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?"
1049,1049,We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
1050,1050,"In order to carry out this plan, one of us must die."
1051,1051,"In ancient times, the Aryan tribe of Langobardians..."
1052,1052,made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
1053,1053,At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
1054,1054,Tonight at this feast one of you will be chosen.
1055,1055,Each man will receive a pudding.
1056,1056,Concealed in one of these is a coin.
1057,1057,Whoever gets that coin must give up his life for the liberation of his people.
1058,1058,But he will join the long line of history's noble martyrs...
1059,1059,and will rid his country of a tyrant.
1060,1060,Ooh!
1061,1061,I know that it is the wish of all of us...
1062,1062,to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
1063,1063,Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal...
1064,1064,I cannot.
1065,1065,Why?
1066,1066,Don't you understand?
1067,1067,He's too wellknown.
1068,1068,It must be done by somebody like us.
1069,1069,I can't see it like that.
1070,1070,"Gentlemen, if this is a question of my honor, it's very embarrassing."
1071,1071,"Commander Schultz, I apologize for my friend."
1072,1072,And let me say on behalf of myself and the others...
1073,1073,that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
1074,1074,"Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator."
1075,1075,"Until then, hail Hynk  Oh, what am I saying?"
1076,1076,"Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor."
1077,1077,Proceed.
1078,1078,"Gentlemen, the coin is here."
1079,1079,What's the meaning of all this?
1080,1080,Somebody made a fool of us.
1081,1081, You're quite right. I did.
1082,1082, What?
1083,1083,I put a coin in every pudding.
1084,1084,Mr. Jaeckel!
1085,1085,Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people.
1086,1086,We're in enough trouble as it is.
1087,1087,Hannah's right.
1088,1088,We've all been foolish.
1089,1089,"Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs."
1090,1090,Good night.
1091,1091,What's this?
1092,1092,Good night.
1093,1093,Good morning.
1094,1094,By the papers they are saying Commander Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.
1095,1095,Here it is. Read it for yourself.
1096,1096, Good morning.
1097,1097, Good morning.
1098,1098,"Hannah, here. Read that."
1099,1099,"""Mystery still surrounds the disappearance..."
1100,1100,of exCommander Schultz.
1101,1101,At police headquarters it was believed that the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.
1102,1102,"A certain Jewish barber, reported to be a friend of Schultz..."
1103,1103,"is also wanted for questioning. "" Me?"
1104,1104,"Well, if it's just for questioning, it can't be serious."
1105,1105,"Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning, and we never heard of him since."
1106,1106,Shh!
1107,1107, Who is it?
1108,1108, It's me  Mr. Mann.
1109,1109,"Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?"
1110,1110," How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?"
1111,1111, How do you do?
1112,1112,Did you hear what they're saying in the papers...
1113,1113,about Commander Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
1114,1114,"Oh, I know, I know."
1115,1115,"Well, don't you think that it's serious for you if they find him here in the house?"
1116,1116,Shh!
1117,1117,Don't you realize there are spies everywhere?
1118,1118,Spies?
1119,1119,What's the matter with him?
1120,1120,Didn't you read he's wanted for questioning?
1121,1121,Oy.
1122,1122,Where's the commander?
1123,1123,He's in the next room.
1124,1124,Let me tell you.
1125,1125,If Commander Schultz is found in this house...
1126,1126,we'll all go to the concentration camp for life and get our heads cut off in the bargain.
1127,1127,Am I giving you an argument?
1128,1128,Then get rid of him.
1129,1129,You can't throw him out.
1130,1130,Of course not.
1131,1131,"But I should like to know, how long is he going to stay here?"
1132,1132,That's all.
1133,1133,Come. Your breakfast is on the table.
1134,1134, Mr. Mann?
1135,1135, Thank you.
1136,1136,I have breakfast waiting at home.
1137,1137,Take the other side of the street and search every house.
1138,1138, Good morning.
1139,1139, Good morning.
1140,1140, What's wrong now?
1141,1141, They're looking for Commander Schultz.
1142,1142, Commander Schultz?
1143,1143, He's supposed to be hiding in one of those houses.
1144,1144,"Oh, they're always looking for somebody."
1145,1145, Who is it?
1146,1146, It's me. Let me in!
1147,1147," For heaven's sake, hurry up!"
1148,1148, Open the door.
1149,1149, They're coming this way.
1150,1150, What?
1151,1151,The storm troopers are searching every house.
1152,1152,Quick! Tell the commander.
1153,1153, Did you tell him?
1154,1154, Yes.
1155,1155, What is it?
1156,1156," The storm troopers, they're going to search the house."
1157,1157, What?
1158,1158, You'd better get up on the roof. Quick! Both of you!
1159,1159,Wait a minute!
1160,1160, We can't leave all these things about.
1161,1161," That's right. All of you, pack my valises."
1162,1162,You pack this valise.
1163,1163, Clear this shelf. Quickly.
1164,1164," Oh, yes."
1165,1165,Pack this and this.
1166,1166,"Oh, this mustn't be found here."
1167,1167,Open the door.
1168,1168,Listen! They are here!
1169,1169,Get up on the roof. Quick!
1170,1170, I'll take this.
1171,1171, Be sure they don't leave anything behind.
1172,1172, My golf clubs.
1173,1173, The hatbox!
1174,1174, Here. Take this.
1175,1175, Come on! Let's hurry!
1176,1176, Where are you going?
1177,1177, I'm going with him.
1178,1178,You stay here. You'll see him later.
1179,1179,Here. Take this.
1180,1180, I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
1181,1181, All right.
1182,1182,"Oh, take this."
1183,1183,Come on. Quick! Come on.
1184,1184,Open in the name of Hynkel!
1185,1185,Stop!
1186,1186, Look where you are.
1187,1187, Look where?
1188,1188,Look where you are.
1189,1189,"Wait, I can't  I can't see."
1190,1190,Wait a moment.
1191,1191, My bag! You've dropped it!
1192,1192," No, it's right here. Here it is."
1193,1193,Don't drop the other one!
1194,1194,Don't drop the other one!
1195,1195,My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!
1196,1196,Come off of there. They'll see you.
1197,1197,Quick! This way!
1198,1198,Whoa! Steady!
1199,1199,Now be careful.
1200,1200,"Yes, sir."
1201,1201,You were lucky you didn't break your neck.
1202,1202,"Yes, sir."
1203,1203,You'll pardon me.
1204,1204,Sorry.
1205,1205,You guard the back  Wait a minute.
1206,1206,I'm sorry.
1207,1207,I shall have to bother you again.
1208,1208,There he is!
1209,1209,"Well, good morning. How are you?"
1210,1210,"Oh, soso."
1211,1211,"Commander Schultz, who's your friend?"
1212,1212,"Remember, your silence will be appreciated."
1213,1213," Yes, sir."
1214,1214, Take him down to the wagon.
1215,1215,Come on.
1216,1216, Hey! Where you going?
1217,1217, To the smoking room.
1218,1218,"Ah, come on! Down this way!"
1219,1219,Osterlich.
1220,1220,Ja.
1221,1221,"Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce..."
1222,1222,that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
1223,1223,This was made possible by the enterprise and genius...
1224,1224,of Field Marshal Herring...
1225,1225,upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
1226,1226,...der Wiener schnitzel...

1228,1228,"Turn around. No. Ah, yes."
1229,1229,Gentlemen...

1234,1234,Wait.
1235,1235,Napaloni's mobilized his army on the Osterlich front.
1236,1236,What?
1237,1237,"Already 60,000 men are on the border."
1238,1238,He's going to take Osterlich!
1239,1239,I can't believe it.
1240,1240,You can't believe it?
1241,1241,"But, Your Excellency, I   You let him steal a march on us!"
1242,1242," No, I  You can't believe it?"
1243,1243,I did everything that was  I had the ground covered.

1251,1251,"Yes, Napaloni! Listen, you blockhead! Mobilize every division of the army and the air force."
1252,1252, Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
1253,1253, But war will be the end of us.
1254,1254, Do as I tell you.
1255,1255, Madness.

1257,1257, Very well. Will you sign this?
1258,1258," Yes, I'll  What is it?"
1259,1259, A declaration of war.

1262,1262,A pen!
1263,1263,I'll sign it! Napaloni.
1264,1264,Der grosser peanut!
1265,1265,Der cheesy ravioli!
1266,1266,There!
1267,1267,Hello?
1268,1268, It's Napaloni.
1269,1269, Wait a minute.
1270,1270,Napaloni?
1271,1271, You talk to him.
1272,1272, What shall I say?
1273,1273,"Be nice, affable, pleasant."
1274,1274,Hello?
1275,1275,"Well, well, well. How are you?"
1276,1276,Fine.
1277,1277,"No, he hasn't been playing very much lately."
1278,1278,You went around in '92? Really?
1279,1279,You want to speak to His Excellency?
1280,1280,Just now he's a little hoarse.
1281,1281,"Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk."
1282,1282,May I take a message?
1283,1283,He says no doubt you've heard of the movement of his troops on the Osterlich front...
1284,1284,and he'd like to discuss the matter with you.
1285,1285,Ask him to come here.
1286,1286,His Excellency would be delighted to invite you to Tomainia...
1287,1287,where you could discuss the matter.
1288,1288,Very well.
1289,1289,I'll make the necessary arrangements.
1290,1290,"Goodbye, Your Excellency."
1291,1291,He's coming.
1292,1292,Good. We'll give him the works.
1293,1293,We'll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known!
1294,1294,"Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me."
1295,1295,What shall I do with this?
1296,1296, What is it?
1297,1297, Your declaration of war.
1298,1298,Peace is declared.
1299,1299,"2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square..."
1300,1300,awaiting the arrival of Benzino Napaloni.
1301,1301,"Entering the station is our beloved Phooey, ready to greet his distinguished guest."
1302,1302,This historic meeting will cement a friendship...
1303,1303,that has long existed between our Phooey and the dictator of Bacteria.
1304,1304,Order... arms!
1305,1305,His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador.
1306,1306, How do you do?
1307,1307," Thank you, sir."
1308,1308,Garbitsch.
1309,1309,See about the photography.
1310,1310,When Their Excellencies meet...
1311,1311,tell the press to see that our Phooey is wellphotographed.
1312,1312," Full face, not the back of his head."
1313,1313," Yes, sir."
1314,1314,Benzino Napaloni's private train is now coming into the station.
1315,1315,And from a pink and white car...
1316,1316, Napaloni and his wife will step onto a crimson carpet...
1317,1317, Present arms!
1318,1318,where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome.
1319,1319,What's the matter with this stupid  Hey! What's all of this mixup ?
1320,1320,Come on. They've gone too far.
1321,1321,At ease! Bring along the carpet.
1322,1322,"Papa, why can't we get out here?"
1323,1323, There is no carpet.
1324,1324, Who cares about a carpet?
1325,1325,"Il DigaDitchy, me, Napaloni."
1326,1326,I never get out without a carpet.
1327,1327,Come on.
1328,1328,Lay it down here. Quick.
1329,1329, Hurry up!
1330,1330, It's going back again!
1331,1331,What?
1332,1332,What do you do? You salami?
1333,1333,Let's get out!
1334,1334,Let's get out while it's stopping!
1335,1335,Shut up!
1336,1336,Hurry. Quick. Put it down.
1337,1337,Take it away. Take it away.
1338,1338,Stay here. Stay here until they've made up their mind.
1339,1339,You got the carpet?
1340,1340,"Well, put 'em down!"
1341,1341,"Hmm. Oh, come on, come on."
1342,1342,Here he is.
1343,1343, My friend!
1344,1344, Napaloni!
1345,1345, This is indeed a pleasure.
1346,1346, Thank you.
1347,1347,Welcome to Tomainia. This way.
1348,1348,"Pictures, Your Excellencies?"
1349,1349,"Oh, sure. Salute!"
1350,1350,"Another one, please."
1351,1351,"Ah, this is really a pleasure to be here, my friend Hynkel."
1352,1352,"Oh, you want another picture?"
1353,1353,Just a moment.
1354,1354,There.
1355,1355," Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
1356,1356, My bambino!
1357,1357," All right. It's all right, Mama."
1358,1358, Get rid of those men.
1359,1359, Where is my ambassador?
1360,1360, Dismissed.
1361,1361," There you are. Hello, Spook."
1362,1362, Your Excellency.
1363,1363,How do you feel?
1364,1364,Good! Look after Mama.
1365,1365,"Oh, Hynkie, did you meet my wife?"
1366,1366, Your wife?
1367,1367, That's her.
1368,1368, I   Let's go.
1369,1369,Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.
1370,1370,Present... arms!
1371,1371,Napaloni! Napaloni!
1372,1372,Clock is two minutes slow.
1373,1373,This way.
1374,1374,Napaloni! Napaloni!
1375,1375,Napaloni!
1376,1376,It's very nice people.
1377,1377," I say, the people are very nice."
1378,1378," Oh, yes. Thank you."
1379,1379, He is my husband!
1380,1380, Keep back!
1381,1381, You make a mistake!
1382,1382, Let me go!
1383,1383, You make a big mistake!
1384,1384, Get back!
1385,1385,Please!
1386,1386,"At all costs, Napaloni shall not invade Osterlich."
1387,1387,That country belongs to me.
1388,1388,At this meeting we shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
1389,1389,This interview is solely to impress upon him the force of your personality.
1390,1390, Hmm.
1391,1391, To make him feel your superiority.
1392,1392,"This man Napaloni is aggressive, domineering."
1393,1393,"Before we make our demands, we must put him in his place."
1394,1394, Precisely. But how?
1395,1395, By means of applied psychology.
1396,1396,"In other words, by making him feel inferior."
1397,1397,This can be done in many subtle ways.
1398,1398,"For instance, at this interview, I have so arranged..."
1399,1399,that he will always be looking up at you...
1400,1400,you looking down at him.
1401,1401,At all times his position will be inferior.
1402,1402,Mmm. Excellent.
1403,1403,"Then again, we shall seat him here beside your bust..."
1404,1404,"so that if you relax, that will always be glaring at him."
1405,1405,And?
1406,1406,Where is he now?
1407,1407,Resting.
1408,1408,"When he arrives, I have arranged..."
1409,1409,that he shall enter from the far end of the room.
1410,1410,Another psychological triumph.
1411,1411,He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire length of the floor toward you.
1412,1412,Very good.
1413,1413,Yes?
1414,1414,His Excellency Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.
1415,1415,He's coming! He's coming!
1416,1416,"Quick, get me a flower. A flower."
1417,1417,"Remember, at all times you must be above him, before him."
1418,1418,"Entering or leaving, you must be first."
1419,1419,"Hello, Hynkie!"
1420,1420,Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!
1421,1421,How you feel?
1422,1422,Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1423,1423,"Ah, my brother dictator!"
1424,1424,"You are a nice little man, Hynkie!"
1425,1425,I'm so glad to see you again.
1426,1426,And my friend the Garbitsch!
1427,1427,Hello!
1428,1428,"Ah, this is a lovely place."
1429,1429,I feel fine.
1430,1430,I just had a nice cold shower.
1431,1431,"And that bathtub  as soon as you get the plumbing fixed, it'll be in good shape."
1432,1432,"Your Excellency, won't you sit down."
1433,1433,"Oh, shoot, shoot."
1434,1434,"Well, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you  I must be growing."
1435,1435,Not sure why they gave me a baby stool.
1436,1436,This stool is not for me.
1437,1437,I like it better upstairs here.
1438,1438,"You know something, Garbitsch?"
1439,1439,This is a lovely country.
1440,1440,Very nice people.
1441,1441,I thought the public extremely enthusiastic on your arrival.
1442,1442,Sure. They like to see new faces.
1443,1443,I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.
1444,1444,What's that? What's that?
1445,1445,I'm sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the  at the rail  Madam Napaloni at the railway station.
1446,1446,"Oh, she's not used to public life."
1447,1447,She can't take it.
1448,1448,Match.
1449,1449,"Oh  I'm sorry. I'm  No, that's all right."
1450,1450,Don't apologize. I find one.
1451,1451,I am simply crazy about this palace.
1452,1452,Ivory and gold  that makes a lovely combination.
1453,1453,Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
1454,1454,"Say, tell me something, Garbitsch."
1455,1455,What's on the program?
1456,1456, There's the grand ball this evening.
1457,1457, Grand ball?
1458,1458,"The grand ball. And this afternoon, a review of the army."
1459,1459,Review of the army?
1460,1460,"Well, that won't take long."
1461,1461, I'm afraid it will.
1462,1462," Oh? So you got a big army, huh?"
1463,1463,Modesty forbids.
1464,1464,"Yes, seems I've heard something about it."
1465,1465,"If I'm gonna review the army, I think I'll get me a shave."
1466,1466, We have a barbershop in the palace.
1467,1467, Is that so?
1468,1468,"Hynkie, you look a little blue under the gills."
1469,1469, What do you say we take a shave together?
1470,1470, I should be delighted.
1471,1471, Good!
1472,1472, Very well. This way.
1473,1473,"Ah, this is the barbershop."
1474,1474,I can smell 'em.
1475,1475,"Ah, now this is sweet, very sweet."
1476,1476, Do you like it? It was the emperor's library.
1477,1477, Makes a good barbershop.
1478,1478, Too old fashioned. I want something modern.
1479,1479, Is that so?
1480,1480,"You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous."
1481,1481,I like something to look at.
1482,1482,So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling...
1483,1483,"so that when my head is turned this way, I shall have a view of the mountains."
1484,1484,"And when it's tipped this way, I shall have a view through the glass ceiling."
1485,1485, What's above the ceiling?
1486,1486, The ballroom.
1487,1487,Then in my summer palace I have a barbershop.
1488,1488,Is that so?
1489,1489,Yes.
1490,1490,That also has glass walls.
1491,1491,You don't tell me.
1492,1492,"Oh, yes."
1493,1493,With goldfish swimming inside.
1494,1494,Wait a minute.
1495,1495,Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
1496,1496, Mmhmm.
1497,1497, How do you feed 'em?
1498,1498,You can't. They're all dead.
1499,1499,That's why I'm building a new barbershop.
1500,1500, Very interesting. Very interesting.
1501,1501, Yes? Do you like it?
1502,1502,This is the Hynkel Stadium.
1503,1503,"Before a half million spectators, the greatest display of arms the world has ever known..."
1504,1504,marches by in review.
1505,1505,Our beloved Phooey and Il DigaDitchy are seated...
1506,1506,"in the reviewing stand, thrilled by this historic event."
1507,1507,What?
1508,1508,Nothing. I'm just chewing.
1509,1509," Ah, yes."
1510,1510, Would you care for some peanuts?
1511,1511, Thank you. I've had some.
1512,1512," Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook."
1513,1513,Now passing  Tomainia's heavy artillery.
1514,1514,It's all right.
1515,1515,I want to show you my new bombing planes.
1516,1516,I just called up a half hour ago to start 'em over.
1517,1517, Where are they coming from?
1518,1518, Aroma.
1519,1519,Aroma? That's 400 miles away.
1520,1520,That's right. They should be here now.
1521,1521,I don't know what's detaining them.
1522,1522,Now passing  Tomainia's light artillery.
1523,1523,Hmm. That's very light.
1524,1524,And here come the armored tanks...
1525,1525,the pride of Tomainia's army.
1526,1526,"The latest design, the last word in modern warfare."
1527,1527,Wait a minute.
1528,1528,Where's the propellers?
1529,1529, Propellers?
1530,1530, Sure. For going under the water.
1531,1531, Tanks that go under the water?
1532,1532, Submarine work!
1533,1533,You never heard of aeromarine tanks that go under the water and then fly upstairs?
1534,1534, What's that?
1535,1535, Tanks that go under the water and fly in the air.
1536,1536,"Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now."
1537,1537,We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
1538,1538,Flying dreadnoughts.
1539,1539, What's that?
1540,1540, My planes!
1541,1541,Now passing  Hynkel's flying division number 34.
1542,1542,Our planes!
1543,1543,You're right. They're yours.
1544,1544,"Ah, Garbitsch."
1545,1545,The invasion of Osterlich.
1546,1546,"It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border."
1547,1547,"To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting  duck shooting or something."
1548,1548,"At the appointed time, you will show up at the village of Pretzelberg..."
1549,1549,"meet the army, step into an automobile and cross over into Osterlich."
1550,1550,Herring and I will be waiting at the capital to receive you.
1551,1551,"First, Napaloni must remove his troops from the border."
1552,1552,That question will be decided tonight.
1553,1553,Where is Napaloni?
1554,1554,I'll see if I can find him.
1555,1555,In the meantime...
1556,1556,it might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
1557,1557,It'll carry weight.
1558,1558,You mean I will carry weight.
1559,1559,You find him. Let me know at once.
1560,1560, Madam Napaloni.
1561,1561, Your Excellency.
1562,1562,Why so triste?
1563,1563,'Cause I no speak.
1564,1564,No? May I have the pleasure of this dance?
1565,1565,"Oh, yes."
1566,1566,Allow me.
1567,1567,"Madam, your dancing was superb."
1568,1568,Excellent.
1569,1569,Very good.
1570,1570,Good.
1571,1571," Ah, my dear Adenoid!"
1572,1572, Benzino!
1573,1573,I've been looking for you all evening.
1574,1574,What do you say we have a sandwich...
1575,1575,"go to some quiet little place where we can sit down and talk things over, huh?"
1576,1576, As you wish.
1577,1577," An excellent idea! Gentlemen, to the buffet."
1578,1578,Of course. This way.
1579,1579,There's an old Tomainian proverb.
1580,1580,That's very funny! I wish I understand it.
1581,1581,"Now, about the border situation."
1582,1582," Ah, yes, yes. No problem."
1583,1583," Oh, it should be no trouble at all."
1584,1584," Shh, shh."
1585,1585, Not at all.
1586,1586, What's the matter?
1587,1587, Wait.
1588,1588,Out!
1589,1589,"You two, out!"
1590,1590,Out.
1591,1591, Out?
1592,1592, Out.
1593,1593,Out?
1594,1594,Out.
1595,1595,"As I was saying, about the border question."
1596,1596," Ah, yes, yes, yes."
1597,1597, Just a matter of detail. Mere formalities.
1598,1598,Strawberries.
1599,1599,Pardon me.
1600,1600,Have you English mustard?
1601,1601," English mustard, Your Excellency."
1602,1602, That's the hot stuff?
1603,1603, Very hot.
1604,1604," Ah, good shape, good shape."
1605,1605, Cream.
1606,1606," Cream, Your Excellency."
1607,1607,"Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned, I'm gonna make this very simple."
1608,1608,This is the treaty  You agree not to invade Osterlich...
1609,1609,I agree not to invade Osterlich.
1610,1610,"We sign the treaty, then I remove my troops from the border."
1611,1611,"Good. In other words, when your troops are off the border, I sign."
1612,1612, That's right.
1613,1613, Very good.
1614,1614,"Oh, just a minute."
1615,1615,You don't understand.
1616,1616,"First we sign the treaty, then I remove the troops."
1617,1617,Precisely. I sign when your troops are off the border.
1618,1618,Just a minute.
1619,1619,"Hey, Spook, treaty."
1620,1620,Hold this.
1621,1621,"Now, look."
1622,1622,You sign this treaty first...
1623,1623,then I remove the troops after.
1624,1624," Well, what are we arguing about?"
1625,1625, You just said I remove the troops first.
1626,1626,You don't expect me to sign while your troops are there on the border?
1627,1627,You don't expect me to remove the troops until you sign?
1628,1628, Why not?
1629,1629, Why should I?
1630,1630, Why shouldn't you? Osterlich is a free country.
1631,1631, So?
1632,1632,"Your soldiers are there, on the Osterlich border!"
1633,1633,And they'll stay there until you sign this treaty!
1634,1634,"You'll take them off, or I'll blow them off!"
1635,1635,"Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere."
1636,1636,"Your Excellency, to quote an old Latin phrase  He's right! Speak to him!"
1637,1637,Strawberries.
1638,1638,Where's my sandwich?
1639,1639,"Well, give me another one!"
1640,1640, Can't we sit down and discuss this   I'm a guest here.
1641,1641,Nobody talk to me in my own joint like that!
1642,1642,Can't we sit down and discuss this thing without passion?
1643,1643,I am not passionate.
1644,1644,"I am just, that's all."
1645,1645,I want him to sign the treaty.
1646,1646,I'll remove the troops.
1647,1647,Can't you understand?
1648,1648,What would my people think...
1649,1649,signing such a treaty when your soldiers are there on the Osterlich border?
1650,1650,I will not move soldiers until you sign!
1651,1651,Not until you clear that border will I sign anything.
1652,1652, Then my soldiers remain!
1653,1653, Then I kick them off!
1654,1654,"One move from you, Hynkie, and my artillery take like this and blow you to pieces!"
1655,1655,"Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!"
1656,1656,You want to start a world war?
1657,1657,I'll get you one!
1658,1658,You and the world!
1659,1659,I'll throw in the ocean!
1660,1660, Mmm!
1661,1661," Gentlemen, please!"
1662,1662,I'm coming home!
1663,1663,I cannot talk to this ignoramus!
1664,1664,Strawberries!
1665,1665,"Your Excellency, we have a very important position..."
1666,1666,that I must urge upon you.
1667,1667,I know what you must  If you would  What's wrong?
1668,1668,I don't give a hoopy!
1669,1669,I got my guns here in the pass!
1670,1670,"If he start something, I'll blow him to ""passes!"" Excellency, what's the matter?"
1671,1671,"What ails you? What has   Your Excellency, this isn't like you."
1672,1672, Hey! What is the matter?
1673,1673,"Hey, Garbitsch, come here!"
1674,1674,What is the matter with Hynkie?
1675,1675,He's put mustard on his strawberries.
1676,1676,Mustard  What else can you expect from Hynkie?
1677,1677,Il DigaDitchy!
1678,1678,What? What's the matter? What?
1679,1679,My little bambino!
1680,1680,...the Bacterian  ... Tomainia  You cannot treat the Bacterian people this way!
1681,1681,I'll take the Bacterian people and I'll tear them apart like this!
1682,1682," Excellency, please!"
1683,1683, Look! Look what he's doing!
1684,1684,It's an insult to my people!
1685,1685,"Look, he's pulling spaghetti!"
1686,1686,The spaghetti!
1687,1687,"He either sign the treaty, or we have a war!"
1688,1688, Ooh!
1689,1689, Listen! Listen!
1690,1690,Give me something! Quick!
1691,1691,Give me something! I want to   But it's all right. I have an appointment.
1692,1692, What's this?
1693,1693,I'm from the international press.
1694,1694,How's the conference progressing?
1695,1695,Very successfully. How did you get in?
1696,1696,"Excuse me, will you?"
1697,1697,How did this man get in here?
1698,1698,You know the regulations of the palace in regard to reporters. Go down to Captain Block.
1699,1699,Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter the palace under any circumstances tonight.
1700,1700, You understand?
1701,1701," Yes, sir."
1702,1702,"Of course, there are minor details to be cleaned up, things that you must  Excuse me. We're very busy."
1703,1703, Oh!
1704,1704," Gentlemen, please!"
1705,1705,The press are outside. The whole world will know that we're fighting.
1706,1706, So what?
1707,1707, Can't we come to some agreement?
1708,1708, Not until he signs!
1709,1709, I sign nothing!
1710,1710,"Your Excellency, I must speak to you alone."
1711,1711, Do you mind?
1712,1712, Mind? I don't mind!
1713,1713, What is it?
1714,1714, Sign. Sign.
1715,1715,Why should he have the advantage?
1716,1716,"What does it matter, a mere scrap of paper?"
1717,1717,"The moment you sign, he'll take his troops off the border."
1718,1718,We can move in without losing a man.
1719,1719,I'll sign.
1720,1720,What?
1721,1721,Hold this!
1722,1722,"Ah, my little Hynkie!"
1723,1723,My dictator brother!
1724,1724,I knew we have no trouble!
1725,1725,Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms!
1726,1726,Officers tied up in the guard room!
1727,1727,Sound the alarm!
1728,1728,Two prisoners escaped! Come on!
1729,1729,The planes are searching for us.
1730,1730,Let's make for the woods.
1731,1731,No. We must keep in the open.
1732,1732,The border's that way.
1733,1733,The invasion of Osterlich.
1734,1734,Now... or never.
1735,1735,Ducks!
1736,1736,Did you hear that?
1737,1737,Came from over there. Come on.
1738,1738,Da Blitzen!
1739,1739,Cheese and crackers!
1740,1740,...da Blitzen!
1741,1741,"A yodeler, huh?"
1742,1742,Where'd you get that outfit?
1743,1743, What?
1744,1744, Don't answer back!
1745,1745,Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
1746,1746,"You won't talk, huh?"
1747,1747, He'll talk when he gets into camp!
1748,1748, Come on!
1749,1749,There it is  the village of Pretzelberg.
1750,1750,Pretzelberg.
1751,1751,"If we can pass through there, we're safe across the Osterlich border."
1752,1752, Couldn't we go through the woods?
1753,1753, Of course not.
1754,1754,The woods are swarming with soldiers.
1755,1755,They'd suspect us at once.
1756,1756,We must face the music.
1757,1757,"If you see anyone, don't look right or left."
1758,1758,We must bluff our way through.
1759,1759,"Remember, you're a storm trooper."
1760,1760,Here they come.
1761,1761,Can you see what they're doing?
1762,1762, They're looking this way.
1763,1763," Well, pay no attention. Keep going."
1764,1764,They're beginning to follow us.
1765,1765,Shall we run?
1766,1766,Certainly not.
1767,1767, Just a little bit?
1768,1768, Keep walking.
1769,1769,We could walk a little faster.
1770,1770,Hmm? Make up your mind.
1771,1771, Perhaps we'd better slow down.
1772,1772," No, no. Keep going."
1773,1773, There's no hurry.
1774,1774, Come on.
1775,1775, What is it?
1776,1776, He's here!
1777,1777,What? Bugler! Sound assembly!
1778,1778,Company! Attention!
1779,1779,Present... arms!
1780,1780, You don't want to change your mind and turn back?
1781,1781," No, keep going. Keep going."
1782,1782, Hail Hynkel.
1783,1783, Order... arms!
1784,1784,Your Excellency will be pleased to know that everything is under control.
1785,1785, Good.
1786,1786, Good.
1787,1787,"I have been in continued communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir."
1788,1788,The route ahead of us is wellguarded.
1789,1789,"And at the back of us are 200 tanks,  Is that   Good."
1790,1790, Good.
1791,1791, Are we ready to start?
1792,1792, Yes.
1793,1793, Yes.
1794,1794,Gentlemen.
1795,1795,"Schultz, I'm certainly happy to see you with us again."
1796,1796,Thank you.
1797,1797, Where are we going?
1798,1798, You're invading Osterlich.
1799,1799,Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!
1800,1800, Hannah!
1801,1801," Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!"
1802,1802,Present... arms!
1803,1803,Hail Hynkel!
1804,1804,Hail Hynkel!
1805,1805,Present... arms!
1806,1806,"Your Excellency, the world awaits your word."
1807,1807,What's happened to him?
1808,1808,He looks strange.
1809,1809,And what's Schultz doing here?
1810,1810,"Pardoned, I suppose."
1811,1811,Here.
1812,1812,"His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch..."
1813,1813,"Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda."
1814,1814,"""Corona veniet delectis. "" ""Victory shall come to the worthy. "" Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people."
1815,1815,No nation can progress with such ideas.
1816,1816,They stand in the way of action.
1817,1817,"Therefore, we frankly abolish them."
1818,1818,"In the future, each man will serve the interest of the state with absolute obedience."
1819,1819,Let him who refuses beware.
1820,1820,The rights of citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and other nonAryans.
1821,1821,"They are inferior, and therefore enemies of the state."
1822,1822,It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
1823,1823,"Henceforth, this nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire..."
1824,1824,and the people of this nation will obey the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...
1825,1825,"the dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich..."
1826,1826,the future emperor of the world.
1827,1827,You must speak.
1828,1828,I can't.
1829,1829,You must. It's our only hope.
1830,1830,Hope.
1831,1831,I'm sorry...
1832,1832,but I don't want to be an emperor.
1833,1833,That's not my business.
1834,1834,I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
1835,1835,"I should like to help everyone, if possible  Jew, gentile, black man, white."
1836,1836,We all want to help one another.
1837,1837,Human beings are like that.
1838,1838,"We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery."
1839,1839,We don't want to hate and despise one another.
1840,1840,"In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich..."
1841,1841,and can provide for everyone.
1842,1842,The way of life can be free and beautiful.
1843,1843,But we have lost the way.
1844,1844,Greed has poisoned men's souls...
1845,1845,has barricaded the world with hate...
1846,1846,has goosestepped us into misery and bloodshed.
1847,1847,"We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in."
1848,1848,Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
1849,1849,"Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind."
1850,1850,We think too much and feel too little.
1851,1851,"More than machinery, we need humanity."
1852,1852,"More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness."
1853,1853,"Without these qualities, life will be violent, and all will be lost."
1854,1854,The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
1855,1855,These very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men...
1856,1856,"cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all."
1857,1857,"Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world..."
1858,1858,"millions of despairing men, women and little children..."
1859,1859,victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
1860,1860,"To those who can hear me I say, do not despair."
1861,1861,The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed...
1862,1862,the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
1863,1863,"The hate of men will pass, and dictators die..."
1864,1864,and the power they took from the people will return to the people.
1865,1865,"And so long as men die, liberty will never perish."
1866,1866,"Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes..."
1867,1867,"men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives..."
1868,1868,"tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel..."
1869,1869,"who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!"
1870,1870,Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men  machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
1871,1871,You are not machines!
1872,1872,You are not cattle! You are men!
1873,1873,You have the love of humanity in your hearts.
1874,1874,You don't hate.
1875,1875,Only the unloved hate.
1876,1876,The unloved and the unnatural.
1877,1877,"Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!"
1878,1878,In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke it is written...
1879,1879,"""The kingdom of God is within man. "" Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men  in you!"
1880,1880,"You the people have the power  the power to create machines, the power to create happiness!"
1881,1881,You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful...
1882,1882,to make this life a wonderful adventure.
1883,1883,"Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power!"
1884,1884,Let us all unite!
1885,1885,"Let us fight for a new world, a decent world..."
1886,1886,that will give men a chance to work...
1887,1887,that will give youth a future and old age a security.
1888,1888,"By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power."
1889,1889,But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
1890,1890,They never will!
1891,1891,"Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people."
1892,1892,Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!
1893,1893,Let us fight to free the world...
1894,1894,"to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed..."
1895,1895,with hate and intolerance.
1896,1896,"Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress..."
1897,1897,will lead to all men's happiness.
1898,1898,"Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"
1899,1899,Hannah...
1900,1900,can you hear me?
1901,1901,"Wherever you are, look up, Hannah."
1902,1902,The clouds are lifting.
1903,1903,The sun is breaking through.
1904,1904,We are coming out of the darkness and into the light.
1905,1905,"We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world..."
1906,1906,where men will rise above their hate...
1907,1907,their greed and brutality.
1908,1908,"Look up, Hannah."
1909,1909,The soul of man has been given wings...
1910,1910,and at last he is beginning to fly.
1911,1911,He is flying into the rainbow...
1912,1912,"into the light of hope, into the future  the glorious future..."
1913,1913,"that belongs to you, to me..."
1914,1914,and to all of us.
1915,1915,"Look up, Hannah. Look up."
1916,1916,"Hannah, did you hear that?"
1917,1917,Listen.
