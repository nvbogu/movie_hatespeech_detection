621,621,">> WELL, HONESTLY, IT..."
622,622,IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE.
623,623,IT'S MORE ABOUT JUST COMBINING OUR RESOURCES TO GO AFTER THE BIGGER JOBS.
624,624,>> GREENPOINT'S BEEN A THORN IN YOUR ASS FROM DAY ONE.
625,625,>> IT WOULD DOUBLE OUR REVENUE AND ALLOW US TO COMPETE FOR PROJECTS THAT WE REALLY WOULD NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO.

701,701,ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO JOSH TAKES ME TO SEE WYNTON MARSALIS AT LINCOLN CENTER.
702,702,HE WAS COMPLETELY BROKE BUT HE SPRINGS FOR THESE TICKETS ANYWAY... MAKES ME PROMISE TO BE THERE AT EIGHT P.M. RIGHT ON THE DOT.
703,703,">> OH, GOD, NO, DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE LATE?"
704,704,">> NO, NO, NO, I WAS ON TIME, BUT I WAS EXHAUSTED."
705,705,"AND I SETTLE INTO ONE OF THOSE BIG, COMFY LINCOLN CENTER CHAIRS AND FALL SOUND ASLEEP."
706,706,">> KIT WOULD KILL ME IF I FELL ASLEEP LISTENING TO AN ALBUM, MUCH LESS A LIVE PERFORMANCE."
707,707,">> YEAH, I KNOW."
708,708,"WELL, I, YOU KNOW, I, I WOKE UP AFTER PROBABLY AN HOUR OR SO INTO IT, IN A STATE OF COMPLETE PANIC, AND I LOOK OVER AT JOSH AND HE'S TOTALLY ENGROSSED IN THE MUSIC, YOU KNOW, THAT SPATIAL COCOON SORT OF THING, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN NOTICE."
709,709,"WHEN I GET HOME, I REACH TO TAKE MY TIE OFF AND I REALIZED THAT HALF OF IT IS GONE."
710,710,THAT SON OF A BITCH HAD CUT THE TIE FROM THE NUB DOWN.
711,711,>> NO!
712,712,>> HE LEFT ME WITH A NUB!
713,713,"YEAH, WHEN I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HE TAKES OUT HIS LITTLE SWISS ARMY KNIFE AND JUST HACKS OFF HALF MY TIE... RIDICULOUS."
714,714,HE SAID IF I EVER DID IT AGAIN HE'S GONNA SLICE A LITTLE HIGHER.

724,724,"YOU KNOW, I NEVER WOULD'VE ADMITTED IT THEN, BUT I WAS SO TERRIFIED OF THE CITY."
725,725,BUT I ALSO KNEW I WAS IN LOVE WITH IT TOO.
726,726,>> WHY WOULDN'T YOU ADMIT TO BE TERRIFIED BY IT?
727,727,>> I DON'T KNOW.
728,728,">> IT'S FUNNY, FROM THE TIME WE'RE KIDS WE'RE TAUGHT NOT TO BE AFRAID."
729,729,IT'S THE ONE THING WE ALL PRETEND NOT TO BE AND PROBABLY PRETEND NOT TO BE AND PROBABLY THE ONLY THING WE ALL ARE.
730,730,THE ONLY THING WE ALL ARE.
