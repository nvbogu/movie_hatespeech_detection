462,462, Remember that.
463,463," Yes, sir."
464,464,I quit the team.
465,465,That was a mistake.
466,466,I can't do it anymore.
467,467,You're reminding me of your mother.
468,468,"I guess that's bad, right?"
469,469,Your mother wasn't shit.
470,470,That woman failed me.
471,471,I got more pussy after she killed herself...
472,472,than I did when she was living as my wife.
473,473,The point is...
474,474,she quit on me.
475,475,You're doing the same.
476,476,Goddamnit!
477,477,Let's go.
478,478,Hand me my purse.
479,479,Come on. Get out!
480,480," Why, Mama, what's wrong?"
481,481, We've got to walk.
482,482,"Tyrell, get off that street!"
483,483,You'll get yourself killed.
484,484,Don't do that!
485,485,Don't do that!
486,486,This is jimdandy.
487,487,This is just what I'm looking for.
488,488,"At the same time, it's the most expensive one."
489,489,But if you're willing to talk price a little...
490,490,We put quite a bit of work into it.
491,491,We could talk about it.
492,492,Let me think it over.
493,493,You have my number.
494,494, All right.
495,495, It was a pleasure.
496,496, Nice seeing you.

525,525,We need to get him to the hospital.
526,526,Right now! Right now!
527,527,We'll need a gurney out here.
528,528,There's a kid. I think it's bad.
529,529,We'll need some help.
530,530,Are you the boy's mother?
531,531,"Please, follow me."
532,532,Is that your boy?
533,533,No.
534,534,What happened?
535,535,I think he got hit by a car.
536,536,That was his mother.
537,537, She said he was hit by a car.
538,538, Hit and run?
539,539,I don't know.
540,540,I picked them up I need you to file a police report if it was a hit and run.
541,541,"Shit, I don't even know them."
542,542,I wouldn't know what to write.
543,543,"Just stay, tell the police what you did and saw."
544,544,It'll be five minutes.
545,545,Wait!
546,546,Wait!
547,547,That's my baby!
548,548,Wait!
549,549,That's my baby!
550,550,That's my baby!
551,551,"I know you're not supposed to move people, but I didn't know what else to do."
552,552,The boy was laying there...
553,553,and the woman was hysterical.
554,554,I did the best I could do.
555,555,I just lugged him in the car to come here as quick as I could.
556,556,That's what I did.
557,557,You did a good job.
558,558,So you were just passing by?
559,559,"Yeah, I don't know the lady at all."
560,560,I'll give you my card.
561,561,We'll do a followup if we get anything.
562,562,"We might call you as well, if we need to."
563,563, That'd be all right?
564,564, Whatever you need me to do.
565,565,I got your number right there.
566,566,Is that it?
567,567,Can I go?
568,568,Yeah. Thanks.
569,569,Will that boy make it all right?
570,570,"No, he died."
571,571,"Mrs. Musgrove, I'll give you my card and you feel free to call me anytime that you can remember anything about this."
572,572,I'm so sorry.
573,573,Can I get something to clean that off?
574,574,That's mine.
575,575, Here's your purse.

583,583, That's a good idea.
584,584,"Yeah, I'll take her home."
585,585,Could you do me a favor and throw that away for me?
586,586," Yes, sir."
587,587, I'd appreciate that.
588,588,Where do you live?
589,589,"Ma'am, you'll have to tell me where you live."
590,590,"Now, I'll go in your purse."
591,591,I'm letting you know I'm going in your purse to find an address on you.
592,592,You should call some of your kin people or a friend or something.

597,597,They told me to call the Coroner's Office.
598,598,They said they gonna do an autopsy.
599,599,I don't know why they'll do an autopsy.
600,600,He was hit by a car.
601,601,I imagine that'll help them find out who did it.
602,602,You really believe they'll do that?
603,603,I believe they'll try their best.
604,604,He's a Black kid.
605,605,You think they'll do that?
606,606,Here's your bag.

643,643,I didn't buy it.
644,644," Yeah, well..."
645,645, I wouldn't have bought no gas station.
646,646,Is that right?
647,647,I would have stuck to what I knew best.
648,648, What's that?
649,649, Corrections Officer.
650,650,Right.
651,651,"Well, I ain't a Corrections Officer no more."

694,694,My son died.
695,695,"And well, he he died and then I never was a very good father."
696,696,He was a good kid.
697,697,I guess that somehow I just when I see what you're going through there it made me think about something.
698,698,I don't know.
699,699,You know when you feel like you can't breathe?
700,700,"And you can't get out to from inside yourself, you know?"
701,701,Really.
702,702,Do you want to come inside?
703,703,I like these curtains.
704,704,I got these here curtains on credit.

737,737,Didn't he?
738,738,"That's the only thing that negro ever gave that boy, was some drawing."
739,739,Taught him how to draw.

756,756,He had to wait till he get the red gumball.
757,757,He always had to get the red gumball.
758,758,"He sounds like a character, I guess."
