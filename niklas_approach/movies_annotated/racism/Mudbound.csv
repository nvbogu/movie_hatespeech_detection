0,0,We ain't gonna make it.
1,1,"Oh, we will. We have to."
2,2,Take a break. Come on.
3,3,My turn.
4,4,"""We will. We have to."" That was my brother, Henry."
5,5,Absolutely certain whatever he wanted to happen would.
6,6,The weather would dry out in time to resow the cotton.
7,7,We would get this hole dug before the storm hit.
8,8,God damn it!
9,9, Jesus Christ!
10,10, What is it?
11,11,It's a slave's grave.
12,12,How do you know that?
13,13,Shot in the head.
14,14,Must've been a runaway.
15,15,"Well, that settles it."
16,16,Settles what?
17,17,I ain't burying my father in no slave's grave.
18,18,Nothing he would've hated more.
19,19,Help me up.
20,20,We ain't got a choice.
21,21,"That's it, brother! Come on!"
22,22, Huh?
23,23, That's it!
24,24,Get you out of there!
25,25,Come on!
26,26,Come on.
27,27,God damn it!
28,28," Come on, Jamie. Hang on!"
29,29, No.
30,30,I'm gonna fetch a ladder!
31,31,Huh?
32,32,Henry!
33,33,Henry!
34,34,Henry!
35,35,Henry!
36,36," Henry, where are you?"
37,37, Right here! I'm here!
38,38,That was my brother Henry.
39,39,Absolutely certain whatever he wanted to happen would.
40,40,And his little brother...
41,41,Jamie.
42,42,...would never betray him.
43,43,Come on. Come here. Come on.
44,44,What's the matter with you? Huh?
45,45,I thought you were...
46,46,gonna leave me down there!
47,47,Come on. Why would I do that?
48,48,Why would I do that?
49,49,"When I think of the farm, I think of mud."
50,50,Encrusting knees and hair.
51,51,Marching in bootshaped patches across the floor.
52,52,I dreamed in brown.
53,53,"All right. Come on, lift it up."
54,54, Come on.
55,55," You know, just get... Come on!"
56,56, Hang on. Just let it... Hang on.
57,57, Hold on.
58,58," Lift it, Jamie. Lift it."
59,59, Just get a little more...
60,60,"Just stop, okay? Let's set it down."
61,61,Why don't we just run the ropes lengthwise? We stand at either end.
62,62,"No, the coffin's too narrow."
63,63,"If it falls again, it might break."
64,64," Well, we can try."
65,65, No!
66,66, Hap!
67,67, Henry.
68,68, Hap!
69,69," Henry, don't."
70,70, It ain't my fault what happened.
71,71, Whoa.
72,72, I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
73,73, Just let 'em go.
74,74,Hap!
75,75,"Hap, can you hold on?"
76,76,"Can you lend us a hand, Hap?"
77,77,Need to get that coffin in the ground.
78,78,Hap?
79,79,I was a 31yearold virgin when I met Henry McAllan in the spring of 1939.
80,80,I lived with my parents in the house I grew up in.
81,81,"My world was small, and he was my rescuer from a life in the margins."
82,82,"Oh, really? He tells me that, uh, you are actually a college man."
83,83,Engineering.
84,84, An engineering degree from Ole Miss.
85,85, Yes.
86,86,"Did you hear that, Laura?"
87,87,An engineering degree from Ole Miss.
88,88,"My, my, my."
89,89,"You know, Laura is a college graduate."
90,90,She got her teaching certificate from West Tennessee State. We're very proud.
91,91,Mmhmm. My dear sister's the smartest one in the family.
92,92,Made better grades than I ever did.
93,93,Never heard the end of it.
94,94,She is smart.
95,95,"Laura, you should, uh, play the piano for us after dinner."
96,96,Hmm?
97,97,You should hear her sing.
98,98,She sings like an angel.
99,99,"Yeah, you should play something for Mr. McAllan later."
100,100, Mama. Mama.
101,101," ""Ave Maria."" That's my favorite."
102,102, You will love that. It's so beautiful.
103,103, Mama.
104,104,What?
105,105,"I'm quite sure that Teddy did not bring his new boss, Mr. McAllan, over to hear hymns."
106,106,"Well, why don't we just ask him."
107,107, Mr. McAllan?
108,108, Mmhmm?
109,109,Would you like to hear some music after dinner?
110,110,I like hymns.
111,111,He likes hymns.
112,112,I was unused to male admiration and knew only that I wanted more.
113,113,It was at least a reprieve from the sincere pity and insincere kindness directed at old maids.
114,114, Right.
115,115, So...
116,116,He didn't feel the need to fill the air with words like I did.
117,117,He had the selfconfidence I lacked.
118,118, That's it?
119,119, Uhhuh.
120,120,Well...
121,121,I can't say I was truly in love with him then...
122,122,"but I was so grateful to him, it dwarfed everything else."
123,123,My brother Jamie's coming up from Oxford next weekend.
124,124,I'd like for him to meet you.
125,125,"There he is, right there."
126,126,Brother! Brother!
127,127," You look good, brother."
128,128, Likewise.
129,129,The air up here in Memphis agrees with you.
130,130,Or is it something else?
131,131,"Miss Chappell, this here is my brother, Jamie."
132,132, Pleased to meet you.
133,133, Pleasure's all mine.
134,134,"Oh, he thinks he's one of them characters in his plays."
135,135,"Yes, but which play is it, dear brother?"
136,136,Hamlet? Faust? Prince Hal?
137,137,One of them fellas that could earn you a decent wage someday.
138,138,"What do you think, Miss Chappell?"
139,139,I think you're more of a Puck.
140,140, Who's Puck?
141,141," ""Lord, what fools these mortals be."" Puck's a kind of mischievous sprite."
142,142,He's a hobgoblin.
143,143,"Forgive me, brother."
144,144,I'm only trying to impress her.
145,145,"Oh, you'll find Miss Laura is not the impressionable type."
146,146, Shall we?
147,147, We shall.
148,148,I went ahead and told Pappy you were here today.
149,149,Uhhuh.
150,150,I wanna hear. I wanna hear.
151,151,"Next thing I knew, I was sucked under, concussed and bleeding, and I was as good as gone, another victim of the Great Flood of '27."
152,152, I can't believe you never told me this.
153,153, There's more.
154,154,Then what happened?
155,155,"Well, I saw a shimmering light,  like a falling star."
156,156," ""Shimmering."" And a great big hand reached out of it and I thought it was God himself come to take me."
157,157,But it wasn't.
158,158,"It was my dear big brother, Henry."
159,159, You saved his life. You're a hero.
160,160," Indeed, he is."
161,161,"Well, what was I supposed to do, huh?"
162,162,Let him drown?
163,163,"Here's to the future, whatever it may hold."
164,164,"May you be blessed with happiness, health, prosperity, and if she'll have you, a house full of children."
165,165,My love to you both.
166,166,Bubbly.
167,167,Would you mind terribly if I had a dance with your girl?
168,168,"Miss Chappell, care to take a spin?"
169,169,I'd be delighted.
170,170,Jamie saw in a different way.
171,171,"And when his eyes were on me, I felt like I was no longer invisible."
172,172,"Thanks a lot, guys."
173,173, I'll be back.
174,174, Absolutely.
175,175,You look especially pretty tonight.
176,176,Thank you.
177,177,Jamie has that effect on girls.
178,178,They sparkle for him.
179,179,He likes you. I can tell.
180,180,I'm sure he doesn't dislike anyone.
181,181,"Well, at least not anyone in a skirt, anyways."
182,182,Henry's marriage proposal didn't play out like I pictured it would.
183,183,He wasn't kneeling and the question came out as more of a statement.
184,184,Henry wasn't a romantic.
185,185,He was made of sturdier stuff.
186,186, Yeah?
187,187, Yeah.
188,188,I loved domestic life.
189,189,Yielding to Henry and waiting for him to come home to me was what I'd been put on Earth to do.
190,190,"And when Amanda Leigh was born, I became hers completely."
191,191,Then came the day that changed everything.
192,192,Forever.
193,193,"December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy."
194,194,The United States of America...
195,195,was suddenly and deliberately attacked...
196,196,by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
197,197,"The United States was at peace with that nation, and at the solicitation of Japan..."
198,198,Daddy borrowed Mr. Robert and 'nem truck to take me.
199,199,That's what I remember most.
200,200,The first things and the last things...
201,201,they always stick the hardest.
202,202,Thank you.
203,203,We'll be praying for you.
204,204,All right.
205,205,Don't forget about us.
206,206,"Oh, I won't."
207,207,I won't. Okay?
208,208,You take care.
209,209,I will.
210,210,"Y'all pitch in good around here, yeah?"
211,211,"Help your mother, now."
212,212, All right?
213,213, We will.
214,214,Keep them no 'count boys off Lilly May.
215,215,Don't let her get old so fast.
216,216, You just come back.
217,217, I will.
218,218,You come all the way back. You hear?
219,219," I love you, Mama."
220,220," I love you, too, baby."
221,221,Thank you.
222,222,I can't look back.
223,223,I didn't look back.
224,224,They say it's bad luck to watch somebody leave.
225,225,I held his heartbeat in my hand.
226,226,I remember every beat.
227,227,He was warm and alive.
228,228,I know every place in him...
229,229,and it was all I could do to not look back.
230,230,"No, I don't have favorites."
231,231,I love them all equally.
232,232,Every mother does.
233,233,But during all those four years...
234,234,all that time he was gone...
235,235,I only prayed for him.
236,236,God will forgive me.
237,237,"Come on, now."
238,238,Dig that hole in there.
239,239,"Come on, Ruel. Let's go. Come on."
240,240,Keep going.
241,241,Supper's gonna be ready when we get in.
242,242,What good is a deed?
243,243,"My grandfathers and great uncles, grandmothers and great aunts, father and mother, broke, tilled, thawed, planted, plucked, raised, burned, broke again."
244,244,"Worked this land all their life, this land that never would be theirs."
245,245,They worked until they sweated.
246,246,They sweated until they bled.
247,247,They bled until they died.
248,248,Died with the dirt of this same 200 acres under their fingernails.
249,249,"Died clawing at the hard, brown back that would never be theirs."
250,250,All their deeds undone.
251,251,"Yet this man, this place, this law..."
252,252,say you need a deed. Not deeds.
253,253,Calvin Augustus got his land here...
254,254,and then Bud Leo bought land here.
255,255,Now I figure there's a couple acres right here.
256,256,If only fences can be put up with lead.
257,257,They get taken down with lead all the time.
258,258,"Won't be too much longer, Papa, will it?"
259,259,"Around this time next year, I'm gonna have me about 50 acres of cotton, Fool, rice don't grow here."
260,260,Never call your brother a fool.
261,261,I'm gonna grow some anyway.
262,262,That's why I'm not gonna be no farmer.
263,263,I'm gonna be a stenographer.
264,264, A Ste... what?
265,265, It's kind of like a typist.
266,266, They don't allow no colored typists.
267,267, Your sister will be the first.
268,268,"Honey, by the way..."
269,269,I bought a farm in Mississippi.
270,270,And we'll be moving there in three weeks' time.
271,271,It's 40 miles south of Greenville.
272,272,Big old...
273,273,"porch, fig tree..."
274,274,Girls are gonna love the four bedrooms.
275,275,But we love this house.
276,276,But now they get their own room each and Pappy gets his own space.
277,277,Pappy?
278,278,"Honey, now Mama's gone, we gotta look after him."
279,279,We got 200 acres of fertile land.
280,280,Imagine that.
281,281, You're mighty quiet.
282,282, I'm mighty surprised.
283,283,You always knew I wanted my own farm someday.
284,284, No.
285,285, I told ya.
286,286,"Henry, I had no idea."
287,287, I'm...
288,288, I would have remembered that.
289,289,"Well, I'm telling you now."
290,290,You're gonna love it.
291,291,You will. Wait and see.
292,292,Hmm?
293,293,Honey.
294,294,Huh?
295,295, I like the porch a lot.
296,296, Yeah.
297,297,Huh?
298,298,Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?
299,299,"Come on, come on. Come on. You, too."
300,300,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
301,301,"You wait up there, huh?"
302,302,"You're gonna get the best room for yourself, huh?"
303,303,"Is that it, huh?"
304,304,Huh?
305,305,What's 'round the back over there?
306,306,There should be a key right under the mat.
307,307, Go on. Get it. Get it.
308,308, Who the hell are you?
309,309,We're the McAllans.
310,310,New tenants of this house. Who are you?
311,311,Orris Stokes.
312,312,I'm the new owner of this house.
313,313,"Well, I rented this place off of George Suddeth just three weeks ago."
314,314,Suddeth sold me this house last week.
315,315,He didn't say nothing about no renters.
316,316,"Well, looks like I'm gonna have to refresh his memory, huh?"
317,317, He left town three days ago.
318,318, I gave him a $100 deposit.
319,319, You get anything in writing?
320,320," No, Pappy, I shook on the deal."
321,321,"I gave him $100, cash, right there in the front room."
322,322,Had dinner with him and his wife. I did.
323,323,I showed him...
324,324, Y'all best be getting on.
325,325, I showed him pictures of my little...
326,326,"You got swindled, boy. Damn fool."
327,327,You damn fool.
328,328,Never thought a son of mine would be so damn stupid.
329,329,"Come on, we can stay on the farm."
330,330,There's a house there.
331,331,We're gonna stay on the farm.
332,332,We can make it work. Come on.
333,333,Out there with the niggers and the farmhands?
334,334,"There's no place in town big enough for all of us, Pappy."
335,335,"Believe me, I checked."
336,336,"Huh? Come on, sugar."
337,337,Honey! This is it!
338,338,"This is our land, honey!"
339,339,"One of my great uncles, Uncle Willie, got a hold of a piece of land down Reconstruction."
340,340,He had a deed.
341,341,"Four white men on horses rode up one day, aimed a pistol..."
342,342,said he was dead.
343,343,"My uncle's good deed, torn into 40 pieces and thrown to the wind."
344,344,"And so I ask, what good is a deed?"
345,345,"That mule made me a share tenant, not a sharecropper."
346,346,And had me dreaming about having my own piece of land.
347,347,Maybe that's where the problem started.
348,348,You'll be coming to us for all your food.
349,349,We're gonna be getting all your stenographer money.
350,350,Nuhuh.
351,351,"'Cause I'mma be in California or Chicago, where all the good colored jobs at."
352,352, War gonna be over by then.
353,353," No, it won't."
354,354, But Ronsel might be home early.
355,355, I don't want him home early.
356,356, Early means...
357,357, He ain't coming back early.
358,358,Y'all finish up.
359,359,Get these dishes rinsed off before bed.
360,360,Howdy.
361,361,"Evenin', mister."
362,362,McAllan. Henry... Henry McAllan.
363,363, You're Hap Jackson.
364,364," Yes, sir."
365,365,"My family and I, we just arrived."
366,366,I'll need your help to unload.
367,367, So you're the new owner?
368,368, I am.
369,369,Thought y'all weren't comin' until next week.
370,370,"Need to get unloaded, get a fire on before it gets dark."
371,371, Okay?
372,372," Yes, sir."
373,373,Evenin'.
374,374,Then tell him to walk.
375,375,"It's too far, and we don't have time."
376,376,It's getting late in the day.
377,377,I ain't movin' for no nigger.
378,378,He can't ride with Laura and the girls alone so...
379,379,There's no room in the back of truck.
380,380,"Pappy, please."
381,381,"Mr. McAllan was from Memphis, and my guess was he ain't know the eating end of a mule from the crappin' end."
382,382,Told me he intended to bring in one of them infernal tractors.
383,383,Imagine that.
384,384,Using a machine to work his land instead of the hands the Lord gave 'em.
385,385,Huh? Gonna do some fishin'.
386,386,"You all right, Mrs. McAllan?"
387,387,Fine. Thank you.
388,388,You better get him to fix them shutters or we're gonna freeze to death.
389,389,We gotta get that truck unloaded before that rain comes down.
390,390,Just leave it right here.
391,391,"You relax yourself there, Pappy."
392,392,We'll take it.
393,393,Girls are done in. I need their blankets.
394,394,All right.
395,395,There has to be some in here somewhere.
396,396,"All right, girls, come on."
397,397, Just stack 'em in the corner.
398,398," Yes, ma'am."
399,399,"""A Tale of Two Cities."
400,400,"Wuthering..."" You can read?"
401,401,My son Ronsel taught me.
402,402,He gonna be fightin' under General Patton.
403,403,You mean diggin' ditches and peelin' potatoes?
404,404,"No, sir, he a tank commander."
405,405,"Oh, there's no way the army's gonna turn a tank worth thousands of dollars over to a nigger."
406,406,"Now my son Jamie, now there's a fighting man."
407,407,He's flying bombers.
408,408,"Uh, my son's a sergeant. 761st Battalion."
409,409,Calls 'em the Black Panthers.
410,410,Hey.
411,411,Boy.
412,412,You know what they call a nigger with stripes?
413,413,A raccoon.
414,414,"Honey, where you wanna put this piano?"
415,415,Let me get the girls to bed first.
416,416,Ain't no room for that piano.
417,417,Where am I gonna sleep?
418,418,We'll have to put you in the leanto.
419,419,I ain't sleepin' out there.
420,420, It don't even have a floor.
421,421," Henry, please."
422,422, There's no room.
423,423," Get rid of that piano, we can put a bed right there."
424,424,Put a curtain around it.
425,425,"It's true, we could."
426,426,I don't want a bedroom in the living room.
427,427,She puttin' me out.
428,428, We're not puttin' you out.
429,429," Henry, may I speak to you in private?"
430,430, Honey! Not puttin' you out.
431,431, Henry.
432,432,"When you told me that you were bringin' me to this godforsaken place, I barely said a word."
433,433,"When you informed me he was comin' to live with us, I went along."
434,434,"And when Orris Stokes told you you'd been fleeced by that man you rented the house from, I kept my mouth shut."
435,435,"But I am tellin' you now, we are not gettin' rid of that piano."
436,436,It's the one civilized thing in this place.
437,437,"So your father can either sleep in the leanto or in the bed with you, because I'm not stayin' here without my piano."
438,438,You know what? You're overtired.
439,439,"No, I'm not."
440,440,God damn it!
441,441,My greatgreatgranddaddy and his slaves built the farm that I grew up on.
442,442,"One time, my granddaddy told me to go out, grab a handful of dirt from the yard and bring it in."
443,443,"He said, ""What are you holdin', son?"" And I said, ""Dirt."" ""That's right. Now give it to me."" So I did, and he says, ""Now what's this I've got in my hand?"" ""Dirt,"" I says."
444,444,"""No, boy, this is land that I've gotten."
445,445,"Do you know why?"" Because I own it. Because it's mine."
446,446,"""And one day, it'll be yours."" Except that land never became mine."
447,447,"No, Pappy sold it after the flood."
448,448,He told people that the river wiped him out.
449,449,But that was just a lie.
450,450,He walked away from that land gladly.
451,451,The army made Jamie a bomber pilot.
452,452,It was my fault that he's up there.
453,453,"I made him promise if he ever had to be a soldier, he would get up to the sky."
454,454,They say battle is cleaner up there.
455,455,It all looks clear.
456,456,Adam's on the left.
457,457,He sure is.
458,458,All right.
459,459,Missed my daughter's birthday.
460,460,She's not too happy about that.
461,461,We'll get back soon.
462,462,"I'll get you back safe, Rog."
463,463,"All right, I'll hold you to that."
464,464,You got your pinup girl. I got mine.
465,465,"Yeah, but mine's from a magazine."
466,466,Dear family...
467,467,I'm writing you from a village in Belgium called Tillet.
468,468,"Belgium is a country just north of France, and it's beautiful."
469,469,Daddy would like it around here.
470,470,There's lots of farms.
471,471,What's this?
472,472," ""Come out fighting""?"
473,473," Yeah, man."
474,474,"Of course, by the time you get this, I'll probably be long gone from here."
475,475,We always seem to be on the move.
476,476, Man all guns!
477,477, On me!
478,478,Move out! Let's go!
479,479,Come on! Roll out! Roll out!
480,480, These people ready to go?
481,481, Let's move!
482,482,Did you shoot your horse?
483,483," What kind of man shoots his horse, Carl?"
484,484, Someone...
485,485, Can't even get his feeding on time.
486,486, My horse ate my tobacco!
487,487, It's my property!
488,488," Carl, I've heard enough, okay?"
489,489,I don't wanna hear no more!
490,490,"Okay? If you can't do your job, I can't keep you on!"
491,491," Henry, no."
492,492," Now, you know that!"
493,493,"Henry. Henry, I got..."
494,494,Please. I got Vera and the girls and I got one on the way!
495,495, I mean...
496,496," Man, I got..."
497,497,"I got a wife. I got kids, Carl."
498,498, I don't got anyplace else to go.
499,499," I got a wife. I got kids, okay?"
500,500,"I'm runnin' a farm, not a charity."
501,501, You got till the end of the week!
502,502, Please!
503,503,The end of the week.
504,504,Then I want you gone!
505,505,Violence is part and parcel of country life.
506,506,You're forever being assailed by dead things.
507,507,"Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums."
508,508,You find them in the yard.
509,509,You smell them rottin' under the house.
510,510,And then there are the creatures you kill for food.
511,511,"Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels."
512,512,"Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry."
513,513,"Eat, start again, kill."
514,514,I learned how to stitch up a bleeding wound...
515,515,load and fire a shotgun...
516,516,reach into the womb of a heavin' sow to deliver a breeched piglet.
517,517,My hands did these things...
518,518,but I was never easy in my mind.
519,519,"Howdy, Mrs. McAllan."
520,520,"Hello, Miss..."
521,521,Vera. You can call me Vera.
522,522,"Hello, Vera."
523,523,"This here's one of my daughters, Alma."
524,524,We need to talk to you.
525,525,You can't put us off.
526,526,Excuse me?
527,527,We ain't got nowhere to go if you put us out.
528,528,Ain't nobody gonna hire us this late in the season.
529,529,"It's not up to me, Vera."
530,530,It's up to my husband.
531,531,I'm asking you to keep us on.
532,532,I'm tellin' you it's not my decision.
533,533,And if it was?
534,534,Alma.
535,535,Dear family...
536,536,The locals treat us real nice.
537,537,They ain't like the white folks back home.
538,538,I get homesick.
539,539,And they do all they can to make us feel right at home.
540,540,I'm mighty grateful for that.
541,541,Ronsel.
542,542,Henry!
543,543,Henry!
544,544, What?
545,545," Henry, your wife wants you."
546,546,"Isabelle's sick and the other one's comin' down with it, too."
547,547,I'm comin'!
548,548,It's whooping cough. Go get the doctor.
549,549,And tell your father to put water on to boil.
550,550,"Henry, go!"
551,551,Go!
552,552,"""I wish you were all there to see it."" Her dress was so glitty... glittery."
553,553,Even the white GI's couldn't take their eyes off her.
554,554,Tell Lilly May even the great Lena Horne hasn't got half the voice she does.
555,555,Make sure Ruel stays practicing his fastball.
556,556,Tell Marlon.
557,557,"I tried to save him some snow, but it melted."
558,558,"""So I'll be bringin' him a glass of water instead."" All right."
559,559,"""And...""  Hap!"
560,560," Comin', sir!"
561,561,"Hap, I need your wife. I need Florence."
562,562,"My girls are comin' down sick with a whooping cough, and I can't get to town on account of the bridge been washed out."
563,563,I remember you said she was a midwife.
564,564," My wife ain't no doctor, sir."
565,565," I realize that, Hap, but my wife needs some help and I thought..."
566,566, When did they start the whooping?
567,567, Isabelle started a couple of days ago and Amanda Leigh started coughing a few hours back.
568,568,They still catching.
569,569,"She can get you some remedies to take, but she can't go with you, sir."
570,570,I can pay you.
571,571,I won't be able to come home for about three or four days.
572,572, Who's gonna look after my own family?
573,573, Please.
574,574,My wife is afraid.
575,575,I didn't have the luxury of only lovin' my own children.
576,576,"My own mother, I remember being blue."
577,577,Blue from the dark of the mornin'.
578,578,"When the moon would still be up, she kissin' me and my sisters on the eyelids, us pretendin' to be asleep."
579,579,She goin' off to work...
580,580,to wake and kiss some other woman's children in the sunlight.
581,581,I swore that my own children would have all of me.
582,582,Mind your step.
583,583, This is Florence.
584,584, Who's this?
585,585,She's a midwife.
586,586, Do you see anybody giving birth here?
587,587, The bridge is washed out.
588,588, She might be able to help.
589,589, The girls need a doctor...
590,590,Damn bridge is flooded.
591,591, What do you want me to do?
592,592, Take her.
593,593,I've seen this with my own children.
594,594,We gotta get liquid down 'em.
595,595,But first we gotta clear out some of this phlegm.
596,596,And that's real good you makin' that steam for 'em.
597,597,"Mr. McAllan, would you kindly boil some more water, sir."
598,598,I want Mama!
599,599,That'll draw the phlegm right out of them.
600,600,I should've taken them to the doctor as soon as they started coughing.
601,601,If anything happens...
602,602,Now I know what my mother must've known.
603,603,Your girls are gonna be just fine.
604,604,Okay.
605,605,"That if something had ever happened to that other woman's children, that would have been the end of us."
606,606,Now I know that she left us not just out of duty...
607,607, but out of love.
608,608, I'm thirsty.
609,609,"Do you hear me, gal? I want some damn..."
610,610, You put that knife up to me...
611,611, Now I know...
612,612, I will slap the piss out of you.
613,613, That love is a kind of survival.
614,614,We're taking hits.
615,615,What's going on back there?
616,616,I have visual. I have visual.
617,617,Bring it around. Bring it around.
618,618,They took out the tail gunner!
619,619,Take it down!
620,620,I need some altitude.
621,621,Grab a left! Grab a left!
622,622,Pull it up!
623,623,"Here we go, Captain!"
624,624,"Roger! Hey, hey! Roger!"
625,625,We broke formation!
626,626,"Roger, come on!"
627,627,"Front gunner, are you up there?"
628,628,I'm still with you!
629,629,I got him! I got him!
630,630, We got some coming on the left!
631,631, I see 'em!
632,632,Cover me! Cover me!
633,633,"Oh, no!"
634,634,No!
635,635,Mama?
636,636,Mornin'.
637,637,Glad to see you feelin' better.
638,638,"Well, we have some good news for ya."
639,639,We'd like to offer you a job.
640,640,Workin' here for me.
641,641,I'll need help with the girls.
642,642,"Cookin', cleanin', that sort of thing."
643,643,It means extra money for you and your family.
644,644,We don't belong to them.
645,645,"We pay rent, work our crops for us."
646,646,That's it.
647,647,"They can't just pick us up, set us down like we tools."
648,648,"You're the one always talkin' about saving, how owning our own parcel the only way to get out from under their foot."
649,649, We right there.
650,650, I don't want you workin' for them.
651,651,I won't be workin' for them.
652,652,I'd be workin' for us.
653,653,I already said yes.
654,654,"""For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church."" ""An excellent wife, who can find?"" She's more precious than jewels."
655,655,"""Her husband trust in her, and he will have no lack of gain."" All those Sundays."
656,656," You really are listenin', huh?"
657,657, Yes.
658,658,And now you must listen to me.
659,659,"""In my father's house are many mansions."" I know that to be so."
660,660,"If it wasn't so, I would've told you."
661,661,I go to prepare a place for you.
662,662,"""That where I am, ye may be also."" I know that brings me comfort."
663,663,It brings me comfort to know that...
664,664,"one day, my getting up gonna be just a little bit easier than it was the day before."
665,665,One mornin'...
666,666,my children ain't gonna wake up to this place.
667,667,They gonna open their eyes up on a new sky.
668,668,"One mornin', we're gonna break this boot from 'round our neck and shake these chains from 'rounds our feets."
669,669,One mornin'.
670,670,And I ain't talkin' about the hereafter.
671,671,I'm talkin' about the right now.
672,672,Right now!
673,673, One mornin'!
674,674, One mornin'!
675,675,I said...
676,676,Fire!
677,677,Fire!
678,678,"Nice shot, baby! Nice shot!"
679,679,Out of the tank! Out of the tank!
680,680,"Out, out, out!"
681,681,Out of the tank! Out of the tank!
682,682,Dad! Dad!
683,683,I got you!
684,684,Move! Move! Move! Get down!
685,685,I need a medic! I need a medic!
686,686,Lingered along. Lingered along.
687,687,Laid in that bed knowing my wife out doin' my work for me.
688,688,Florence's hands all blistered up.
689,689,And I seen her rubbin' her back when she thought I wasn't lookin'.
690,690,The rain came that next day.
691,691,"A big, hard rain that packed the fields tight as wax."
692,692,Nothin' we could do.
693,693,"Sat there, watchin' and frettin' for two days till it finally cleared up."
694,694,"Hap, you in there?"
695,695,"Yes, sir."
696,696, How you feelin'?
697,697," Gettin' better by the day, sir."
698,698,"Well, you look like you know what you're doing there."
699,699,Family tradition.
700,700,How much longer you reckon you're gonna be laid up for?
701,701,"Oh, well, Doc Turpin says six weeks."
702,702,It's already been four.
703,703,I bet I'll be out there by Monday.
704,704," Monday, you reckon? Well..."
705,705," Yes, sir."
706,706,I'll come to it. I don't...
707,707,I don't think you're gonna get everythin' in the ground on time.
708,708,You're cuttin' it close.
709,709,"Florence and the boys are out there workin' double time, sir."
710,710,And you know field needs to be rebroke 'cause of that rain.
711,711,"Mmm, don't I know it? Yeah, wish we could control the rain."
712,712,"Y'all ought to be well into plantin' by now, and you haven't even gotten your fields laid by."
713,713,"Can't afford to wait any longer, Hap."
714,714,You're a farmer. You understand that.
715,715,"Yes, sir."
716,716,"Of course, if you had a mule..."
717,717,you'd be done in no time.
718,718," We lost that mule to lockjaw, sir."
719,719, I know.
720,720,Florence and the boys out there...
721,721,"You're gonna have to rent one of my mules, Hap."
722,722,You'll go on half shares till you pay it off.
723,723,Send one of your boys around after dinner to fetch that mule.
724,724,"Yes, sir."
725,725,"Honey, by the way, I forgot to tell ya."
726,726,Florence ain't gonna be able to work with us for a while.
727,727,What do you mean Florence isn't comin' back?
728,728,"Well, not till the end of July, anyways."
729,729,Until we get the seed in the ground.
730,730, Where's Hap?
731,731, Hap broke his leg. I told ya.
732,732, No.
733,733, I did.
734,734," You didn't, Henry."
735,735, I did.
736,736,I need help with the girls.
737,737,Can't you lend them a mule...
738,738,"No, I can't lend him a mule."
739,739,You don't just lend somebody a mule.
740,740,Why don't I just give 'em the whole farm while I'm at it?
741,741,"I mean, if they can't get the seed in the ground in time, they need to rent one of ours, and they can pay us a half share for it."
742,742,"It's tough on them, but it's good for us."
743,743,Hap hurt himself working for us.
744,744,"No, Laura, Hap Jackson hurt himself workin' for Hap Jackson."
745,745, Farming's a business.
746,746, I just think...
747,747,"You just think. Well, I just sank everything we have into this farm."
748,748,Everything.
749,749,"We need to make some money this year, or our family's in trouble."
750,750,"Now, do you understand that?"
751,751,Do you?
752,752,"Yes, Henry."
753,753,"All right, then. Hmm? Come on."
754,754,The date the Confederate forces crushed the Union army in the Battle of Richmond.
755,755,I don't think he knew that I knew the combination.
756,756, Hello. Mrs. Jackson?
757,757, Yes?
758,758,I'm Dr. Pearlman.
759,759,I'm here to treat your husband.
760,760,"Oh, thank you. Come in."
761,761,"If you'd asked me before then, I'd have told you all white folks was the same."
762,762,Henry stayed mad at me...
763,763,and he showed it by ignoring me in our bed.
764,764,"I hadn't always enjoyed Henry's lovemaking, but it made me feel like a true wife."
765,765,I never thought of refusin' him.
766,766,How could he refuse me?
767,767,This is a solemn but glorious hour.
768,768,General Eisenhower informs me...
769,769,that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations.
770,770,The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.
771,771,"For this victory, we join in offering our thanks to the providence which has guided and sustained us..."
772,772, Hitler is dead!
773,773, War is over!
774,774,Hitler's dead!
775,775,"This is over, yes?"
776,776,War is over!
777,777,Boom!
778,778,We're in enemy territory.
779,779,We're in enemy territory.
780,780,"You dead, cracker, you dead!"
781,781,We're runnin' over 'em.
782,782,"Watch your right, gunner."
783,783,Bang!
784,784,You dead.
785,785,Saturday was my favorite day of the week.
786,786,It was the only day I felt truly clean.
787,787, Am I sitting down?
788,788, Yes. Sit down.
789,789,"The rest of the time, we stank."
790,790,"Mama, somebody's coming!"
791,791, Uncle Jamie!
792,792, Uncle Jamie!
793,793,Now come give your Uncle Jamie a hug.
794,794,Who's that?
795,795,Is that my little Amanda doll?
796,796, And who is this? My little Bella.
797,797, Jamie!
798,798, Oh! Give your Uncle Jamie a hug!
799,799, Jamie! Whoohoohoo!
800,800, You have grown so big!
801,801, Whoohoo! Jamie!
802,802," Now, who's that?"
803,803, Oh!
804,804,"Come on, girls."
805,805,"You look good, brother."
806,806,You look like hell.
807,807, Don't sugarcoat it now.
808,808," ""Don't sugarcoat it."" Come on!"
809,809,Huh?
810,810,You see him in his uniform?
811,811,"Oh, my sweet sisterinlaw."
812,812," Welcome home, Jamie."
813,813, Come here.
814,814, All right.
815,815, You gonna see what he's got? Huh?
816,816,How you enjoyin' it here in Henry's version of paradise?
817,817,You'd think a son would see fit to say hello to his own father.
818,818,"Oh, dearest Pappy."
819,819,"God, how much I missed you."
820,820,"He's missed you, too, though he won't admit it."
821,821,"Yeah. Well, I bet he's quit chewing chaw and joined the NAACP, too."
822,822,"Come on, I can't believe you walked out here!"
823,823,Well...
824,824,I didn't wanna bother you guys.
825,825,"It's, uh..."
826,826,That's the last thing that she said.
827,827,Boy!
828,828,"Oh, Lord!"
829,829,"Oh, boy."
830,830,"So, what's it like being a big war hero?"
831,831," Shit, I wouldn't know."
832,832," No, don't give me that."
833,833,Army wrote me letters about your fancy medals.
834,834,Said it was the highest honor an airman could achieve.
835,835, They did?
836,836, Well...
837,837,I was lucky.
838,838, Other men weren't.
839,839, Yeah. Well...
840,840,"I bet you got plenty of tail out if it, too."
841,841,"Oh, Jamie never needed medals to get girls, Pappy."
842,842,Mmm?
843,843, Take after me that way.
844,844, Hmm.
845,845,Your mama was the prettiest girl in Greenville.
846,846,And I had 'em all sniffing up after me.
847,847,Yeah. I'll tell you one thing for sure.
848,848,You had to kill a whole lot of Krauts to get them medals.
849,849,"How many did you take out, you reckon?"
850,850,Fifty? Fifty? A hundred?
851,851," Oh, I don't know."
852,852," Well, take a guess."
853,853,I don't know.
854,854,What... What's the matter?
855,855,Man ought to know how many men he's killed.
856,856,Well...
857,857,I'll tell you one thing.
858,858,It was more than one.
859,859,"Well, son..."
860,860,at least I looked my one in the eye before I shot him.
861,861,Not like dropping bombs from a mile up in the air.
862,862,Pappy.
863,863," Pappy, come on."
864,864, To hell with him.
865,865,Why'd you have to go and do that?
866,866,Hmm?
867,867,He's just proud of you.
868,868, That's all.
869,869, Mmm.
870,870, Yeah.
871,871," Got a point, though."
872,872,We should hit the hay.
873,873,You'll be okay on the couch?
874,874,Yeah.
875,875,Come on.
876,876,"Good to see you, little brother."
877,877,Appreciate you and Laura for having me.
878,878,Okay.
879,879,You need a good night's sleep.
880,880,Feed you up. Get some meat on those bones.
881,881,"Actually, it was more like four."
882,882,Four what?
883,883,Miles up in the air.
884,884,The altitude we dropped those bombs from.
885,885,The hell you even see anything that high up?
886,886,You'd be surprised.
887,887,"Roads, cities, factories."
888,888,Just not people.
889,889,Pappy's right.
890,890,Man ought to know.
891,891,Good night.
892,892,"Home again, home again. Jiggityjig."
893,893,"Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!"
894,894,"Coon, spade, darky, nigger."
895,895,Went off to fight for my country to come back and find it hadn't changed a bit.
896,896,Thank you.
897,897,"Howdy, Miss Tricklebank."
898,898,Ronsel... is that you?
899,899,"Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked."
900,900,"Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up!"
901,901,How are ya?
902,902,I am mighty fine. How've you been?
903,903,"Oh, I'm getting' along fine."
904,904,I'm getting along fine.
905,905,You seen your folks yet?
906,906,"No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em a couple of things before I went home."
907,907,"Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan."
908,908,Your parents work on our farm.
909,909,"How you do, ma'am?"
910,910,Your mother talks about you all the time.
911,911,I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.
912,912,Is that everything?
913,913,"Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get some sugar and some candy."
914,914,Sugar and candy?
915,915,"Yes. The sugar's for my mama, and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May."
916,916,Figured I'd spoil 'em a little bit.
917,917, Sergeant's pay.
918,918, I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
919,919,"Yes, ma'am."
920,920,You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.
921,921,Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.
922,922,"Where do you think you're goin', boy?"
923,923,"I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin' to get home to see my folks."
924,924, Not that way you ain't.
925,925," Pappy, this is Ronsel."
926,926,Hap and Florence's son.
927,927,Just returned from overseas.
928,928,"Oh, oh!"
929,929,"Well, that explains why you're tryin' to leave by the front door."
930,930,You must be confused as to your whereabouts.
931,931," No, sir, I'm not confused at all."
932,932," Oh, I think you are, boy."
933,933,"I don't know what they let you do over there, but you're in Mississippi now, nigger."
934,934,You use the back door.
935,935,"Go on, son."
936,936,"Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on."
937,937,Go on.
938,938,You know what? You're absolutely right.
939,939,"When we was overseas, they didn't make us use the back door."
940,940,General Patton put us on the front line.
941,941,"Yes, sir. You know what we did?"
942,942,We kicked the hell out of Hitler and them Jerries.
943,943,While y'all at home safe and sound.
944,944,"Henry, I'm almost done here."
945,945,"Home again, home again."
946,946,"Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ, our Lord and savior."
947,947,"And, Lord, thank you for the sun you've been sending to make the cotton grow, and for the health of all here present."
948,948,"And, Lord Jesus, please watch over my boy Ronsel, wherever in creation he may be."
949,949,Amen.
950,950,Ronsel!
951,951,"Hey, hey, hey."
952,952,"Oh, my baby!"
953,953,"Oh, look at you. You're so grown."
954,954," Handsome, too."
955,955, Lilly May! Hey.
956,956,"Oh, Marlon, look at you."
957,957,"You about my size. You shot up, huh?"
958,958, What'd you get them medals for?
959,959, How was the trip home?
960,960,For killing Germans?
961,961, Why you ain't tell us you was coming?
962,962, Quit fussing over him now...
963,963,and let him come say hello to his father.
964,964,I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.
965,965,"Thank you, God. Look at you."
966,966,Look at you.
967,967,What in the devil happened to you?
968,968,"Mom, I brought you some groceries."
969,969,"Oh, thank you, baby."
970,970,"Come on, sit down."
971,971,Providence.
972,972, Want some rice?
973,973," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
974,974," Thank you, God."
975,975, Amen.
976,976,"I ain't never known you to smoke, son."
977,977,"Well, a lot's changed, Pop."
978,978,You sure you get enough to eat?
979,979,Yes.
980,980,"I'm stuffed. I used to be dreamin' about them biscuits, too."
981,981,"Yeah, I dreamt about you, too."
982,982,What'd you see?
983,983,"You back with us now, safe and sound."
984,984,Be nice to have another pair of hands.
985,985,"With you home, we might can make up what we lost after my accident."
986,986,"Pay off the lien, get a new contract, go back to being tenants next year."
987,987,Maybe he got plans of his own.
988,988,"Let him follow his own mind, Hap."
989,989,"No, no, Mama."
990,990,"Yes, of course, I'll stay."
991,991,Of course.
992,992,Give me time to figure things out and put this war behind me.
993,993,What's he want now?
994,994,"Evening, Mr. McAllan."
995,995,"Evening, Hap. Florence."
996,996,This our son Ronsel I told you about.
997,997,"Yeah, we already met."
998,998," Hap, I'd better speak to you alone."
999,999, Huh.
1000,1000,"I'm not a child, sir."
1001,1001,"Anything you can say to my daddy, you can say in front of me."
1002,1002,"All right, then. You're asking for a whole heap of trouble..."
1003,1003,acting the way you did at Tricklebank's earlier.
1004,1004,"Now, I know you don't want that kinda trouble."
1005,1005,"Not for yourself, or for your family."
1006,1006,"Boy, what'd you do?"
1007,1007,He couldn't have done anything.
1008,1008, I just tried to walk out the door is all.
1009,1009, The front door.
1010,1010,"When my father and another man corrected him, he gave a fine speech."
1011,1011,"Put us all in our places, didn't you?"
1012,1012,Is that true?
1013,1013,Then I reckon you best apologize.
1014,1014,"I'm sorry, sir."
1015,1015,All right.
1016,1016,"My father's gonna want an apology, too."
1017,1017,"Ronsel will pay him a visit after church tomorrow, sir."
1018,1018,"Won't you, son?"
1019,1019,"Yes, sir."
1020,1020, Welcome home.
1021,1021," Thank you, sir."
1022,1022,You have a good night.
1023,1023,No point in fightin'.
1024,1024,They just gonna win every time.
1025,1025,"Just not used to walking away from a fight, Daddy, that's all."
1026,1026,Not no more.
1027,1027,How long you been back?
1028,1028,"Oh, just couple of weeks."
1029,1029,Mmhmm. And how are you liking Marietta?
1030,1030,"Oh, it's a lovely little town."
1031,1031,Just lovely.
1032,1032,"Oh, I got that one right there."
1033,1033,Put that there.
1034,1034,"Much obliged, Miss Tricklebank."
1035,1035,You have yourself a wonderful day.
1036,1036, Take care.
1037,1037, Yeah.
1038,1038,Look at that.
1039,1039, What's that about?
1040,1040, What's wrong with him?
1041,1041,He must've just come back from the war.
1042,1042,It's all right.
1043,1043,It's just a car. It must've backfired.
1044,1044,Stuck intake valve.
1045,1045,They say it stops eventually.
1046,1046,You're Ronsel. Hap's son.
1047,1047,Jamie McAllan. Henry's Brother.
1048,1048,Pleasure to meet you.
1049,1049,You walk here?
1050,1050,Yes.
1051,1051,Let me give you a lift.
1052,1052,Come on.
1053,1053,This is Bob Dunning with the highlights for the 15th Annual AllStar Game.
1054,1054, Come on up front!
1055,1055, I'm fine right where I am.
1056,1056,"Get in, soldier. That's an order."
1057,1057,"In the National League, heavy artillery."
1058,1058,"John Mize, Walker Cooper, Ralph Kiner and Stan Musial."
1059,1059,"The American League pioneers, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, George Kell and Lou Boudreau."
1060,1060, How'd you know you outrank me?
1061,1061, I was a captain.
1062,1062,They got Negro captains.
1063,1063,I served under plenty of 'em.
1064,1064,"Well, you obeyed my order."
1065,1065,I bet you was a sergeant.
1066,1066,"""Come Out Fighting."" We spearheaded for General Patton."
1067,1067,You?
1068,1068,I flew B25s.
1069,1069,"So, Sergeant, how do you like being back here in the delta?"
1070,1070,"Yeah, me, too."
1071,1071, Heard you and my pappy had some words.
1072,1072, I apologized for that.
1073,1073,He's a disagreeable son of a bitch.
1074,1074,I'm sure he had it coming.
1075,1075, Here's to you.
1076,1076," I'm fine, thank you."
1077,1077,"Boy, you always this stubborn, or just around white people tryin' to be nice?"
1078,1078,Go on.
1079,1079,"Now, what kind of NCO are you?"
1080,1080,"Now, don't waste it, now."
1081,1081,That's my medicine.
1082,1082,I need every drop.
1083,1083,You tanker boys ever piss in your helmets?
1084,1084, Plenty of times.
1085,1085, We had a relief tube up in the cockpit.
1086,1086,Sometimes it was easier just to go in our flak helmets.
1087,1087,"But at 20,000 feet, that piss freezes solid in less than a minute."
1088,1088,It's that cold up there?
1089,1089,"Shit. I'm talking 20, 30 below."
1090,1090,"One time we were on this long haul, I pissed in my helmet, I forgot all about it."
1091,1091,We were just over the target.
1092,1092,I put the helmet back on.
1093,1093,"We're doing this bombing run, dodgin' enemy flak, and all of a sudden, I started feelin' something runnin' down my face."
1094,1094,"Yeah, I thought I was hit."
1095,1095,I smelled like a damn latrine.
1096,1096,"Yeah, you must've caught hell back at that officer's club, too."
1097,1097,"Boy, my friends never let me hear the end of it."
1098,1098,"The ones that made it back, anyway."
1099,1099,"Yeah, I lost some friends, too."
1100,1100,"Well, here's to them."
1101,1101,"""I wouldn't get home until...""  Everythin' all right, Mr. Jamie?"
1102,1102," Oh, everything's just fine."
1103,1103,Just gave Ronsel here a little lift from town.
1104,1104,I'll be heading back to town next Saturday afternoon.
1105,1105,"If you like, I'll stop by here and see if you want a ride."
1106,1106,That'd be fine.
1107,1107,"Well, all right."
1108,1108,Hap.
1109,1109,Oh!
1110,1110,"Oh, Lord."
1111,1111,"I got you somethin', Mom."
1112,1112,Oh.
1113,1113,This is so much.
1114,1114,I'll save it for your brother and sister.
1115,1115,They'll love it.
1116,1116,No.
1117,1117, I got it for you.
1118,1118," Oh, baby, I can't."
1119,1119,I'm gonna watch you eat it.
1120,1120,Hmm.
1121,1121,Mmhmm.
1122,1122,"Thank you, son."
1123,1123,"Finish it, Mom. Don't save it."
1124,1124,"Don't save it, Mom."
1125,1125,I better not see Lilly May or Marlon with none of that.
1126,1126,All right.
1127,1127,I love you.
1128,1128,"I love you, too, sweetie."
1129,1129,Thank you.
1130,1130,I can't...
1131,1131,I tried.
1132,1132,I'm sorry.
1133,1133,I can't...
1134,1134,I can't swim.
1135,1135,"Oh, God."
1136,1136,"Oh, God."
1137,1137,"Oh, my God."
1138,1138,Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Jamie.
1139,1139,It's okay. It's okay.
1140,1140,It's me. It's me. It's okay. It's okay.
1141,1141,"It's okay. Come here, come here."
1142,1142,No.
1143,1143,"No, I can't."
1144,1144, Jamie.
1145,1145, I gotta go.
1146,1146,"As usual, when anything bad happened, Henry was away."
1147,1147,"He and Pappy had gone to see about some hogs, so I was alone with the girls."
1148,1148,Vera?
1149,1149,You need to take me to town.
1150,1150,I'm gonna kill Carl.
1151,1151,"Vera, why don't you come and sit down and we'll talk..."
1152,1152,I don't have time to sit down.
1153,1153,He's with her now.
1154,1154,"Started in on Alma, just like with Renie."
1155,1155,"Amanda Leigh, take your sister into the house."
1156,1156,"Amanda, go on. Go on 'round the back, go."
1157,1157, Vera?
1158,1158, You gotta take me to town now.
1159,1159, I can't drive.
1160,1160, I seen you drivin'...
1161,1161,And I got in trouble for it.
1162,1162,My husband took the keys away.
1163,1163,Come on.
1164,1164,They found Carl's body laying in the road halfway to town.
1165,1165,Florence said she'd seen her walking down Main Street covered in blood.
1166,1166,She said it looked like she'd bathed in it.
1167,1167,Vera had stabbed him 17 times.
1168,1168,But I didn't find out those details till later.
1169,1169,I was too lost in my own misery.
1170,1170,"What's wrong, Mama?"
1171,1171,"Amanda Leigh, I need you to be a big girl and go and get Florence."
1172,1172,You remember how to get there?
1173,1173,"Good girl, run as fast as you can."
1174,1174,No!
1175,1175,No!
1176,1176,"I lost one of my babies once, too."
1177,1177,His name was Samuel.
1178,1178,I used to come here all the time when I was a boy.
1179,1179,Just when I needed to be alone and clear my mind.
1180,1180,"Well, I like what you've done with the place."
1181,1181,Here.
1182,1182,Why are you being so nice to me?
1183,1183,You look like you could use it.
1184,1184,Bullshit.
1185,1185,We were somewhere over Austria.
1186,1186,We made contact with a whole swarm of Messerschmitts.
1187,1187,"I mean, they was everywhere."
1188,1188,"Took out my tail gun, copilot..."
1189,1189,Made a deal with God right there.
1190,1190,"Swore if he saved me, I was gonna do somethin' good."
1191,1191,"I don't know what that was, but..."
1192,1192,I promised anyway.
1193,1193,"Before you know, whole bunch of P51s show up..."
1194,1194,just like goddamn cavalry.
1195,1195,They cleared those Germans right out of the sky.
1196,1196,"And I swear, they were angels sent by the Lord himself."
1197,1197,"Those P51s, their tails was painted red."
1198,1198,One of 'em buzzed me right after the flight.
1199,1199,I looked over.
1200,1200,I thought I was seeing things.
1201,1201,That fighter pilot...
1202,1202,he was colored.
1203,1203,He saluted me...
1204,1204,I saluted him back.
1205,1205,Men that died that day...
1206,1206,"they were husbands, fathers."
1207,1207,They were good men.
1208,1208,A lot better than me.
1209,1209,"Oh, well."
1210,1210,"We brought this for you, Mama."
1211,1211,"This is for you, Mama."
1212,1212,"Now, you gotta..."
1213,1213,You can't have a shower without the screen up.
1214,1214,"Now, where do we put that?"
1215,1215,What are you thinkin'?
1216,1216,"Maybe here, in the water?"
1217,1217,Now you gotta help me figure out where to put this.
1218,1218,What do you think? In there?
1219,1219,You can smell it.
1220,1220,"Mommy, Uncle Jamie's building you a shower."
1221,1221,You little angel.
1222,1222,You were supposed to tell me if she was gonna be comin'.
1223,1223,Thought you might want a little privacy...
1224,1224,"every now and then, if you were havin' a bath."
1225,1225,What you think?
1226,1226,I think it's marvelous.
1227,1227,Thank you.
1228,1228,Well...
1229,1229,I'll fetch some water.
1230,1230,"They smell good, baby."
1231,1231,He hardly eats... hardly sleeps.
1232,1232,Can't sit still... can't move.
1233,1233,It's like he's just stewing.
1234,1234,Waiting for somethin'.
1235,1235,Waiting for whatever didn't happen to happen.
1236,1236,Come on!
1237,1237,This bottle ain't gonna drink itself.
1238,1238,Whoohoo!
1239,1239,Already losing daylight!
1240,1240,Hold your horses. How you doin'?
1241,1241,"I'd be happy to see me, too."
1242,1242,"Woman, you ain't tired?"
1243,1243, We gotta let him go.
1244,1244, We ain't holdin' him.
1245,1245,He's staying for us. I know he is.
1246,1246,"Well, what if he wants to stay?"
1247,1247,It's not always gonna be like this.
1248,1248,Soon as I'm healed...
1249,1249,we'll move out of here.
1250,1250,We'll be okay.
1251,1251,He'll be okay once he has his own place.
1252,1252,We'll be okay?
1253,1253,I guarantee it.
1254,1254,Remember that?
1255,1255,"Yes, I do."
1256,1256,"You know what? You ain't supposed to be up on that broke leg all the time, Jackson."
1257,1257,"If you don't let it heal, you ain't never gonna walk."
1258,1258,Why walk if I can't dance?
1259,1259,"Lovely woman, you are."
1260,1260,Silver Star?
1261,1261, Yeah.
1262,1262, Damn.
1263,1263,Don't be impressed.
1264,1264,I got it for being stupid.
1265,1265,What?
1266,1266,You ever miss it sometimes?
1267,1267,Being over there.
1268,1268,"I don't mean being shot at, but sometimes, I actually miss it."
1269,1269,"Yeah, me, too."
1270,1270,"Over there, I was a liberator."
1271,1271,People lined up in the streets waiting for us.
1272,1272,Throwing flowers and cheering.
1273,1273,"And here, I'm just another nigger pushing a plow."
1274,1274,"Some of the men, too."
1275,1275," Yeah, I think about 'em every day."
1276,1276, Seeing different parts of the world.
1277,1277,"Italian girls, English girls..."
1278,1278,Some of those hairy Greek girls with those big old hairy muffs...
1279,1279,"Yeah, it was somethin' else."
1280,1280,"It was somethin', man."
1281,1281,You ever been with a white girl?
1282,1282,"Shit, well... I'll be damned. Huh?"
1283,1283,"Oh, yeah? Tell me."
1284,1284,"Army gave us separate barracks, separate blood supply, separate latrines."
1285,1285,But them European girls didn't have a problem with us at all.
1286,1286,"One day, we were up in Wimborne, old English girl walked past and slapped me right on my butt."
1287,1287,Never laid eyes on her.
1288,1288,Said the white GI's told her that we was more monkey than human.
1289,1289,And she was checking for a tail.
1290,1290,I'm sorry to laugh.
1291,1291,"So every opportunity we got, we showed 'em just how human we were."
1292,1292, Yep.
1293,1293," German girls, too, huh?"
1294,1294,Mmhmm.
1295,1295,Uhoh.
1296,1296,"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
1297,1297,I seen that look before.
1298,1298,Huh?
1299,1299,She must have been somethin' special.
1300,1300,"But that was then, this is now, and I guess I'm right where I should be."
1301,1301,Yep. Right where I need to be.
1302,1302,Throwing my life away.
1303,1303," I'll get you back safe, Rog."
1304,1304, I'll hold you to that.
1305,1305,We got some coming on the left!
1306,1306,They took out the tail gunner!
1307,1307,"Roger, come on, talk to me!"
1308,1308,"Oh, shit."
1309,1309,"We'll get it hauled out tomorrow, Henry."
1310,1310,I'm sorry.
1311,1311,Check? All right.
1312,1312,It's half past nine.
1313,1313,You just now gettin' up?
1314,1314,So I guess you gonna lay around all day while your brothers and sisters work?
1315,1315,Hmm?
1316,1316,"What's wrong with you, son?"
1317,1317,"What's wrong with you, boy?"
1318,1318,Letter came for you.
1319,1319,Says it's all the way from Germany.
1320,1320,Germany.
1321,1321,"Who's, uh, Resl? Ress..."
1322,1322,Is that a man or a woman?
1323,1323,"How you... RESL. Ressil, Reecil..."
1324,1324,How you pronounce that?
1325,1325,Somebody that I knew.
1326,1326,Where... Where you goin'?
1327,1327,I'll be back!
1328,1328,Ronsel!
1329,1329,"Oh, you think it's funny, do you?"
1330,1330,Spilling good milk.
1331,1331,"Well, you know what they say."
1332,1332,"""No use crying over it."" Yeah, at least, when it's somebody else's, that is."
1333,1333,"What do I... what do I owe you here, like, a buck fifty? Maybe two?"
1334,1334,Let's just make it even.
1335,1335, I'm not talkin' about money!
1336,1336, What do you want from me?
1337,1337,What's the matter with you? Be a man!
1338,1338,"Oh, yeah? One pail of spilled milk and I ain't a man?"
1339,1339,You sure as hell ain't actin' like it!
1340,1340,"You come and go as you please, you disappear for days on end, and when you are here, you're drunk."
1341,1341,I don't answer to you.
1342,1342,"When you're under my roof and you work on my farm, you do."
1343,1343,"Oh, I'm sorry there, Mr. Boss Man."
1344,1344,Ain't my fault your damn farmin' dreams ain't working out.
1345,1345,Ain't my fault that your damn cotton fields are flooded out!
1346,1346,"You know your problem, Jamie?"
1347,1347,"You don't know your own worth, brother."
1348,1348,You don't know what a man needs to know.
1349,1349,A man ought to know.
1350,1350," You better open your eyes, big brother."
1351,1351, Open my eyes to what?
1352,1352,You're so busy walkin' around here  like God Almighty...
1353,1353, Huh?
1354,1354,"Worryin' about yourself and your farm, you can't even see your own wife is miserable!"
1355,1355,Just watch your mouth.
1356,1356, Or what?
1357,1357, Or what? Huh?
1358,1358," Yep. You know what, brother?"
1359,1359, Yeah?
1360,1360,"Fine, Jamie, go."
1361,1361,Be whatever kind of man you want to be.
1362,1362,Just do it someplace else.
1363,1363, That's fine. I'll go to town.
1364,1364, I'm not talkin' about town.
1365,1365,I'm going to Greenville tomorrow for a few days to see about livestock.
1366,1366,I'll expect you gone when I get back.
1367,1367,What's wrong with you?
1368,1368,You should have seen the look on your face.
1369,1369,It ain't funny.
1370,1370,"Au contraire, my friend. It is indeed."
1371,1371,You about crazy as hell.
1372,1372,"Well, I can't argue with that."
1373,1373,What you...
1374,1374,What you doin' walking in the rain?
1375,1375,It don't matter.
1376,1376,What's the matter with you?
1377,1377,What's the worst thing you ever did?
1378,1378,Something bad.
1379,1379,Real bad and you knew it was gonna hurt someone...
1380,1380,but you did it anyway.
1381,1381,Leavin' this woman right here.
1382,1382,"Well, I'll be."
1383,1383,"Congratulations, you're a father."
1384,1384,His name's Franz.
1385,1385,"Franz, that's a good name."
1386,1386,What you gonna do now?
1387,1387, She wants me to come back to Germany.
1388,1388, That's a long haul.
1389,1389,Yeah.
1390,1390,Long way.
1391,1391,"So, what about you?"
1392,1392,What's the worst thing you ever done?
1393,1393,"Who, me? I'm a saint."
1394,1394,I bet. I bet.
1395,1395,"Shit, put your head down."
1396,1396,You think they seen us?
1397,1397,I don't know.
1398,1398,"Well, here we are."
1399,1399,Yeah.
1400,1400,"Yeah, I'm leaving town soon."
1401,1401,I wanted to say good luck to you.
1402,1402,You've been a friend.
1403,1403,I want you to know that.
1404,1404,Yeah.
1405,1405,"You've been a friend, too."
1406,1406,You might be one of the good ones.
1407,1407,Take care.
1408,1408,I hope you find your way to your boy.
1409,1409,To your family.
1410,1410,"Take care of yourself, huh?"
1411,1411,"You, too."
1412,1412,"Hey, Mama."
1413,1413, You hungry?
1414,1414," No, I'm good."
1415,1415,Where is everybody?
1416,1416,Gone up to church. Late service.
1417,1417,Hmm.
1418,1418,Here.
1419,1419," And there he is, drunk again."
1420,1420, Uncle Jamie!
1421,1421,"Hello there, dear family."
1422,1422,Who the hell was that with you in the truck?
1423,1423,The one I seen you drivin'. Who was it?
1424,1424,Ronsel Jackson. What's it to you?
1425,1425,You wanna tell me why that nigger was ridin' upside you in the truck like two peas in a pod?
1426,1426,He can ride wherever I say. Anything else?
1427,1427,You. You son of a bitch.
1428,1428," You ain't worth a damn, you know that?"
1429,1429," Yeah, I know that."
1430,1430,"Mr. Big, Big War Hero, is ya?"
1431,1431,You're nothin' but a damn drunk!
1432,1432,Give me them keys.
1433,1433,Just go.
1434,1434,"Oh, you want him all to yourself, huh, gal?"
1435,1435,Too bad he's all liquored up.
1436,1436,He can't do you any good.
1437,1437, I beg your pardon?
1438,1438, I seen you sniffin' after him.
1439,1439, Pappy.
1440,1440," Maybe Henry is too thick to notice, but I ain't."
1441,1441," You seen the letter, Mama?"
1442,1442, The one from Germany?
1443,1443,"Oh, God, okay. All right. Hold on."
1444,1444,"Don't fret. Just wait till your father come back, okay?"
1445,1445,Ronsel? Ronsel!
1446,1446,"Hi, there."
1447,1447, You'll be here for supper tonight?
1448,1448," Uh, no."
1449,1449,You goin' someplace?
1450,1450,"Yeah. Might, uh, head out west."
1451,1451,Got a war buddy who lives in Los Angeles.
1452,1452,Los Angeles?
1453,1453,"Jamie, what are you talking about?"
1454,1454, He didn't tell you?
1455,1455, Who didn't tell me what?
1456,1456,Henry.
1457,1457,Told me to leave.
1458,1458, Probably for the best.
1459,1459," So just like that, you up and leave?"
1460,1460,Were you even plannin' on sayin' goodbye?
1461,1461,'Course. First bus don't leave till 2:00.
1462,1462,What about the girls?
1463,1463,This will break their hearts.
1464,1464,"Laura, I can't stay here."
1465,1465,I don't...
1466,1466,"You don't need to go, Jamie."
1467,1467, Whoo! Come here!
1468,1468, Get him!
1469,1469," Come here, boy!"
1470,1470, Get him! Get him!
1471,1471,Get him! Get him!
1472,1472,"Hold him down, boys!"
1473,1473," Yeah, punch that nigger!"
1474,1474, Hit that nigger!
1475,1475, Get him up.
1476,1476, Come on.
1477,1477,Put your shoes on. Come with us.
1478,1478, Good Lord. You turn him loose.
1479,1479, Shut up!
1480,1480,"Like hell, I will!"
1481,1481,"You turn him loose, damn it!"
1482,1482," You best listen, son."
1483,1483, I ain't your son!
1484,1484,"Now I suggest you use that thing, or you better point elsewhere."
1485,1485,"Otherwise, you better kill us both."
1486,1486,You betray your own blood for the sake of a nigger?
1487,1487,You do it.
1488,1488,Come on!
1489,1489, Go on. You do it.
1490,1490, Bring forth the evidence.
1491,1491, He's guilty!
1492,1492, Kill him!
1493,1493,Did you rut with this woman?
1494,1494,What the hell do you fellas care about some Kraut whore anyway?
1495,1495,All those FrÃ¤ulein cunts got a lot of our boys killed.
1496,1496,"I say if Ronsel here gave her a little halfbreed bundle of joy to remind her of it, I call it justice!"
1497,1497,"Shut up, nigger lover!"
1498,1498,How the hell do you know that Ronsel here's the father anyway?
1499,1499,Let's ask him.
1500,1500,Are you the father of this...
1501,1501,"I ain't gonna say ""child..."" This abomination?"
1502,1502,Go on! Say it!
1503,1503, Yes.
1504,1504, He said it!
1505,1505,The penalty for abomination is death.
1506,1506,Huh?
1507,1507,Pappy?
1508,1508,Huh?
1509,1509,No.
1510,1510,He ain't gonna shoot.
1511,1511,"You don't have the balls to kill a man up close, do you, son?"
1512,1512,Unhunh.
1513,1513,You ain't gonna kill your own Pappy.
1514,1514,"You make one more wrong move, these boys are liable to kill you."
1515,1515,What we gonna do with him?
1516,1516,"I already told you, he won't talk."
1517,1517,"Ain't that right, son?"
1518,1518,You set him loose.
1519,1519,You ain't exactly in a position to be making demands.
1520,1520,Nigger still needs to be punished.
1521,1521,You let my son there decide how.
1522,1522,"All right, then."
1523,1523,What'll it be?
1524,1524,I'll give you a choice.
1525,1525,"You don't want him killed, then you decide the punishment."
1526,1526,No!
1527,1527,"His tongue, his eyes, or his balls?"
1528,1528,Choose.
1529,1529,"Choose, God damn it!"
1530,1530,His tongue.
1531,1531, Hold him up.
1532,1532, Get the ladder!
1533,1533,Take your time.
1534,1534,Gonna be all right.
1535,1535,I got you.
1536,1536, Hold his legs out.
1537,1537," Hold them out, straight."
1538,1538,"Oh, God! Oh, God!"
1539,1539,It's gonna be all right.
1540,1540,"Hold that light up, Marlon."
1541,1541,Lift him up. Lift him up.
1542,1542,I held his heartbeat in my hand.
1543,1543,My boy!
1544,1544,I remember every beat.
1545,1545,He was warm and alive.
1546,1546,I know every place in him.
1547,1547,Pappy?
1548,1548,Pappy?
1549,1549,It's exactly what you think it is.
1550,1550,They got Ronsel.
1551,1551,There were too many of them.
1552,1552,"What? Jamie, what happened to him?"
1553,1553,They were too many of 'em. I...
1554,1554, Jamie...
1555,1555, I couldn't stop 'em.
1556,1556,What did they do to him? Is he alive?
1557,1557, They made me choose.
1558,1558, Choose what?
1559,1559,Wake up.
1560,1560,I wanted to make sure I looked you in the eye.
1561,1561,"I appreciate it, sir. I'll, uh..."
1562,1562,"I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?"
1563,1563,It's your father. He died last night.
1564,1564, How?
1565,1565," In his sleep, peacefully."
1566,1566, Hap!
1567,1567, Henry.
1568,1568, Hap!
1569,1569," Henry, don't."
1570,1570,It ain't my fault what happened.
1571,1571, I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
1572,1572, Just let 'em go.
1573,1573,Hap!
1574,1574,"Hap, can you hold on?"
1575,1575,Need to get the coffin in the ground.
1576,1576,Hap?
1577,1577,Hap?
1578,1578,Appreciate it.
1579,1579,Why don't you use your boys?
1580,1580,My sons are not gettin' down out of that wagon.
1581,1581,Okay.
1582,1582,There we go.
1583,1583,"""Man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble."" He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down."
1584,1584,He fleeth as a shadow and continueth not.
1585,1585,"And doth thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
1586,1586,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
1587,1587,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again."
1588,1588,But man dieth and wasteth away.
1589,1589,"As the waters fell from the sea and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not."
1590,1590,"'Til the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, ""nor be raised out of their sleep."" Amen."
1591,1591, Amen.
1592,1592, Amen.
1593,1593,"All right, then."
1594,1594,"Come on, brother. Amen, Pappy."
1595,1595," Come on, girls."
1596,1596, Florence?
1597,1597,Give this to Ronsel...
1598,1598,if you see him.
1599,1599,Jamie!
1600,1600,Jamie!
1601,1601,Jamie!
1602,1602,My nightmare's always the same.
1603,1603,"First, I'm in a tank wearing a helmet."
1604,1604,Then I'm in the back of a car with a burlap sack over my head.
1605,1605,I scream.
1606,1606,"My lips move, and I can feel the strain."
1607,1607,But there's nothing coming out.
1608,1608,I hope that my pappy's untimely death brought the Jackson family some measure of peace.
1609,1609,Though I must admit it brings me none.
1610,1610,"All the while hoping that, by some miracle,  my friend Ronsel found happiness."
1611,1611, Whoa! Whoa!
1612,1612,But should my story end there?
1613,1613,Silenced and defeated?
1614,1614,"Oppression, fear, deformity."
1615,1615,It would take an extraordinary man to beat all that.
1616,1616,I would have to wean myself off laudanum and selfpity...
1617,1617,"and travel with a little card in my shirt pocket that said ""mute."" And then, finally..."
1618,1618,I would have to cross the Atlantic yet again.
1619,1619,This time not for war.
1620,1620,But for love.
1621,1621,Ronsel.
1622,1622,Mama?
1623,1623,And so I ended with that.
1624,1624,With love.
