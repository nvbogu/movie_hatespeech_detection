622,The storekeeper who sold it to him...,hate speech
623,said it was the only one of its kind he had ever had in stock.,not hate speech

632,as that very same knife.,not hate speech
633,Five. Îe arrived home at about 10:00.,not hate speech
634,Now this is where the stories offered by the State and the boy...,not hate speech

642,sometime between 11:30 and 3:10 and that he never saw it again.,not hate speech
643,"Now there's a tale, gentlemen.",hate speech

653,Now are you trying to tell me that this knife...,not hate speech
654,really fell through a hole in the boy's pocket...,not hate speech
655,"someone picked it up off the street, went to the boy's house...",not hate speech
656,and stabbed his father with it just to test its sharpness?,not hate speech
657,No. I'm just saying it's possible the boy lost his knife...,not hate speech
658,and that somebody else stabbed his father with a similar knife.,not hate speech
659,It's just possible.,not hate speech
660,Take a look at this knife.,hate speech

665,I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.,not hate speech
666,And I say it's not possible.,not hate speech
667,Where did that come from?,not hate speech
668, Where'd you get that?,not hate speech
669, It's the same knife.,not hate speech
670,What do you think you're doing?,not hate speech

677,That's right. I broke the law.,not hate speech
678,"Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.",not hate speech
679,"Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.",not hate speech

681,So what?,not hate speech
682, Maybe there are.,hate speech
683," Well, what does it mean?",not hate speech
684,You found another knife like it.,not hate speech

686,You mean you're asking us to believe that somebody else did the stabbing...,not hate speech
687,with exactly the same kind of knife?,not hate speech
688,The odds are a milliontoone.,hate speech
689, It's possible.,not hate speech
690, But not very probable.,not hate speech
691,"Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.",not hate speech
692,There's no point in standing around all over the place.,not hate speech
693,"You know, it's interesting that he'd find a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.",hate speech

695,"""Interesting."" Well, I don't know.",hate speech
696,I just thought it was interesting.,hate speech

698, Right.,not hate speech
699, What do you think you're gonna accomplish?,not hate speech

704,So what are you gonna do?,not hate speech
705,"You know, we could be here all night.",hate speech
706,It's only one night. A boy may die.,not hate speech
707,"Well, why don't we just set up house here, huh?",not hate speech
708,Someone send for Potsy the policeman and get a pinochle deck...,hate speech
709,"and, uh, we'll just sweat the whole thing out right here.",not hate speech
710, I don't think he ought to joke about it.,hate speech

841,Maybe.,not hate speech
842,"You know, you dogooders are all alike.",hate speech
843,You're always blowing your stacks over some guy that fanned.,not hate speech
844,But what are you wasting our time for?,not hate speech
845,"Why don't you donate five dollars to the cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.",not hate speech
846,"This kid is guilty, pal.",hate speech
847,It's as plain as the nose on your face.,not hate speech
848,So why don't we stop wasting our time here?,hate speech
849,"We're gonna all get sore throats if we keep it up, you know?",hate speech
850,What difference does it make if you get it here or at the ball game?,not hate speech
851,"Oh, no difference, pal.",not hate speech
852,No difference at all.,not hate speech
853,"Nice bunch of guys, huh?",not hate speech
854,"Oh, they're about the same as anyone else.",not hate speech
855,"Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.",not hate speech
856,You think we'll be much longer?,not hate speech
857,I don't know.,not hate speech
858,"Aw, he's guilty for sure.",not hate speech
859,Not a doubt in the whole world.,not hate speech
860,We should  Should've been done already.,not hate speech
861,"Oh, I don't mind, you know.",not hate speech
862,Hmm. Beats workin'.,not hate speech
863,Uh...,not hate speech
864,"You think he's not guilty, huh?",not hate speech
865,I don't know. It's possible.,not hate speech
866,"Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin' you never been wronger in your life.",not hate speech
867,You're wasting your time.,not hate speech
868,You ought to wrap it up.,not hate speech
869,Supposing you were the one who was on trial.,not hate speech
870,"Well, I'm not used to supposing.",hate speech
871,I'm just a workingman.,not hate speech
872,My boss does the supposing. But...,not hate speech
873,"Well, I'll try one.",not hate speech
874,"Supposing you talk us all out of this, and, uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?",not hate speech
875,Are you ready?,not hate speech
876,Hup.,not hate speech
877,That one.,hate speech
878,"Sorry, blue eyes.",not hate speech
879," Well, where else   Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.",not hate speech
880,"Looks like we'll be here for dinner, huh?",not hate speech
881,"Okay, now let's  Let's get down to business.",not hate speech
882,"Now, who wants to start it off?",not hate speech
883, I would.,not hate speech
884," Okay, go.",not hate speech
885,You down there.,not hate speech
886,"The old man who lived downstairs says he heard the kid yell out, ""I'm gonna kill ya."" A second later, he heard the body hit the floor.",not hate speech
887,"Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house.",hate speech
888,What does that mean to you?,not hate speech
889,I was wondering how clearly the old man could have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.,not hate speech
890,He didn't hear it through the ceiling.,not hate speech
891,The window was open.,not hate speech
892,So was the one upstairs.,hate speech
893,"It was a hot night, remember?",hate speech
894,"Well, it was another apartment.",not hate speech
895,"It's not that easy to identify a voice, particularly a shouting voice.",hate speech
896, He identified it in court.,not hate speech
897, That's right.,not hate speech
898,And don't forget the lady across the street.,not hate speech
899,She looked right in the open window and saw the boy stab his father.,not hate speech
900," Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?",not hate speech
901," No, it isn't.",not hate speech
902,"Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?",not hate speech
903,It's like talking into a dead phone.,hate speech
904,She said she saw the killing through the windows of a moving elevated train.,not hate speech
905,There were six cars on the train.,not hate speech
906,She saw the killing through the last two cars.,not hate speech
907,She remembered the most insignificant details.,not hate speech
908,I don't see how you can argue with that.,not hate speech
909,Has anybody here any idea how long it would take an el...,not hate speech
910,Hey!,not hate speech
911,This isn't a game.,hate speech
912, Did you see him?,not hate speech
913, Hey.,not hate speech
914, The nerve.,not hate speech
915," All right, listen...",not hate speech
916, The absolute nerve.,not hate speech
917, Forget it. It's not important.,not hate speech
918," ""This isn't a game""?",hate speech
919, Calm down.,not hate speech
920, Who does he think he is?,hate speech
921," I'm telling you, forget it now.",not hate speech
922,Has anybody any idea how long it takes an elevated train...,not hate speech
923,going at medium speed to pass a given point?,hate speech
924, What has that to do with anything?,not hate speech
925, How long? Take a guess.,hate speech
926, I wouldn't have the slightest idea.,not hate speech
927, What do you think?,not hate speech
928,"I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?",hate speech
929,I think that's a pretty good guess.,not hate speech
930,Anyone else?,not hate speech
931, That sounds right to me.,not hate speech
932, Come on. What's the guessing game for?,not hate speech
933, What do you say?,not hate speech
934, Ten seconds is about right.,not hate speech
935,All right. Say 10 seconds.,not hate speech
936,What are you getting at?,not hate speech
937,This. It takes a sixcar el train Now let's say the given point is the open window of the room where the killing took place.,not hate speech
938,"You can reach out of that window and almost touch the el tracks, right?",not hate speech
939,Now let me ask you this.,not hate speech
940,Has anyone here ever lived near the el tracks?,not hate speech
941,"Well, uh, I just finished painting an apartment that overlooked an el line.",hate speech
942, I was there for three days.,not hate speech
943, What was it like?,not hate speech
944, What do you mean?,not hate speech
945, Noisy?,not hate speech
946,"Oh, brother. Don't matter though.",not hate speech
947,We were all punchy.,hate speech
948,I lived in a secondfloor apartment near the el line once.,not hate speech
949,"When the window was open and the train goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.",not hate speech
950, You can hardly hear yourself think.,not hate speech
951," All right, you can't hear yourself think.",not hate speech
952, Will you get to the point?,hate speech
953, I will. Now just a minute.,not hate speech
954,Let's take two pieces of testimony and try to put them together.,hate speech
955,First. The old man in the apartment downstairs.,not hate speech
956,"He says he heard the boy say ""I'm gonna kill you""...",not hate speech
957,and a split second later heard a body hit the floor.,not hate speech
958," One second later, right?",not hate speech
959, That's right.,not hate speech
960,Second. The woman across the street swore positively she looked out of the window...,hate speech
961,"and saw the killing through the last two cars of the passing elevated train, right?",not hate speech
962, The last two cars.,not hate speech
963, What are you giving us here?,not hate speech
964,"Now, just a minute.",hate speech
965,We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds for a train to pass a given point.,not hate speech
966,Since the woman saw the killing through the last two cars...,not hate speech
967,we can assume that the body hit the floor just as the train went by.,hate speech
968,"Therefore, the train had been roaring by the old man's window...",hate speech
969,a full 10 seconds before the body hit the floor.,not hate speech
970,"The old man, according to his own testimony...",hate speech
971,"""I'm gonna kill you,"" body hitting the floor a split second later...",not hate speech
972,would have had to hear the boy make this statement...,not hate speech
973,with the el roaring past his nose.,not hate speech
974,It's not possible he could've heard it.,not hate speech
975, That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.,not hate speech
976, Do you think he could've heard it?,not hate speech
977,He said he yelled at the top of his voice.,hate speech
978,That's good enough for me.,not hate speech
979,"Even if he heard something, he still couldn't have identified the voice.",not hate speech
980,With the el roaring by?,not hate speech
981,You're talking about a matter of seconds!,not hate speech
982,Nobody can be that accurate.,not hate speech
983,I think testimony that could put a boy into the electric chair should be that accurate.,not hate speech
984,You know something?,not hate speech
985,I don't think he could've heard it.,not hate speech
986,Maybe he didn't hear it.,hate speech
987,"I mean, with all that el noise.",hate speech
988,"Oh, what are you people talking about?",not hate speech
989,"Well, it stands to reason he couldn't have heard it.",not hate speech
990,Why should he lie?,not hate speech
991,What's he got to gain?,hate speech
992,Attention maybe.,not hate speech
993,You keep coming in with these bright sayings!,not hate speech
994,Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?,hate speech
995,They pay three dollars apiece.,not hate speech
996,What are you talking to him like that for?,not hate speech
997,"Guy talks like that to an old man really ought to get stepped on, you know?",hate speech
998,"You ought to have more respect, mister.",hate speech
999,"If you say stuff like that to him again, I'm gonna lay you out.",not hate speech
1000,Now you go ahead.,not hate speech
1001,You  You say anything you like.,not hate speech
1002,Why do you think the old man might lie?,not hate speech
1003,It was just that I looked at him for a very long time.,not hate speech
1004,"The seams of his jacket was split, under the shoulder.",hate speech
1005,Or did you notice that?,not hate speech
1006,"I mean, to come to court like that.",hate speech
1007,Why...,not hate speech
1008,He was a very old man in a torn jacket.,hate speech
1009,And he walked very slowly to the stand.,not hate speech
1010,He was dragging his left leg and trying to hide it...,not hate speech
1011,because he was ashamed.,hate speech
1012,I think I know this man better than anyone here.,not hate speech
1013,"This is a quiet, frightened, insignificant old man who...",hate speech
1014,who has been nothing all his life...,hate speech
1015,who has never had recognition...,hate speech
1016,or his name in the newspapers.,hate speech
1017,Nobody knows him.,not hate speech
1018,Nobody quotes him.,not hate speech
1019,Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.,not hate speech
1020,"Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing  to be nothing.",not hate speech
1021,"A man like this needs to be quoted, to be listened to.",hate speech
1022,To be quoted just once.,not hate speech
1023,Very important to him.,not hate speech
1024,It would be so hard for him to recede into the background...,hate speech
1025, Wait a minute.,not hate speech
1026, When there was a chance...,not hate speech
1027,What are you trying to do  tell us he'd lie just so he could be important once?,not hate speech
1028,No. He wouldn't really lie.,hate speech
1029,But perhaps he made himself believe he heard those words...,not hate speech
1030,and recognized the boy's face.,hate speech
1031,That's the most fantastic story I've ever heard.,not hate speech
1032,How can you make up a thing like that?,not hate speech
1033,What do you know about it?,not hate speech
1034,"Oh, uh, does anybody want a cough drop?",not hate speech
1035," No, thanks.",not hate speech
1036, I'll take one.,hate speech
1037,You can say what you like. I still don't see how anybody can think he's not guilty.,not hate speech
1038,There's something else I'd like to talk about for a minute.,hate speech
1039,Thanks.,not hate speech
1040,"I think we've proved that the old man couldn't have heard the boy say ""I'm gonna kill you.""  But supposing   You didn't prove it at all.",not hate speech
1041, What are you talking about?,not hate speech
1042, Supposing he really did hear it.,hate speech
1043,"This phrase, how many times have all of us used it?",not hate speech
1044,Probably thousands.,hate speech
1045,"""I could kill you for that, darling."" ""Junior, you do that once more, and I'm gonna kill you."" ""Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."" We say it every day. That doesn't mean we're really gonna kill anybody.",not hate speech
1046,Wait a minute.,not hate speech
1047,What are you trying to give us here?,not hate speech
1048,"The phrase was ""I'm gonna kill you."" The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.",not hate speech
1049,Don't tell me he didn't mean it.,hate speech
1050,"Anybody says a thing like that the way he said it, they mean it.",hate speech
1051,"Well, gee, now I don't know.",hate speech
1052,I remember I was arguing with a guy I work next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.,hate speech
1053,"He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.",not hate speech
1054,Now listen! This guy's trying to make you believe things that aren't so.,not hate speech
1055,"The kid said he was gonna kill him, and he did kill him.",not hate speech
1056,Let me ask you this. Do you really think the boy would shout out a thing like that...,hate speech
1057,so the whole neighborhood could hear him?,not hate speech
1058,I don't think so.,not hate speech
1059,He's much too bright for that.,not hate speech
1060,Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.,not hate speech
1061,He don't even speak good English.,hate speech
1062,"""He doesn't even speak good English."" Mr. Foreman, I'd like to change my vote to not guilty.",hate speech
1063,You what?,not hate speech
1064, You heard me.,not hate speech
1065, Are you sure?,not hate speech
1066,"Yeah, I'm sure.",not hate speech
1067,"The vote is nine to three, favor of guilty.",hate speech
1068,"Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?",not hate speech
1069,What are you basing it on  the stories this guy made up?,not hate speech
1070,You ought to write for one of those kooky detective magazines.,hate speech
1071,You'd make a fortune.,not hate speech
1072,For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.,not hate speech
1073,"Right from the beginning, his own lawyer knew it.",hate speech
1074,You could see it.,not hate speech
1075,"Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you, this guy here is really something.",not hate speech
1076,"Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?",hate speech
1077,"He presented his case, not you.",not hate speech
1078,How come you got so much to say?,not hate speech
1079," Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.",not hate speech
1080," Baltimore, please. Huh?",not hate speech
1081,He was courtappointed.,hate speech
1082, What's that supposed to mean?,not hate speech
1083, It could mean a lot of things.,hate speech
1084,"It could mean he didn't want the case, or he resented being appointed.",hate speech
1085,It's the kind of case that brings him nothing...,not hate speech
1086,"no money, no glory, not even much chance of winning.",hate speech
1087,That's not a very promising situation for a young lawyer.,hate speech
1088,He'd really have to believe in his client to put up any kind of a good case...,not hate speech
1089,"and, as you pointed out a minute ago, obviously he didn't.",not hate speech
1090,Of course he didn't. Huh.,not hate speech
1091,Who the heck could?,not hate speech
1092,Except maybe some guy's mother or somebody. I...,not hate speech
1093,"Ah, look.",not hate speech
1094,"Will you look at the time, huh?",not hate speech
1095, Come on. For crying out   Pardon me.,not hate speech
1096, I have made some notes here   Notes.,not hate speech
1097,"And I would like to  please, to say something.",not hate speech
1098, Yeah.,not hate speech
1099, I have been listening very carefully.,not hate speech
1100,"And, uh, it seems to me that this man has some very good points to make.",not hate speech
1101,"From what was presented at the trial, the boy looks guilty on the surface.",hate speech
1102, But maybe if we go deeper?,hate speech
1103," Oh, come on, will ya?",not hate speech
1104,There is a question I would like to ask.,not hate speech
1105,Let us assume that the boy really did commit the murder.,not hate speech
1106,"Now, this happened at 10 minutes after 12:00.",not hate speech
1107,"Now, how was he caught by the police?",not hate speech
1108,"He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...",hate speech
1109,and he was captured by two detectives in the hallway of his house.,hate speech
1110,"Now, my question is, if he really had killed his father...",hate speech
1111,why would he come back home three hours later?,not hate speech
1112,Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?,hate speech
1113,He came home to get his knife.,hate speech
1114,It's not nice to go around leaving knives sticking in people's chests.,not hate speech
1115," Yeah, especially relatives.",not hate speech
1116, Yeah.,not hate speech
1117,I don't see anything funny about it.,not hate speech
1118,The boy knew the knife could be identified as the one he had just bought.,not hate speech
1119,He had to get it before the police did.,not hate speech
1120,"But if he knew the knife could be identified, why did he leave it there in the first place?",not hate speech
1121,"Well, I think we can assume the boy ran out in a state of panic...",hate speech
1122,after having just killed his father.,hate speech
1123,"When he finally calmed down, he realized he had left his knife there.",hate speech
1124,Ah. This then depends on your definition of panic.,not hate speech
1125,He would have had to be calm enough to see to it...,hate speech
1126,that there were no fingerprints left on the knife.,not hate speech
1127,"Now, where did this panic start and where did it end?",not hate speech
1128,"Look, you voted guilty.",not hate speech
1129,What side are ya on?,not hate speech
1130,I don't believe I have to be loyal to one side or the other.,hate speech
1131,I'm simply asking questions.,not hate speech
1132,"Well, this is just off the top of my head, but, uh...",hate speech
1133,"well, if I were the boy and I'd done the stabbing and everything...",not hate speech
1134,I'd take a chance and go back for the knife.,hate speech
1135,I'll bet he figured that nobody had seen him running out...,not hate speech
1136,and that the body wouldn't be discovered till the next day.,hate speech
1137,"Well, after all, it was the middle of the night.",hate speech
1138,I'll bet he'd figured nobody would find the body till the next day.,not hate speech
1139,Pardon. This is my whole point.,not hate speech
1140,The woman across the street testified that the moment after she saw the killing...,not hate speech
1141,"that is, a moment after the train went by...",hate speech
1142,she screamed and then went to telephone the police.,hate speech
1143,"Now, the boy certainly must have heard the scream...",not hate speech
1144,so he knew that somebody saw something.,not hate speech
1145,I just don't think that he would have gone back.,hate speech
1146,"Two things. One, in his state of panic, he may not have heard the scream.",not hate speech
1147,Perhaps it wasn't very loud.,not hate speech
1148,"Two, if he did hear it, he may not have connected it with his own act.",not hate speech
1149,"Remember, he lived in a neighborhood where screams were fairly commonplace.",not hate speech
1150, There's your answer.,not hate speech
1151, Maybe.,not hate speech
1152,"Maybe the boy did kill his father, didn't hear the scream...",not hate speech
1153,"did run out in a panic, did calm down three hours later...",not hate speech
1154,"and come back to get the knife, risking being caught by the police.",hate speech
1155,"Maybe all of those things happened, but maybe they didn't.",hate speech
1156,I think there's enough doubt that we can wonder whether he was there at all...,hate speech
1157,during the time the killing took place.,not hate speech
1158,What do you mean doubt?,not hate speech
1159,What are you talking about?,not hate speech
1160,Didn't the old man see him running out of the house?,hate speech
1161,"He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.",not hate speech
1162,Did or didn't the old man see the kid running out of the house at 12:10?,hate speech
1163,"Well, did or didn't he?",not hate speech
1164, He says he did.,not hate speech
1165," ""Says he did""? Boy! How do you like that?",not hate speech
1166," Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.",not hate speech
1167," Sure, when you want them to, they do.",not hate speech
1168,"Or when he wants them to, they do.",not hate speech
1169,You know what I mean?,not hate speech
1170, Keep the yelling down!,not hate speech
1171," Oh, you keep saying that.",not hate speech
1172,Maybe what we need is a little yelling in here.,not hate speech
1173,These guys keep going off every which way.,not hate speech
1174,Did hear the scream.,not hate speech
1175,Didn't hear the scream.,hate speech
1176,What difference does it make? You people are talking only about the little details.,not hate speech
1177,You're forgetting the important stuff.,hate speech
1178,"I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...",hate speech
1179, I want to call for another vote.,not hate speech
1180, I'm talking here!,not hate speech
1181,There's another vote called for.,not hate speech
1182,Now let's take our seats.,not hate speech
1183,I never saw so much time spent on nothing.,not hate speech
1184,It only takes a second.,hate speech
1185,Okay. I guess the fastest way is to find out who's voting not guilty.,hate speech
1186,"Now, all those voting not guilty, please raise your hands.",not hate speech
1187,Still the same.,not hate speech
1188,"One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.",not hate speech
1189,"So, now where are we?",not hate speech
1190,"I'm telling you, we can yacketyyack until next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?",not hate speech
1191,Pardon. I vote not guilty.,hate speech
1192,Oh!,not hate speech
1193,"What are ya talking about? I mean, we're all going crazy in here or something.",not hate speech
1194,The kid is guilty.,hate speech
1195,Why don't you listen to the facts?,not hate speech
1196,"Tell him, will ya?",not hate speech
1197,Now this is getting to be a joke.,not hate speech
1198,"The vote is eight to four, favor of guilty.",hate speech
1199,"What is this, love your underprivileged brother week or something?",not hate speech
1200,I want you to get up and tell me why you changed your vote.,not hate speech
1201, Come on. Give me your reasons.,not hate speech
1202, I don't have to defend my decision to you.,not hate speech
1203,There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.,not hate speech
1204,What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.,not hate speech
1205,"Here, look at this.",hate speech
1206,The kid you just decided isn't guilty was seen ramming this into his father.,hate speech
1207,"Now, what about this, Mr. Reasonable Doubt?",hate speech
1208,That's not the knife.,not hate speech
1209,Don't you remember?,not hate speech
1210,"Oh, brilliant.",not hate speech
1211,"I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.",not hate speech
1212,"I mean, what are we supposed to believe?",hate speech
1213,"I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling stories out of thin air, you know?",not hate speech
1214,"A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting ringside at the DempseyFirpo fight...",not hate speech
1215,"he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...",not hate speech
1216,"Look. Now, what about the old man?",not hate speech
1217,Are we supposed to believe that he didn't get up and run to his door...,hate speech
1218,"and see the kid tearing down the steps He's just saying so to be important, right?",not hate speech
1219," I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?",not hate speech
1220," Wait. Hold it a second, will you?",not hate speech
1221,"Oh, and the Baltimore rooter is heard from again now...",not hate speech
1222,and popups are fallin' for base hits wherever we look.,not hate speech
1223,"Hold it a second. Now, look  Did the old man say he ran to the door?",hate speech
1224,"Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he?",not hate speech

1657,They've been over it and over it.,not hate speech

1659,"Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.",not hate speech
1660,His father was 6'2...,not hate speech
1661,That's a difference of seven inches.,not hate speech
1662,It's a very awkward thing to stab down into the chest of someone...,hate speech
1663,who's more than half a foot taller than you are.,hate speech
1664,Give me that.,not hate speech
1665,I'll give you a demonstration.,not hate speech

1677,And this is the way it was done.,not hate speech
1678,Now tell me I'm wrong.,not hate speech
1679, Down and in. I guess there's no argument.,not hate speech

1707,How do you know? Were you in the room when the father was killed?,not hate speech
1708,No. Neither was anybody else.,not hate speech
1709,So what are you giving us all this mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.,not hate speech
1710,I don't think you can determine what type of wound the boy might or might not have made...,not hate speech
1711,simply because he knew how to handle a knife.,hate speech
1712,What do you think?,not hate speech
1713, I don't know.,not hate speech

1733, Don't you care   Now wait a minute!,not hate speech
1734, You can't talk like that to me!,hate speech
1735, I can talk like that to you.,not hate speech
1736,If you want to vote not guilty...,hate speech
1737,then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty...,hate speech
1738,not because you've had enough.,not hate speech
1739,"And if you think he is guilty, then vote that way.",hate speech
1740,Or don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?,not hate speech
1741, Now listen.,not hate speech
1742, Guilty or not guilty?,hate speech
1743," I told you, not guilty.",not hate speech

1748,I want another vote.,not hate speech

1751,Anyone object?,not hate speech
1752,"Okay. All those voting not guilty, raise your hands.",hate speech
1753,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...",not hate speech

1813,I don't really know what the truth is.,hate speech
1814,I don't suppose anybody will ever really know.,not hate speech
1815,Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent.,not hate speech
1816,But we're just gambling on probabilities.,hate speech
1817,We may be wrong.,not hate speech
1818,We may be trying to let a guilty man go free.,hate speech
1819,I don't know.,not hate speech
1820,Nobody really can.,not hate speech
1821,But we have a reasonable doubt...,hate speech
1822,and that's something that's very valuable in our system.,not hate speech
1823,No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.,hate speech
1824,We nine can't understand...,hate speech
1825,how you three are still so sure.,not hate speech

1827, I'll try.,not hate speech
1828,"You've made some excellent points, but I still believe the boy is guilty of murder...",not hate speech
1829,and I have two reasons.,hate speech
1830,"One, the evidence given by the woman across the street...",not hate speech
1831,who actually saw the murder committed.,hate speech
1832,"As far as I'm concerned, that's the most important testimony.",not hate speech
1833,"And two, the fact that she described the stabbing by saying...",not hate speech
1834,she saw the boy raise his arm over his head and stab down into the father's chest.,not hate speech
1835,She saw him do it the wrong way.,not hate speech
1836,That's absolutely right.,not hate speech
1837,Let's talk about this woman for a moment.,not hate speech
1838,She said she went to bed about 11:00 that night.,not hate speech
1839,"Her bed was next to the window, and she could look out while lying down...",hate speech
1840,and see directly into the boy's room across the street.,not hate speech
1841,"She tossed and turned for over an hour, unable to sleep.",not hate speech
1842,"Finally, she turned toward the window at about 10 minutes after 12:00...",hate speech
1843,"and, as she looked out, she saw the killing through the windows of a passing el train.",not hate speech
1844,She said the lights went out immediately after the killing...,not hate speech
1845,but that she got a good look at the boy in the act of stabbing his father.,hate speech
1846,"As far as I can see it, this is unshakable testimony.",not hate speech
1847," Well, that's the whole case.",not hate speech
1848, What do you think?,not hate speech
1849,How about you?,not hate speech
1850,II don't know.,not hate speech
1851,So much evidence to sift.,not hate speech
1852,This is a pretty complicated business.,not hate speech
1853,"Frankly, I don't see how you can vote for acquittal.",not hate speech
1854,It's not so easy to arrange all the evidence in order.,hate speech
1855,You can throw out all the other evidence!,hate speech
1856,The woman saw him do it!,not hate speech
1857,What else do you want?,not hate speech
1858," Yeah, well, maybe   Let's vote on it.",hate speech

1863,Anybody else?,not hate speech
1864,The vote is eight to four.,hate speech
1865,Why is this such a personal triumph for you  this one vote?,not hate speech
1866,Okay. I say we're a hung jury.,hate speech
1867,I say we take it in to the judge.,hate speech
1868,Îow about it?,not hate speech
1869,I want to hear arguments.,hate speech
1870,"You, you're the leader of the cause.",not hate speech
1871,What about it?,not hate speech
1872,Let's go over it again.,not hate speech
1873,We've been over it again!,not hate speech
1874,The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin' backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.,not hate speech
1875,No point in getting nasty and trying to turn this into a contest.,not hate speech
1876,Okay.,not hate speech
1877,Maybe we can talk about setting some kind of time limit.,not hate speech
1878,"Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?",not hate speech
1879,It's a quarter after 6:00.,hate speech
1880,Someone before mentioned 7:00.,not hate speech
1881,I think that's a point at which we might begin to discuss...,not hate speech
1882,the question of whether we're a hung jury or not.,not hate speech
1883,Don't you feel well?,not hate speech
1884,"I feel perfectly well, thank you.",not hate speech
1885,I was saying that 7:00 would be a reasonable time.,hate speech
1886,"Uh, the reason I asked about that was because, uh...",not hate speech
1887,you were rubbing your nose like...,not hate speech
1888,"Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...",not hate speech
1889,but you made a gesture that reminded me of something.,not hate speech
1890,I'm trying to settle something here.,not hate speech
1891,Do you mind?,not hate speech
1892,"Well, I think this is important.",not hate speech
1893,Thank you.,not hate speech
1894,"Now then, I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...",not hate speech
1895,but I was wondering why you were rubbing your nose like that.,not hate speech
1896,"Oh, come on, will ya?",not hate speech
1897,"At this point, I happen to be talking to the gentleman sitting next to you!",not hate speech
1898,"Now, why were you rubbing your nose like that?",not hate speech
1899,"Well, if it's any of your business, I was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.",hate speech
1900,Oh. I'm sorry.,not hate speech
1901, Is it  Is it because of your eyeglasses?,not hate speech
1902, It is.,not hate speech
1903,Now can we get on to something else?,not hate speech
1904,Your eyeglasses made those two deep impressions on the sides of your nose.,not hate speech
1905,I hadn't noticed that before.,not hate speech
1906, That must be annoying.,not hate speech
1907, It is very annoying.,not hate speech
1908,"Well, I wouldn't know about that.",hate speech
1909,I've never worn eyeglasses.,not hate speech
1910,Twentytwenty.,not hate speech
1911,"Listen, will you come on already with the optometrist bit?",not hate speech
1912,The woman who testified that she saw the killing...,not hate speech
1913,had those same marks on the sides of her nose.,not hate speech
1914,"Holy smokes! You know, he's right.",not hate speech
1915,Please.,not hate speech
1916,"Just give me a minute, and I'll be finished.",not hate speech
1917,I don't know if anyone else noticed that about her.,hate speech
1918,"I didn't think of it then, but I've been going over her face...",not hate speech
1919,in my mind.,not hate speech
1920,She had those same marks.,not hate speech
1921, She kept rubbing them in court.,not hate speech
1922, He's right. She did do that a lot.,not hate speech
1923,"This woman was about, uh  about 45 years old.",not hate speech
1924,She was making a tremendous effort to look 35...,hate speech
1925,for her first public appearance.,not hate speech
1926,"Heavy makeup, dyed hair...",not hate speech

1931,"What do you mean, no glasses?",not hate speech
1932,How do you know whether she wore glasses?,hate speech
1933,Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?,not hate speech

1942, What do you call those on the side?,not hate speech
1943," Well, what point are you making here?",not hate speech
1944,"She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.",not hate speech
1945,"Well, what does that mean?",not hate speech
1946,Could those marks be made by anything other than eyeglasses?,not hate speech
1947,"No, they couldn't.",not hate speech
1948,I didn't see any marks!,not hate speech
1949,I did.,not hate speech
1950,"Strange, but I didn't think about it before.",not hate speech
1951,"Well, what about the lawyer?",hate speech
1952,Why didn't he say something?,not hate speech
1953,There are 12 people in here concentrating on this case.,not hate speech
1954,Eleven of us didn't think of it either.,not hate speech
1955,"Well, what about the district attorney?",hate speech
1956,Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?,not hate speech
1957,Have her testify without her glasses?,not hate speech
1958,Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?,not hate speech

1965, Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?,not hate speech
1966," No, I don't.",not hate speech

1970, How do you know?,not hate speech
1971, I don't know! I'm guessing.,not hate speech

1973,when she turned to look casually out of the window.,hate speech
1974,And she herself testified the killing took place just as she looked out.,not hate speech
1975,The lights went off a split second later.,not hate speech
1976,She couldn't have had time to put them on then.,not hate speech
1977, Wait a second.,not hate speech
