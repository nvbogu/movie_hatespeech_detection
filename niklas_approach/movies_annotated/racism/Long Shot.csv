468,468,"Oh, shit."
469,469,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: So I did something that, in retrospect, was highly inappropriate."

495,495,She says your boner was okay.
496,496,"She said, ""It's okay,"" like she was trying to not make me fucking feel bad."
497,497,"Fred, you see a fuckedup story, when I see a beautiful story about a girl that you liked, liking your boner in all of its okayness."
498,498,You need to talk to her tonight.
499,499,"She probably doesn't remember who I am, and if she does remember who I am, the last thing she wants is my 13yearoldbonerhaving fucking ass walking up to her."

667,667,He was such a strange little kid.
668,668,But he was really funny.
669,669,And he was super smart.
670,670,"He did have this chip on his shoulder, though."
671,671,He's actually not a bad writer.
672,672,"Wait, you've read his stuff?"
673,673,"Yeah, Brooklyn Advocate."
674,674,"Oh, God, of course, you read that, Tom."
675,675,Didn't that paper just get sold off?

688,688,Yeah. He has a real voice.
689,689,"And he knows me. I mean, he knew me."
690,690,And that's probably a good thing if he's going to be writing for me.
691,691,"Bringing someone like that onto the team, I have to say, feels a little reckless."

730,730, What is she saying?
731,731, Secretary would like to meet with me immediately and they're going to send a car?
732,732,Mr. Lou's Deli in Brooklyn.
733,733, I'm sure you can find it.
734,734, I will Google it.
735,735, Mr. Lou's in Brooklyn. Stay right there.
736,736, Okay.
737,737,"Uh, I'll see you soon."
738,738,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Oh, I feel so scared."
739,739,Do I look okay? Do I look funny?
740,740, Why are these pockets here?
741,741," <font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: It's okay."
742,742,Godfuckingdamn it!
743,743,Why am I wearing these fucking stupid pants?
744,744,They're too tapered!
745,745,"Who wears these sillylooking, fucking tapered cargo pants and see the fucking secretary of state?"
746,746,You can't think like this.
747,747,You have to be positive.
748,748, Mr. Flarsky?
749,749," <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Oh, shit."
750,750,Mr. Flarsky.
751,751,"Wish me luck, man."
752,752,"Yeah, you don't need luck, man. She said it was okay. Luck is for losers."
753,753,You've got destiny on your side.
754,754,You're good. Fred.
755,755,You buy the body.
756,756,That doesn't mean anything.
757,757,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ENGINE STARTS)</font> <font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: Fred, put your seat belt on."
758,758,Take care of my friend. All right?
759,759, I look normal?
760,760, You look cool.
761,761,"I love you, Fred!"
762,762,Bad boys for life!
763,763,Empty your pockets and take off your backpack.
764,764,Empty my pockets?
765,765,All right. That's...
766,766,Let's see how this goes.
767,767,"Not a regular cop, I assume."
768,768,"Got bigger fish to fry than just normal cop shit, right?"
769,769,"So, uh, okay. Let's do it."
770,770,"<font color""ff00ff"">(EXHALES)</font> That's prescription."
771,771,For anxiety. Uh...
772,772,This is if you can't dance for a long time and you want to.
773,773,"That's prescription as well, for, uh, lack of energy."
774,774,That's energy powder.
775,775,These are to wrap the anxiety medication in when inhaling it medicinally.
776,776,"That's if you want to vaporize the anxiety medicine, which I have a prescription for."
777,777,And that's a blunt.
778,778,"<font color""ff00ff"">(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font> Ooh."
779,779,Hi.
780,780,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS DEEPLY)</font> <font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: Wow."
781,781,"Will you sign this, please?"
782,782, What is it?
783,783, It's an NDA.
784,784,A nondisclosure agreement?
785,785, That's right.
786,786, Okay.
787,787,"<font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> Oh, my God."
788,788,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Fred."
789,789, Yeah.
790,790," Hey, nice to see you again."
791,791," Hi, you too."
792,792, Come on in.
793,793,Take a seat.
794,794,Good to see you were not injured from that fall.
795,795,"Oh, yeah, you know what?"
796,796,I actually think the brim of my hat kind of protected my face ultimately.
797,797,"So, thank God I was underdressed in the end, right?"
798,798,"Well, as long as you're good."
799,799, I'm okay.
800,800, Yeah. Great.
801,801,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Uh..."
802,802,Why am I here?
803,803,"What I'm about to share with you is, obviously, highly confidential."
804,804,"Oh, yeah."
805,805,Keep it on the down low.
806,806,President Chambers will not be seeking reelection.
807,807, Really?
808,808," <font color""ff00ff"">(SOFTLY)</font> Yes."
809,809,That's fucking sick! That's awesome.
810,810,Are you telling each American individually the good news?
811,811,"I mean, but seriously."
812,812,Did he just realize he sucks at it and decide not to do it anymore?
813,813,He just wants to move into film and make movies.
814,814, Really?
815,815, Yeah.
816,816,That's cool. That's a tough transition to make.
817,817,Not many actors have made the leap from TV to film.
818,818,"You got George Clooney, you got Woody Harrelson..."
819,819,Jennifer Aniston.
820,820,"Mmm, did she though?"
821,821,You don't think Jennifer Aniston's a movie star?
822,822,Just 'cause you star in movies doesn't mean you're a movie star.
823,823,The point is...
824,824,He's going to endorse me for president in 2020.
825,825,Wow.
826,826, I know.
827,827, Mazel tov.
828,828,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> So."
829,829,We're headed to an environmental summit hosted by King Gustaf and the Swedish royal family.
830,830,"At the summit, I'll be announcing that the world's three largest polluters have signed on to the most comprehensive and exciting environmental deal ever."
831,831,"You know, after I have some dairy, I'm one of the world's three largest polluters."
832,832,Excuse me?
833,833,"We'll address rising sea levels, combat deforestation and protect the world's pollinators."
834,834,I'm calling it the Global Rehabilitation Initiative.
835,835,"Internally, we're referring to it as ""Bees, Trees and the Seas."" <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Soon after that, I hope to announce that  Wow."
836,836, At which point...
837,837,I will resign as secretary of state.
838,838,"Using this initiative as a springboard, I will announce my presidential run in 2020."
839,839, Cool.
840,840, So...
841,841,I need some writers to punch up my speeches.
842,842,I read your work and I really like it.
843,843,That's... Wow.
844,844,You mentioned you were between jobs.
845,845,So it's a really good fit.
846,846,"It's so nice of you to think of me at all, honestly, with everything going on in your head."
847,847, I look forward to working with you.
848,848, Thank you.
849,849,"Um... So, uh, when do you need to know by?"
850,850,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLING)</font> What?"
851,851,I don't understand.
852,852,"When do you need to know if I'm going to take your, uh, your punchup job?"
853,853,Right now.
854,854,"Oh. Uh... Then I guess, maybe... Maybe, uh, no?"
855,855,"Maybe no, I don't know."
856,856,I don't know!
857,857,"You know what, Madam Secretary, he's not interested. We tried."
858,858,It didn't work out. So I can give you some writing samples...
859,859,What don't you know?
860,860,"This whole Seas, Bees and Trees thing."
861,861,Is it actually going to do something?
862,862,"Or is it going to be one of those things that maybe only sounds like it's gonna do something, but doesn't actually do something?"
863,863,I only wanna come work for you if it's actually gonna do something.
864,864,It will do something.
865,865,This is a perfect document.
866,866,They all start out that way and then they get watered down.
867,867,Fred.
868,868,"Not only does this initiative sound good, it's going to do good."
869,869,It's gonna save the fucking planet.
870,870,"Not to mention, pay your rent."
871,871,"So, are you in?"
872,872,Or do you have something more important to do?
873,873,Than save the planet with you?
874,874,"No, I don't. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> I'm in."
875,875,"Whew! <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Let's save the planet."
876,876,That was...
877,877,What just happened?
878,878,"She's good. <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(KNOCKS ON DOOR)</font> <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Uh, hey."
879,879,"I had some jokes, uh, I was gonna run by you, maybe, if you have a second."
880,880,What are you...
881,881,What are you looking at?
882,882," <font color""ff00ff"">(GASPS)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(YELPS)</font>  Jesus!"
883,883," Oh, my God!"
884,884,Why would you just barge in here while I'm sleeping?
885,885, You were sleeping?
886,886, Yes!
887,887,I was micro napping.
888,888, That's what you call that?
889,889, Yes.
890,890,"Sorry, I didn't realize you were sleeping."
891,891,You were standing and your eyes were open.
892,892, Do you need something?
893,893, I have some jokes that I wrote that I was gonna run by you if you have a second.
894,894,"Yeah, that was actually a really good nap."
895,895,Great. Seemed very restful.
896,896,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Okay."
897,897,Whoa.
898,898,I feel like these jokes are a little angry.
899,899,"Oh. I thought maybe they were, like, emphatic?"
900,900,"""With every fracking drill thrust, we are literally buttfucking Mother Earth""?"
901,901,It can be normal fucking.
902,902,It doesn't have to be in the butt.
903,903,I can take that part out.
904,904,"Yeah, listen, Fred."
905,905,"If I'm angry, I'm hysterical."
906,906,"If I'm emotional, I'm weak."
907,907,"If I so much as raise my voice, I'm a bitch."
908,908,My job's hard.
909,909,Not as hard as mine.
910,910,"I think maybe, like, part of the problem is that, like, a lot of humor is based on, like, personal experiences."
911,911,"I was thinking, you know, you cared a lot about the environment  since high school."
912,912, Mmmhmm.
913,913,So maybe include some stories about that.
914,914, High school?
915,915, Yeah.
916,916, You think that's funny?
917,917, I think it's a good area.
918,918,"Nostalgia, pop culture references."
919,919,People love that.
920,920,Jimmy Fallon's made an entire career off of that.
921,921,"When I think about school, I just think about studying."
922,922,"No, you did so much more than that."
923,923,I think your whole 1991 platform was pretty onpoint when you were running for Student Council.
924,924,"I remember you said, ""Everyone at this school pretends to care about the underdog, but the planet Earth is the biggest underdog of them all.""  Something like that."
925,925, I said that?
926,926,"Yeah, you did say that."
927,927,"You were in the kitchen, making pizza."
928,928,We were making signs for your election.
929,929,And you were wearing that shirt.
930,930,"I don't know if it was a strawberry or a flower, it always confused me."
931,931,It was both.
932,932,"Oh, there you go."
933,933,"That's all I remember about that night, though."
934,934,"Uh, that's where my memories concerning that evening expire."
935,935,I learned a lot from that election.
936,936,"Yeah, that kids are probably more likely to vote for two proms than a very elaborate recycling program."
937,937," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font>  Not only kids."
938,938,"Yeah, that's true."
939,939,Did you know he asked me out to one of those proms?
940,940, Bill Sterling?
941,941, Yeah.
942,942,After he beat you?
943,943, Yup.
944,944, Prom one or prom two?
945,945,Oh!
946,946,What a fuckhead!
947,947,You're way better than prom two.
948,948,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS AND LAUGHS)</font> I went to zero proms, by the way, for the record."
949,949,I think you're the smart one in this situation.
950,950,"Yes, that's why I didn't go to prom."
951,951,'Cause I was too smart. Uh...
952,952,Cool. I'll get to work on that speech stuff.
953,953,Great.
954,954,"Hey, Fred."
955,955,Yeah.
956,956,"You know, if you want to try some nonjoke stuff, just go ahead."
957,957,Really?
958,958,Like the main part of the speech?
959,959,Yeah. Just write.
960,960,Cool. Awesome. Thanks.
961,961,"If you take another nap, you should put on, like, a bicycle helmet or something."
962,962,"'Cause you're gonna tip over, there's turbulence."
963,963, That's actually a really good idea.
964,964, It is. I want you to be careful.
965,965, Yeah.
966,966, We need you.
967,967,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(BAND PLAYING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(CROWD APPLAUDING)</font>  Ambassador."
968,968, Welcome to Sweden.
969,969,Nice to see you again.
970,970,"Yeah, you too."
971,971,I look forward to seeing you tonight at dinner.
972,972,Yes.
973,973,"Uh, Madam Secretary, I have some ideas I wanna throw by you."
974,974,"Yeah, soon, Fred."
975,975,"Tom, do you have the schedule?"
976,976," <font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: Yes, of course, ma'am."
977,977," <font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> All right."
978,978,"<font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: In the back, Flarsky!"
979,979,"<font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: Then at 8:15, you have a fitting for tonight's gala."
980,980,"Then at 8:45, a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Masum, to Brazilian President Temer about deforestation issues."
981,981,UK Foreign Secretary Green to discuss your tour of Scotland in a few weeks.
982,982,a call with New York Times to comment on POTUS' latest Instagram attack on Prime Minister Bharath of Kashtar.
983,983,"At 5:45, we're meeting with the head of Sweden's Diplomatic Protocol, Ingrid Minervudottir, to discuss tonight's schedule."
984,984,Okay. And then after that?
985,985,"Also, Parker Wembley keeps trying to get  some face time with you."
986,986," Oh, God."
987,987,"Parker can wait. Okay, Fred. Go."
988,988,"Yeah, sure. Um..."
989,989,"So, uh, you know, based on what we were talking about last night, I just took a stab at the whole speech, basically."
990,990,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CLICKS TONGUE)</font> That's good."
991,991, Thank you.
992,992, This part isn't.
993,993,"Okay, well, you said you didn't want to sound too angry."
994,994,I also don't want to sound like I have a head injury.
995,995,"Okay. Uh, I'll go change it."
996,996,Great. Thanks.
997,997,"Okay, here we go."
998,998," <font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font>  So... All right."
999,999,Fred.
1000,1000,Yeah?
1001,1001,Do you have any grownup clothes to wear tonight?
1002,1002,"I was gonna... I was thinking of zipping this up all the way, like to here."
1003,1003,"That's kind of a little more... It's, like, slightly more buttoned up."
1004,1004,"You know what, Madam Secretary, I would be delighted to dress Fred for tonight."
1005,1005,"Thank you, Maggie. I'd be thrilled to have you dress me for tonight's event."
1006,1006,What a fun adventure.
1007,1007,Get a little makeover.
1008,1008,"All right, have a good one."
1009,1009,"Thank you, Fred."
1010,1010,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Why, thank you."
1011,1011,"<font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: ...and then it's saying hello, you'll sit down, we'll have dinner,  I'll pull you up..."
1012,1012, Where's Flarsky?
1013,1013,Why are we waiting?
1014,1014,"What, is he doing his hair?"
1015,1015,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Um..."
1016,1016,Oh.
1017,1017," <font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: What the..."
1018,1018," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE LAUGHING)</font> What the fuck are you wearing?"
1019,1019,She bought me this shit. Okay?
1020,1020,It's a traditional Swedish suit.
1021,1021,I don't see another fucking Swede up in here dressed like this.
1022,1022,It's all I could do on such short notice.
1023,1023,"You just take the jacket off, it's going to make it better."
1024,1024,It's just... Make it look...
1025,1025,"Oh, my God."
1026,1026,Better with the jacket on? Great.
1027,1027,"Razzing the new guy, I get it."
1028,1028,"Fuck you, Maggie."
1029,1029,Calm the Smurf down.
1030,1030,Bring a fucking suit next time.
1031,1031,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CLEARS THROAT)</font> Did you like the speech?"
1032,1032,"Yes, the speech is good."
1033,1033,"Oh, you're going to have to stay way back there, Fred."
1034,1034,"Just stay back, Flarsky."
1035,1035,Okay? She's got to focus.
1036,1036,On what?
1037,1037,Getting India and China to agree to be a part of this initiative.
1038,1038,They haven't even agreed to be a part of it yet?
1039,1039,They will. We just have to sort out a few details.
1040,1040,We just wrote a whole speech about how they're onboard already.
1041,1041,"Don't worry, Fred."
1042,1042,"You just stay here and make sure nobody from Candy Land needs their car parked, okay?"
1043,1043,I don't know why you needed a writer. Those are sick burns.
1044,1044,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)</font> <font color""ff8000"">CRIER</font>: Secretary of State Charlotte Field of the United States of America."
1045,1045,Your Majesty. Your Highness.
1046,1046, Your Highness.
1047,1047, Pleasure.
1048,1048," <font color""ff00ff"">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>  Oh."
1049,1049,"No, thank you."
1050,1050,I'm working right now.
1051,1051,"And you know you are, too."
1052,1052,I do know that.
1053,1053,"But you dressed me like Cap'n Crunch's Grindr date, so I'm going to drink to make you uncomfortable."
1054,1054,"Honestly, Fred, your entire life makes me uncomfortable."
1055,1055,"<font color""ff00ff"">(MAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)</font> <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Oh no, fuck me."
1056,1056,"<font color""ff00ff"">(MAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)</font>  Yes."
1057,1057," <font color""ff00ff"">(CONTINUES IN SWEDISH)</font> We both shop in the same mystical village, I see."
1058,1058," <font color""ff00ff"">(CONTINUES IN SWEDISH)</font>  Yes, you look great."
1059,1059, Congratulations.
1060,1060, SkÃ¥l.
1061,1061,"SkÃ¥l. SkÃ¥l to you, too."
1062,1062," <font color""ff00ff"">(SPEAKS SWEDISH)</font>  Yes. <font color""ff00ff"">(SPEAKS SWEDISH)</font> Jesus."
1063,1063,"Hey, we're making a few revisions to the speech."
1064,1064, What?
1065,1065," So we're losing the ""Seas"" part, so go cut that, and then brainstorm a couple of other funny lines for the ""Trees"" section, okay?"
1066,1066,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
1067,1067,"Losing the ""Seas"" part, why?"
1068,1068,Because India wouldn't go for it.
1069,1069,So we had to pivot.
1070,1070,"That's not a pivot, that's a third of the whole fucking shit."
1071,1071,Are you kidding me?
1072,1072,"That's it, it's just gone?"
1073,1073," Yeah, it's gone."
1074,1074, And there's nothing we can do?
1075,1075,No. And you don't have to worry about it.
1076,1076,Just go over to the computer.
1077,1077,Start typeytyping.
1078,1078,"Well, no."
1079,1079,I'm not gonna do that.
1080,1080,"So you quit, resignation accepted."
1081,1081,I will rewrite the speech.

1178,1178,Good. Great.
1179,1179,"Also, I googled speech writing and it was actually very informative."
1180,1180,"What I learned was that in order to write better for you, I should kinda get to know you better and get in your head, and everything I already know about you, I kinda used on the first speech."
1181,1181,"So, what I did was I wrote a ton of questions that will maybe help me capture your voice, if you have a minute."
1182,1182,I actually have seven.

1196,1196,"Oh, I'm fully aware of what happened in every season of Game of Thrones."

1411,1411,"I can think of worse ways to go than here with you. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Honestly, this has been like, the best few weeks of my entire life."
1412,1412,You don't have to say it back to me.
1413,1413,I know it's not true for you.
1414,1414,"I saw you sing with Bruce Springsteen last year, at that benefit concert."
1415,1415,That was probably a way better week.
1416,1416,"Just as an example. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Well, this is a pretty close second."
1417,1417,Really? To The Boss?
1418,1418, Yeah.
1419,1419, Wow. That's nice.
1420,1420,Uh...
1421,1421,"I feel like maybe you want me to kiss you right now, but I don't want to make the same stupid mistake I made 25 years ago."
1422,1422,Wouldn't be a stupid mistake.
1423,1423,Wait... Really?
1424,1424,We've secured the location.
1425,1425,But we need to move you.
1426,1426,The helicopter is standing by.
1427,1427,"Thank you, Agent M."

1451,1451, Okay. Yeah.
1452,1452,"Should I go in, then?"
1453,1453,"Yeah, enter."
1454,1454,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no!"
1455,1455, I'm gonna come really soon.
1456,1456, Me too.
1457,1457, Really?

1467,1467,"Wow. Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
1468,1468,I don't know what happened.
1469,1469,I usually last way longer than that.
1470,1470, You know?
1471,1471, Not me.
1472,1472, That was weird.
1473,1473," We both said, ""Oh, boy"" when we came..."
1474,1474," Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
1475,1475, ...at the same time.
1476,1476, That's never happened before.
1477,1477, I've never said that.
1478,1478, Yeah.
1479,1479, Super strange.
1480,1480, Oh!
1481,1481, Should we do that again?
1482,1482,"Yeah, my hands are shaking, I need a minute."
1483,1483,"<font color""ff00ff"">(EXHALES)</font> Hmm."
1484,1484, Who's this little guy?
1485,1485," <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHING)</font> I was a writing an article about NeoNazis and I had to get a bottom half of a swastika tattooed on me..."
1486,1486," Oh, my God."
1487,1487," ...so they wouldn't kill me and I didn't want that, so I added little shoes and I made him a little stick man and I named him Adolf Stickler."
1488,1488,You'd never know he had little swastika legs.
1489,1489, No.
1490,1490, He's so happy about it.
1491,1491,"I know, they just look like pants."
1492,1492,You'd never know he was born in the fires of hatred.
1493,1493,"<font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHING)</font> Man, I am hungry."
1494,1494,What time is it?
1495,1495,I couldn't tell you what fucking day it is.
1496,1496,And where... Where are we right now?
1497,1497,I don't have a clue.
1498,1498,You don't know?
1499,1499,No. They just dropped us here.
1500,1500,They just took us here on the helicopter.
1501,1501," <font color""ff8000"">AGENT M</font>: Good morning, Mr. Flarsky."
1502,1502, Jesus!

1505,1505,They wouldn't believe me anyway.
1506,1506,Fair enough.

1515,1515,"Like, I'm beginning to realize, I may have never been happy."
1516,1516,This might be the first time I ever felt happy.
1517,1517,And it feels good.
1518,1518,"This is, like, the best shit that's ever happened."
1519,1519,"There's like this crazy big banquet thing tonight, and she gave me like a tuxedo to wear."
1520,1520,"And it's not like a date, but it kinda feels like a date."
1521,1521,How do I not fuck this up?
1522,1522,Seems impossible.
1523,1523,"Dude, you just need to give yourself affirmation, man."

1527,1527,"Okay, look, I gotta go."
1528,1528,I have no fucking clue how to tie a bow tie.

1534,1534,Thank you.
1535,1535,Thanks for the suit.
1536,1536,We should probably head in.
1537,1537, Shall we?
1538,1538," <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Yeah."
1539,1539,Wow. This is awesome.
1540,1540,It's cool being in Argentina.
1541,1541,I think the guys who killed my grandparents are hiding here somewhere.
1542,1542,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Shit, they got a band."
1543,1543,"Do you wanna, uh, dance maybe?"
1544,1544,Or grab a drink?
1545,1545,So there are representatives from over 75 countries here tonight.
1546,1546,"She has three hours to get out there,  shake her money maker..."
1547,1547, Yeah.
1548,1548,...and get as many commitments as possible.
1549,1549, This is a work event.
1550,1550," Of course, yeah. I get it."
1551,1551,"We could, uh, maybe at the end of the night, have a drink."
1552,1552,"Yeah, if you have time."
1553,1553,Cool.
1554,1554, We'll see.
1555,1555, Yeah.
1556,1556,All right. Okay.
1557,1557,I know what's going on.
1558,1558, What do you mean?
1559,1559, You know what I mean.
1560,1560, There's nothing going on.
1561,1561," Don't fucking bullshit me, Fred."
1562,1562,'Cause my EQ is through the goddamn roof.
1563,1563,And I understand and intuit the nuances of social dynamics like you wouldn't believe.
1564,1564,The two of you are having sex with each other.
1565,1565,There's no way you could discern something like that.
1566,1566,Charlotte told me.
1567,1567, Really?
1568,1568," No, but you just did, you fucking idiot."
1569,1569,Fuck! Shit!
1570,1570,That was fucking very clever.
1571,1571,"Jesus, well, you know what, yes."
1572,1572,Okay. We're sexing one another down.
1573,1573, So?
1574,1574, Ew.
1575,1575,"Honestly, it's probably weirder to me than it is to you."
1576,1576,"Look, I can't believe I have to say this, but just so you know, there's no way the two of you work."
1577,1577,Why would you say that?
1578,1578,You don't know that.
1579,1579,"The public will never accept the two of you together, so neither will she."
1580,1580,"Honestly, Fred, it doesn't matter if you get it or you don't, 'cause the truth is, she is going to realize it for the both of you, then you'll have your heart broken."
1581,1581,And that could be kinda fun to watch.

1704,1704,Why would he do that?
1705,1705,Because he's funded by a bunch of fucking rich assholes and I probably pissed one of them off.

2065,2065," Well, I don't think you should right now."
2066,2066," Oh, my God!"
2067,2067,Of course you don't think I should.
2068,2068,"You never compromise for anything in your life, which gives you the perfect excuse to fail."
2069,2069,"Well, it's better than maybe bending over backwards for anyone who asks, to the point that you don't even know why you're doing this shit anymore!"
2070,2070,"In my world, in order to achieve what I'm trying to achieve,  I have to compromise."
2071,2071," Oh, why? 'Cause you're a woman?"
2072,2072," Yeah, motherfucker."
2073,2073," Okay, that makes sense."
2074,2074,And because I'm not giving up everything I've ever wanted just because it doesn't live up to your moral code.
2075,2075,I don't care if this tape comes out.
2076,2076,I really don't.
2077,2077," Oh, my God, Fred."
2078,2078, I'll be okay.
2079,2079,You don't have to do this for me.
2080,2080,You're not doing this for me.
2081,2081,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SCOFFS)</font> Obviously."
2082,2082,Look... you and I both know the woman who stands beside the guy who's coming on his face gets way more scrutiny than the guy who's actually coming on his face.
2083,2083,"Don't know if that's happened enough for there to be a precedent for it, but..."
2084,2084,"So, who knows? Maybe that won't be the case this time. Who knows?"
2085,2085,Maybe people will think it's romantic. I'm jerking off to you.
2086,2086,You don't know how people are gonna react.
2087,2087,I'm not taking that risk.
2088,2088,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> I can't do it."
2089,2089,Okay.
2090,2090,So the video doesn't come out.
2091,2091,What happens to us?
2092,2092,"I was talking to Maggie, and..."
2093,2093,she knows this consultant who could scrub your history.
2094,2094,We could make sure nothing else like this pops up and surprises us.
2095,2095,And then we just...
2096,2096,"we work on your image, and we figure out how we want to present ourselves as a couple to the public."
2097,2097,That's all.
2098,2098, Okay.
2099,2099, Okay.
2100,2100,"How long will it take, do you think, to... to create an image of me that we can present to the public?"
2101,2101,Just through the first couple of months of... of the campaign.
2102,2102,You think?
2103,2103,"But you don't know that, right?"
2104,2104,It could take longer than that.
2105,2105,"In a couple of months, you could find that it's not a good moment to introduce a new boyfriend, right?"
2106,2106,And then we'd have to wait a couple more months.
2107,2107,"I don't know how long it's gonna take, Fred."
2108,2108,"And then meanwhile, you're pretending not to date me."
2109,2109,"And you're scrubbing my Internet history, so all my articles are gone."
2110,2110,"And you, like, sneak me around like I'm Marilyn Monroe and you're JFK?"
2111,2111,Is that what we're talking about?
2112,2112,I just want to be clear that's what we're talking about.
2113,2113,And we have to do that because I'm...
2114,2114,not right.
2115,2115,"And then once we present us to the world, we present a version of me that isn't..."
2116,2116,actually me?
2117,2117,Yeah.
2118,2118,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> I can't do it."
2119,2119,"I wish... that I was the type of person that could, but I can't."

2122,2122,Don't know why the fuck I thought someone like her and someone like me could work.

2124,2124,"Like, I don't even know her."
2125,2125,"Like, I don't know who she is."
2126,2126,She has no moral compass.
2127,2127,"She's working with Democrats one day, Republicans the next fucking day."
2128,2128,What's wrong with working with Democrats and Republicans?
2129,2129,That's the whole country.
2130,2130,"Uh, yeah, except fuck Republicans, I guess is the problem with that."
2131,2131,"Speaking as an American, shouldn't you see both sides?"
2132,2132,Yeah.
2133,2133,I see one side's fucking wrong.

2138,2138,"Yeah, you know me."
2139,2139,You're a Republican?
2140,2140,"Yeah, I'm a Republican! This shit has worked out so far for me."
2141,2141,"What the fuck, man? All that shit you're always saying to me!"
2142,2142,Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And being in charge of your own destiny.
2143,2143, Republican shit.
2144,2144, And it worked on me!
2145,2145,And it works on a lot of people.
2146,2146," Oh, that's fucking sick!"
2147,2147, That's right.
2148,2148,Ugh! That's gross!
2149,2149,"That Republican shit, you put it in my brain and it made me feel good..."
2150,2150,"that's fucked up, man!"
2151,2151,"Come on. This is what I'm talking about, your negative way of thinking."
2152,2152, I don't even know you!
2153,2153, What do you mean?
2154,2154,I'm the same dude from two minutes ago. Your best friend.
2155,2155,Why did you never tell me this?
2156,2156,'Cause I knew you'd act exactly how you're acting right now.
2157,2157,Wait a minute.
2158,2158,"You're always talking about how, like, the universe has a plan for all of us."
2159,2159,Take it easy.
2160,2160,There's someone watching over us at all times.
2161,2161, Yeah.
2162,2162, Does that mean...
2163,2163,I'm a man of Christian faith.
2164,2164,What the fuck!
2165,2165, Come on now! We pray for you!
2166,2166, Don't pray for me! Keep it!
2167,2167, Lord...
2168,2168," Oh, stop it. Ignore him, God!"
2169,2169, He doesn't mean that.
2170,2170, Don't pray for me!
2171,2171, You are trippin' right now.
2172,2172, I'm not! How could you be Christian?
2173,2173,I wear this cross every day since you've known me!
2174,2174, What did you think it was for?
2175,2175, I thought it was a...
2176,2176,cultural thing.
2177,2177,"You mean, like, 'cause I'm black?"
2178,2178,"That's what I thought, yeah."
2179,2179,That might be. But that don't mean what you said ain't racist.
2180,2180, You're right.
2181,2181," Yeah, I know I'm right!"
2182,2182, Fuck.
2183,2183, That's racist as shit!
2184,2184,"All right, dude, I love you, man."
2185,2185,But you're very judgmental.
2186,2186,"They don't want politics to get into this, because you've never really been good at looking at shit from other people's perspective, Fred."
2187,2187,I know.
2188,2188,It might explain why you haven't been able to look at this through Charlotte's eyes.
2189,2189,I'm sorry you couldn't be who you are around me and had to hide your true self.
2190,2190, That's really fucked up.
2191,2191," It's all right, man."
2192,2192,But my love for the GOP and the GOD has nothing to do with us.
2193,2193,I'm racist. You're a Republican. I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2197,2197,"Well, polls say that people find my laugh unattractive."
2198,2198,So I shouldn't laugh in public.
2199,2199,"That was a bit of a bummer, 'cause I really... I like to laugh."
2200,2200, A lot.
2201,2201, Hmm.

2212,2212,It's called Mini Bar.
2213,2213,It's quite exclusive.
2214,2214,You need a little key to access it.
2215,2215,And you get charged as you remove the bottle.
2216,2216,Mmm.
2217,2217,"It's actually more of a small fridge than a bar, and it's in my room..."
2218,2218," No, I get it."

2393,2393,"<font color""ff00ff"">(BREATHING SHAKILY, CHUCKLES)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(DOORBELL BUZZING)</font> Oh."
2394,2394,Hello?
2395,2395,"Hey, Fred, uh, there's a million people out here and they want to talk to the candidate and the come guy."
2396,2396,"So, I figured they'd hit you."
2397,2397,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ALL CHEERING)</font> <font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: Fred!"
2398,2398,Fred!
2399,2399,A crazy day.
2400,2400,But I'm really glad you're all here.
2401,2401,I'd like to introduce you to someone.
2402,2402,This is Fred.
2403,2403,Hi there.
2404,2404, My boyfriend.
2405,2405," <font color""ff00ff"">(ALL CHEERING)</font> Whoo!"
2406,2406,"You kind of know him already, but you'll get to know him a lot more in the next few months..."
2407,2407,'cause he's gonna be right by my side on my campaign trail.
2408,2408,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ALL CHEERING, APPLAUDING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(CHEERING LOUDER)</font> Wakanda forever!"
2409,2409,Charlotte! Charlotte!
2410,2410,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ALL CHANTING)</font> Charlotte! Charlotte!"
2411,2411,Charlotte! Charlotte!
2412,2412,"<font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: I started this chant!"
2413,2413,I started that chant!
2414,2414,...that I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States.
2415,2415,"<font color""ff8000"">FEMALE REPORTER</font>: What a momentous day. Our first female president."
2416,2416,I never thought I'd see it.
2417,2417,"Well, I mean, a lot of people are gonna say this is a historic moment for women everywhere."
2418,2418,But do we want her finger on the button when it's that time of the month?
2419,2419,I wouldn't want my wife making any decision during that time of the month.
2420,2420,You know what?
2421,2421,Fuck you guys. I quit.
2422,2422,"Looks like it's someone's time of the month. <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS)</font> Looks like Aunt Flow is going to work down at the Red River Casino... Oh!"
2423,2423,"Jesus Christ! Quick, quick, cut!"
2424,2424,Hi! I'm the First Mister of the United States of America.
2425,2425,My name is Fred Field.
2426,2426,I took my wife's last name.
2427,2427,"And, uh, I'm gonna give you a tour of the White House."
2428,2428,We're starting with the portraits of the first spouses.
2429,2429,Here we have Mamie Eisenhower.
2430,2430,Jackie Kennedy.
2431,2431,We have the beautiful Lady Bird Johnson's portrait.
2432,2432,And that leads us into my portrait.
2433,2433,"It was painted by Todd McFarlane, who created the Spawn comics, of course."
2434,2434,The first versions were a little over the top.
2435,2435,"Hi, guys."
2436,2436,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: I used to think the best way for me to change the world, to make it a better place was through journalism."
2437,2437,And I've realized that's not at all the case.
2438,2438,"Really, the best thing I could be doing for the world is just supporting this amazing person and just trying to learn from her and kinda just trying to be the best First Mister I can be."
2439,2439,I actually got a tattoo of the First Mister insignia.
2440,2440, He did.
2441,2441, There we are.
2442,2442, You're wearing mittens.
2443,2443, I got little mittens on.
2444,2444,"If you think of where this tattoo started to where it ended up, it really has an amazing arc to it."
2445,2445,"<font color""ff8000"">INTERVIEWER</font>: What are some of the perks of your new roles?"
2446,2446,"Well, I finally get to enact my vision for America."
2447,2447,I finally got to find out who killed Kennedy.
2448,2448," Oh, my God. Don't you dare."
2449,2449, I won't say.
2450,2450, Don't.
2451,2451, I won't say.
2452,2452," Fred, I'm not kidding around."
2453,2453, It's not who you think!
2454,2454, Don't do it.
2455,2455, It's pretty surprising.
2456,2456,He's my Mister.
2457,2457,I'm her Mister.
2458,2458,And she's my president.
