822,822,Just forget about it.
823,823,"You can't even hack an entrylevel job, and you want to raise a kid?"
824,824,Why don't you just come back to work?
825,825,People do work and take care of kids.
826,826,That's what grownups do.
827,827,Remember how you couldn't be bothered with this?
828,828,Yeah.
829,829,I want you to cut this for me.
830,830,"If you can do it, I'll sign your damn paper."

1044,1044,He said she needed it.
1045,1045,That this little girl needed a weapon to sleep with.
1046,1046,Hmm.
1047,1047,"Mr. Bennett, do you have something to say about this?"
1048,1048,Is that your version?
1049,1049,"Okay. Well, according to this report, there are issues of cleanliness, food hygiene seems to be problematic."
1050,1050,"Mr. Bennett, you took food from a garbage can to feed your sister?"
1051,1051,"Young man, it's time for you to speak up."
1052,1052,Now please tell this court why I should award you guardianship of your little sister.
1053,1053,Those papers don't say everything.
1054,1054,That's precisely why I'd like you to tell me what's not in these papers.
1055,1055,Is there any positive element that would help your case?
1056,1056,There's no positive element.
1057,1057,All I am is the only adult in the house who hasn't croaked.
1058,1058,"Don't give her to me, Judge."
1059,1059,I don't want the kid.
1060,1060,Judge Okay. It seems you're brighter than I thought.
1061,1061,You figured out that being a custodial parent was too much for you to handle.
1062,1062,Is that correct?
1063,1063,Huh? No.
1064,1064,She's easy to handle being with.
1065,1065,She's magic or whatever.
1066,1066,She'll be a woman before I'm a man.
1067,1067,"She'll be more beautiful than my mother, and she was a fox."
1068,1068,I don't wanna fuck you up.
1069,1069,"I mean, I didn't do too good with Richard, did I?"
1070,1070,They didn't want to run away from us.
1071,1071,They just died.
1072,1072,That's it.
1073,1073,It's not our fault.
1074,1074,"You know, maybe it's God's fault."
1075,1075,I'm not gonna croak.
1076,1076,God can't do anything about that.
1077,1077,"If you need me, I'll be there for you."
