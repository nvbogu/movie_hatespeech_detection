436,436,"Try feeding her, then fix up the mess you done made here."
437,437,I can smell the rain coming.
438,438,"Miss Celie, we got ourselves some new curtains I want to put in the bedroom."
439,439,The living room has already got itself some flowers.
440,440,What you looking at?
441,441,It's gonna rain on your head!
442,442,You ever hit her?
443,443,"No, sir."
444,444,How you expect her to mind?
445,445,"Heh, heh."
446,446,Wives is like children.
447,447,You have to let them know who got the upper hand.
448,448,Nothing can do it better than a good beating.
449,449,Sofia thinks too much of herself.
450,450,Needs to be taken down a peg or two.
451,451,Got a new baby and it cry all night long.
452,452,Kept him up so he said he wasn't going to work.
453,453,"She got all upset but I said, ""Leave the man alone."
454,454,"Sometimes a man just needs to be left alone."" I need something to eat!"
455,455,Pie's in the pantry. Women need to be left alone sometimes.
456,456,"I tell Harpo when I'm fussing, ""Leave me alone!""  Ain't you gonna get it for me?"
457,457, What's the matter with you?
458,458,That's my own baby crying. Lord.
459,459,"Make yourself useful, Harpo."
460,460,"Hush now, honey."
461,461,What am I gonna do about Sofia?
462,462,Beat her.
463,463,You told Harpo to beat me!
464,464,"It was that mule, Old Joey."
465,465,"Old Joey, the mule."
466,466,I was plowing the north field and the mule went crazy.
467,467,He started kicking.
468,468,Busted my eye and my lip.
469,469,All my life I had to fight.
470,470,"I had to fight my daddy, I had to fight my uncles."
471,471,I had to fight my brothers.
472,472,Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.
473,473,But I never thought I had to fight in my own house!
474,474,I loves Harpo.
475,475,God knows I do.
476,476,But I'll kill him dead before I let him beat me!
477,477, That's a hoof print.
478,478," No, that look like a fist print."
479,479,"No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face."
480,480,"No, sir."
481,481,"You want a dead soninlaw, Miss Celie?"
482,482,You keep on advising him like you doing.
483,483,This life be over soon.
484,484,Heaven lasts always.
485,485,You should bash Mister's head open and think about Heaven later.
486,486,Sofia beat on Harpo.
487,487,Then Harpo beat on Sofia.
488,488,And then Sofia beat on Harpo some more.
489,489,"In between the beatings, the children keep coming."
490,490,"And then one day, Sofia can't take it no more."
491,491,And good riddance!
492,492,"Bye, Clarence!"
493,493,"Bye, Emma! Bye, Ruby!"
494,494,"Bye, Sofia! Bye!"
495,495,Nettie.

504,504,And keep the plate!
505,505,Anything come for me?
506,506,"Dear God, today was a peculiar day."
507,507,I was sitting on the porch reading to the kids...
508,508,"...when all of a sudden, something struck me."
509,509,I got up and looked at the sky.
510,510,It was dark and there wasn't nothing moving.
511,511,I got down off the porch to see what was coming. It felt like twister weather.
512,512,I didn't see nothing.
513,513,But I know something's there.
514,514,"Yes, indeed, Lord."
515,515,I know something's coming.
516,516,"Pa! Who that, Pa? Who this?"
517,517,"Pa, who this?"
518,518,The woman that should have been your mammy.
519,519,Shug Avery?
520,520,Give me a hand and get her in the house.
521,521,Celie! Help me get her in the house.
522,522,Celie! Damn it! Get here!
523,523,Celie!
524,524,"Hey, Celie! Get here!"
525,525,"Celie, this Shug Avery, a friend of the family. Fix up the spare room."
526,526,I can't move.
527,527,I can't move. I need to see her eyes.
528,528,"I feel that once I see her eyes, my feet can let go..."
529,529,...of where they're stuck.

539,539,Get that thing to make me something to eat.

829,829,I's going to miss you too.
830,830,I'm going to miss you too.
831,831,"Come on! Let's go! Ha, ha!"
832,832,"Hey, Shug! Write!"
833,833,"Do good in Chicago, Shug!"
834,834,"Oh, shit."
835,835,"Honey, let me see you."
836,836,"Look at you, you're so sweet."
837,837,"Millie, let's leave them folks alone."
838,838,Look! Aren't they cute?
839,839," Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor."
840,840, Good to see you.
841,841,How are you today?
842,842,Look at that! That's the cutest little face I ever saw. Give me some sugar.
843,843,You are so sweet.
844,844,Say thank you now.
845,845,"Millie, always going on over the colored."
846,846,Your children are so clean.
847,847,Would you Iike to work for me?
848,848,Be my maid?
849,849,Hell no.
850,850,What did you say?
851,851,Hell no.
852,852,What did she say?
853,853,Can't you pump that a little faster?
854,854,"Gal, what did you say to Miss Millie?"
855,855,"I said, ""Hell"" No, Miss Sofia!"
856,856,"No, Miss Sofia! No!"
857,857,I can't believe you did that!
858,858,Get my children out of here!
859,859,Take them home!
860,860,Get my children out of here!
861,861,Who do you think you are?
862,862,Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
863,863,Don't touch me!
864,864,Who do you think you are?
865,865,You fat nigger!
866,866,"God, dear God! Sheriff, help me!"
867,867," Howdy, mayor."
868,868, Howdy.
869,869, How are you?
870,870," Fine, thank you."
871,871, How's the missus?
872,872, She's doing real well.
873,873,Let's see what we have here.
874,874,Ohh! I'm driving!
875,875,I'm driving.
876,876,Hey! Watch it!
877,877,"Look, I'm driving!"
878,878,Whoo! Isn't that fun?
879,879,"Dear God, after many years, they let Sofia out of jail..."
880,880,...just to put her in the next.
881,881,She ended up being Miss Millie's maid after all.
882,882,"Mayor bought Miss Millie a car, and she had Sofia teach her how to drive."
883,883,"Poor Sofia, stuck with Miss Millie for the rest of her life."
884,884, We went past the store.
885,885, Top the H.
886,886,I've got it. Top of the H.
887,887,Here we go.
888,888,"Oh, my. That was exciting, wasn't it?"
889,889,"Yes, ma'am, I reckon it was."
890,890,"Well, let's do the shopping!"
891,891,"Sofia, I need apples, raisins, cinnamon, currants, lemons..."
892,892,"...crackers, brown sugar, oranges, nutmeg, flour, salt, pepper..."
893,893,"...cloves, eggs, and some candy for the children."
894,894, How are you today?
895,895, Nice to see you!
896,896, Have a nice Christmas.
897,897, Same to you.
898,898,I've been wondering about starting a fund for the colored children.
899,899,It's a little late this year.
900,900,I meant to talk to some of the shopkeepers about it.
901,901,We could do one next year.
902,902,"Set up a fund so they could have some toys and some clothes, a toy or two."
903,903,I started taking driving lessons.
904,904,Did you see me out there?
905,905, Sofia's been teaching me how to drive.
906,906, That's wonderful.
907,907,Have you ever thought about going to Mars?
908,908,I wonder what it's like.
909,909,They call it the red planet.
910,910,Does it look red?
911,911, How are you doing today?
912,912, Good to see you. Hello.
913,913,"How do, Mr. Peters?"
914,914,"Look at me, I'm driving."
915,915,"Yes, ma'am."
916,916,"Sofia, I'm gonna drive you home tomorrow."
917,917,Did you hear what I said?
918,918,I'm gonna drive you home.
919,919, Home?
920,920," Yes, home."
921,921,You haven't seen your children in a while.
922,922,"No, I ain't seen them in about eight years."
923,923,That's a shame.
924,924,Tomorrow's Christmas!
925,925,You can stay all day!
926,926,You can stay all day!
927,927,I will drive myself back.
928,928,Thank you.
929,929,That's your mama.
930,930,That's her.
931,931,Go on.
932,932,"Hi, my name is Emma."
933,933,I'm very pleased to meet you.
934,934,Sofia back!
935,935," Sofia, I'll pick you up at 5:00."
936,936," Yes, ma'am."
937,937,Come on.
938,938,"Oh, Miss Sofia, it's so good to have you home."
939,939,"Oh, yes."
940,940,So good.
941,941,"Mama, why are you crying?"
942,942,Because I don't know y'all no more.
943,943,This is going to be a happy Christmas!
944,944,I can do it.
945,945,I can put it in reverse.
946,946,I can make it go the right way.
947,947,Come on. Ohh!
948,948,She can't get it out of reverse.
949,949,"Mrs. Millie! Whoa, whoa!"
950,950,Take off your coat.
951,951,Get away from me!
952,952,You get away from me!
953,953,Don't touch me!
954,954, Don't you know who I am?
955,955," Yes, ma'am."
956,956, I've always been good to you people!
957,957," We know that, ma'am."
958,958,Calm down.
959,959, I am Miss Millie! I'm the mayor's wife!
960,960," Yes, ma'am."
961,961,I've always been good to you people!
962,962,I've always gone out of my way for coloreds!
963,963,"Yes, ma'am."
964,964,"Miss Millie, what's the matter?"
965,965,Those boys....
966,966,Those boys tried to attack me.
967,967,No such a thing.
968,968,How could you leave me alone for so Iong?
969,969,Come on now. Come on.
970,970,What am I gonna do about the car?
971,971,"Jack will drive you home, Miss Millie."
972,972,I can't ride in a car with some strange colored man.
973,973,I'll ask my sister Odessa to squeeze in.
974,974,That way I have more time with my children.
975,975,I don't know her either.
976,976,Goodbye!
977,977,It's Shug.
978,978, Shug.
979,979, Heh. Hot diggidydog!
980,980,"I'm coming, Shug!"
981,981, It's sugarbaby!
982,982," Hey, Shug!"
983,983,"Hey, Shug!"
984,984,Albert!
985,985,"Hey, Shug Oh! Miss Celie!"

996,996,Brand new.
997,997,I want Albert to learn how to drive it.
998,998,Grady drive like a fool.
999,999,I thought the police would get us.
1000,1000,Us two married Iadies now.
1001,1001,"Two married ladies, and hungry!"
1002,1002,What us got to eat?
1003,1003,"Yeah, you know, Grady, we done had the best."
1004,1004, It's true.
1005,1005," Yeah, we done had the best."
1006,1006,You had her your way. I had her mine.
1007,1007,Hahahaha.
1008,1008,But we had her!
1009,1009,We had her!
1010,1010,Let's us drink to having some Shug.
1011,1011,I'll get my mail. I'm expecting an agreement from Memphis.
1012,1012,You ought to wait for Mister.
1013,1013,"If I was to wait for Albert, I'd wait till Christmas."
1014,1014,I's married now!
1015,1015,I said I's married now.
1016,1016,"Well, let's toast it at somebody."
1017,1017,"All the evil, and all the love."
1018,1018,"I like you, boy!"
1019,1019,I like you too!
1020,1020,Come upstairs with me.
1021,1021,I got to finish stuffing the turkey.
1022,1022,You're my kind of man!
1023,1023,"""April 1 8..."" ...1 935."
1024,1024,Dear Celie: I know you think I'm dead...
1025,1025,...but I am not.
1026,1026,I've been writing to you over the years...
1027,1027,...but Albert said you'd never hear from me again...
1028,1028,...and since I never heard from you all this time...
1029,1029,...I guess he was right.
1030,1030,Now I only write at Christmas and Easter...
1031,1031,...hoping my letters get lost among the Christmas and Easter greetings...
1032,1032,"""...or that Albert get the holiday spirit and have pity on us."" ""There is so much to tell you..."" ...I hardly know where to begin."
1033,1033,"And anyway, you probably won't get this letter either."
1034,1034,I am sure Albert is still the only one...
1035,1035,...to take the mail out of the box.
1036,1036,But if this does not get to him...
1037,1037,"...one thing I want you to know""...."
1038,1038,"""I Iove you..."" ...and I'm not dead."
1039,1039,I love you and I'm not dead.
1040,1040,"""The lady you met in town is named Corrine."" Her husband's named Samuel."
1041,1041,"Sanctified, religious and very good to me."
1042,1042,Their only sorrow in the beginning was...
1043,1043,...that they could not have children.
1044,1044,"And then they say""...."
1045,1045,"""Then they say..."" ...God sent them Olivia..."
1046,1046,...and Adam.
1047,1047,"Yes, their children sent by God are your children."
1048,1048,And they have been brought up in love.
1049,1049,And now God has sent me to watch over them...
1050,1050,...to protect and cherish them...
1051,1051,...to lavish all the love I feel for you on them.
1052,1052,"It's a miracle, isn't it?"
1053,1053,And no doubt impossible for you to believe.
1054,1054,Olivia and Adam are with me...
1055,1055,...all growing up together...
1056,1056,...a family.
1057,1057,"""Your loving sister, Nettie."" I got two children..."
1058,1058,...and they's alive.
1059,1059,"Hear that, Miss Shug?"
1060,1060,Olivia and Adam.
1061,1061,And they's alive.
1062,1062,"I love her as much as you, probably more."
1063,1063,I's getting real tired of this cat.
1064,1064,He coming back soon.
1065,1065,You crazy? He in the jook joint.
1066,1066,This doesn't look nothing Iike me.
1067,1067,Damn him.
1068,1068,"""Celie."" There's so many of them."
1069,1069,What us gonna do?
1070,1070,Go to my room and put them in order by the postmark.
1071,1071,"""Dear Celie, the reason why I am in Africa is because..."" ...one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel..."
1072,1072,...to help with the children and setting up the school...
1073,1073,"""...suddenly married a man, and I came in her place."" I wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship."
1074,1074,On my first sight of the Africa coast...
1075,1075,"...something struck in me, in my soul, Celie, like a large bell."
1076,1076,I just vibrated.
1077,1077,"It has been a long time since I had time to write, but always..."
1078,1078,"...no matter what I'm doing, I'm writing you. Dear Celie! Bring me a cool drink."
1079,1079,Olinka is four days march through the bush from the harbor.
1080,1080,Do you know what a jungle is?
1081,1081,Trees and trees and then more trees on top of that.
1082,1082,And big!
1083,1083,"They are so big, they look like they were built."
1084,1084,And vines and ferns and animals and noises...
1085,1085,...that make you wonder what is lurking behind the shadows...
1086,1086,...of every bush.
1087,1087,"We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of millet, porridge, fruit, then morning classes."
1088,1088,"We teach the children English, reading, writing..."
1089,1089,"...history, geography, arithmetic, and the stories of the Bible."
1090,1090,The older children are used to coming to the mission school.
1091,1091,The smaller ones are not.
1092,1092,Their mothers sometimes drag them here screaming and kicking.
1093,1093,They're all boys. Olivia's the only girl.
1094,1094,There is a little African girl called Tashi.
1095,1095,She plays with Olivia after school.
1096,1096,"""Why can't Tashi come to school?"" she asks me."
1097,1097,I told her the Olinka don't believe in educating girls.
1098,1098,"She said, quick as a flash: ""Like white people at home who don't want black people to learn."" She is sharp, Celie."
1099,1099,When Tashi can get away from her chores her mother assigns her...
1100,1100,...she and Olivia hide in my hut.
1101,1101,"To Olivia right now, Tashi alone is Africa."
1102,1102,"Everything she learns, she shares with Tashi. Sound familiar?"
1103,1103,"At first, there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest."
1104,1104,A kind of low humming. Then there was chopping and the sound of dragging.
1105,1105,Then the scent.
1106,1106,Some days there's smoke.
1107,1107,"Now, after two months during which I or the children..."
1108,1108,...or Corrine has been sick...
1109,1109,...all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging.
1110,1110,And every day we smell smoke.
1111,1111,"Today a boy in my afternoon class burst out as he entered: ""The road approaches!"" âª If you live right âª âª Heaven belongs to you âª âª If you live right âª âª Heaven belongs to you âª Dear Celie, the white man is building a road."
1112,1112,It finally reached the cassava fields nine months ago.
1113,1113,"The morning after the road was done, as far as Olinka was concerned..."
1114,1114,"...what should we discover, but that the road builders were back."
1115,1115,They have instructions to continue the road for another 30 miles...
1116,1116,...and continue it on its present course right through the village of Olinka.
1117,1117,The road builders didn't deviate an inch from the head man's plan.
1118,1118,Every hut that lay in the road's path was leveled.
1119,1119,"Celie, our church, our school..."
1120,1120,...my hut...
1121,1121,...all went down in a matter of hours.
1122,1122,But the worst is yet to be told.
1123,1123,Sweet Corrine died from fever and grief.
1124,1124,We buried her in the Olinka way.
1125,1125,"But, Celie, my dear, sweet sister..."
1126,1126,...we'll all be coming home once we work something out with U.S. lmmigration.
1127,1127,"They don't know if we're American, African, or missionary."
1128,1128,"Just pray for us, Celie."
1129,1129,Watch for me in the sunset.
1130,1130,What's with you?
1131,1131,I was calling you for an hour!
1132,1132,Now get my shave and don't keep me waiting!
1133,1133,"Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!"
1134,1134, Where's Celie?
1135,1135, Home fixing to shave Mister.
1136,1136,You got a fever? I didn't come here for you to take all day to shave me.
1137,1137,Get the molasses out of your ass!
1138,1138,"The longer I'm married to you, the slower and dumber you get."
1139,1139,Your ass is as slow as I ever seen it before.
1140,1140,Celie! Ain't that razor sharpened yet?
1141,1141,Get on out here and do me right now!
1142,1142,Get on out here!
1143,1143,All right.
1144,1144,No!
1145,1145,Put your head back.
1146,1146,Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears.
1147,1147,"That razor looks dull to me, Miss Celie."
1148,1148,Damn women.
1149,1149,"How you feeling, Miss Sofia?"
1150,1150,Confused.
1151,1151,Ain't you glad to be home?
1152,1152,Maybe.
1153,1153,"Grandpa, I'm full."
1154,1154,I'm not hungry anymore.
1155,1155, Now come the time for me to tell you.
1156,1156, What?
1157,1157,It's time for us to go.
1158,1158,You're such good people.
1159,1159,Salt of the earth.
1160,1160,It's time to move on.
1161,1161, Celie is coming with us.
1162,1162, Say what?
1163,1163,Celie is coming to Memphis with us.
1164,1164,Over my dead body!
1165,1165,You satisfied? That's what you want?
1166,1166,Now what's wrong with you?
1167,1167,"You a lowdown, dirty dog, that's what's wrong."
1168,1168,It's time for me to get away from you and enter Creation.
1169,1169,Your dead body be just the welcome mat I need.
1170,1170,You can't talk to my boy that way.
1171,1171,Your boy.
1172,1172,"If he hadn't been your boy, he might have been a halfway decent man."
1173,1173,Say what?
1174,1174,You took my sister Nettie away from me.
1175,1175,You knew she was the only somebody in the world who loved me.
1176,1176,But Nettie and my kids are coming home soon.
1177,1177,"And when we all get together, we're going to whup your ass."
1178,1178,Nettie and your kids?
1179,1179,"Woman, you talking crazy."
1180,1180,I got children.
1181,1181,My children are Iiving in Africa.
1182,1182,Africa!
1183,1183,Learning different languages.
1184,1184,"Fresh air, plenty of exercise."
1185,1185,They'll turn out better than these fools you never tried to raise.
1186,1186," Hold on, here!"
1187,1187," No ""hold on,"" Harpo."
1188,1188,"If you hadn't tried to rule over Sofia, white folks wouldn't have got her."
1189,1189, That's a lie!
1190,1190, A Iittle truth in it.
1191,1191,Y'all was rotten kids.
1192,1192,You was. You was rotten kids!
1193,1193,Made my life here hell.
1194,1194,Your daddy ain't nothing but some dead horseshit.
1195,1195,Shut up! It's bad luck for a woman to laugh at a man!
1196,1196,"My God, the dead has arisen."
1197,1197,I had enough bad luck to keep me laughing the rest of my life.
1198,1198,Sat in that jail till I near about done rot to death.
1199,1199,"I know what it like, Miss Celie."
1200,1200,Want to go somewhere and can't.
1201,1201,I know what it like to want to sing and have it beat out of you.
1202,1202,"I want to thank you, Miss Celie..."
1203,1203,...for everything you done for me.
1204,1204,I remember the day I was in the store with Miss Millie.
1205,1205,I was feeling real down.
1206,1206,I was feeling mighty bad.
1207,1207,And when I see'd you...
1208,1208,...I knowed there is a God.
1209,1209,"I knowed there is a God, and one day I was going to get to come home."
1210,1210,You won't get a penny of my money.

1233,1233,...and you acting like a waiter!
1234,1234,"Hush, you old fool!"
1235,1235,Always meddling in somebody's business.
1236,1236,Sofia home now. Just hush up!
1237,1237,She'll be back. Shug got talent.
1238,1238,She can sing.
1239,1239,She got spunk and can talk to anybody.
1240,1240,She can stand up and be noticed.
1241,1241,What you got?
1242,1242,You're ugly. You're skinny.
1243,1243,You're shaped funny.
1244,1244,You're too scared to open your mouth to people.
1245,1245, All you fit to do is be Shug's maid.
1246,1246," Albert, no."
1247,1247,"Take out her slop jar, maybe cook her food."
1248,1248,You ain't even that good a cook.
1249,1249,She's a lot better than that first wife you married.
1250,1250,This house ain't been cleaned good since my first wife died.
1251,1251,Nobody's crazy enough to marry you.
1252,1252,So what you gonna do?
1253,1253,Hire yourself to farm?
1254,1254,Maybe somebody will let you work on their railroad.
1255,1255,Maybe sweep out the caboose.
1256,1256,Any more letters come?
1257,1257,Could be. Could be not. Who's to say?
1258,1258,"Celie, no!"
1259,1259,I curse you! Until you do right by me...
1260,1260,...everything you think about will crumble!
1261,1261,Don't do it. Don't trade places with what I been through.
1262,1262,"Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go to the car."
1263,1263,He ain't worth it.
1264,1264,Who you think you is?
1265,1265,You can't curse nobody. Look at you!
1266,1266,"You're black, you're poor, you're ugly, you're a woman! You're nothing!"
1267,1267,"Until you do right by me, everything you even think about gonna fail!"
1268,1268,It's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
1269,1269,Goodbye.
1270,1270,Glad I came back just in time.
1271,1271,"We need some stability around here, that's for sure."
1272,1272,I should have locked you up!
1273,1273,Just let you out to work!
1274,1274,The jail you planned for me is the one you gonna rot in.
1275,1275,"Celie, get in the car. Get in the car."
1276,1276,Everything you done to me...
1277,1277,...is already done to you.
1278,1278,"I'm poor, black."
1279,1279,I may even be ugly.
1280,1280,"But dear God, I'm here!"
1281,1281,I'm here!

1293,1293,I hear you been spending more time at Harpo's and less in the fields.
1294,1294,I guess I just raised you wrong.
1295,1295,"How's that, Pa?"
