26,26,Then I'm your man.
27,27,"Is this it, Priest?"
28,28,The Pope's new army?
29,29,A few crusty bitches and a handful of ragtags!
30,30,"I know Bill. You swore, this was a battle between warriors."

43,43,"Us Natives, born rightwise to this fine land...."
44,44,...or the foreign hordes defiling it!
45,45,Under the ancient laws of combat I accept the challenge of the so called Natives.
46,46,You plague our people at every turn!
47,47,"But from this day out, you shall plague us no more!"
48,48,"Let it be known, that the hand that tries to strike us from this land..."
49,49,...shall be swiflty cut down!

70,70,"It's fair. A touch indelicate, but fair."
71,71,My sympathies.
72,72,What shall we do with the boy?

79,79,"Come here, boy. You're going to Hell's Gate!"
80,80,There he is!

82,82,Priest Vallon died a noble death.
83,83,But his Dead Rabbits is done and outlawed.
84,84,Let no one even speak their name from now on.
85,85,"In this place, you've grown from a boy into a man."
86,86,Put to death the earthly things in you.
87,87,Immorality. Impurity.
88,88,Passion. Vengeance.
89,89,The Lord has forgiven you.
90,90,You also must forgive.
91,91,You go forth to a country torn apart by civil strife.
92,92,"Thank you, Reverend."
93,93,Lend your hand to the work that yet remains.
94,94,That this war may end.
95,95,"And the plague of slavery, that brought this confergration down upon us  ..."
96,96,...vanish forever from the earth.
97,97,In the second year of the great civil war...
98,98,...when the irish brigades marched through the streets...
99,99,...New york was a city full of tribes.
100,100,War chiefs. Rich and poor.
101,101,Lincoln will make all white men slaves!
102,102,It wasn't a city really.
103,103,It was more a furnace.
104,104,Where cities someday might be forged.
105,105,That's the spirit boys.
106,106,Go off and die for your blackie friends.
107,107,We should have run a better man against Lincoln when we had the chance.
108,108,"They are trying to say ,we are no different than niggers."
109,109,You ain't.
110,110,"Go back to Africa, niggers!"
111,111,The angriest talk was of the new conscription act.
112,112,The first draft in Union history.
113,113,Join the army lads. Three square meals a day and good pay.
114,114,"When the Irish came, the city was in a fever."
115,115,Since the time of the great famine they'd come streaming off the boats.
116,116,And they got a right warm welcome.
117,117,"Go back to Ireland, you dumb Mick!"
118,118,You'll remember that!
119,119,"Get back on the boat, Paddy!"
120,120,I came only 2 hours down river from Hell Gate...
121,121,..but they all took me for an immigrant.
122,122,Why not?
123,123,There were a 1000 different accents in New York..
124,124,"..and to the Natives you see, they were all the same."
125,125,Come here to take the chill off your soul and the weight off your heart.
126,126,"Welcome to America son, your long arduous journey is over."
127,127,Go back to your own country.
128,128,Vote Tammany!
129,129,America for Americans!
130,130,New York loved William Tweed and hated him.
131,131,And those of us trying to be thieves....
132,132,...we couldn't help but admire him.
133,133,Mr. Cutting. Gentlemen.
134,134,Thank you for coming.
135,135,It's an honour.
136,136,Mr. Tweed?
137,137,Sir! Please! Excuse me?
138,138,I think your're frightening them.
139,139,So?
140,140,"Don't mind him, he used to be an Irishman."
141,141,The Five Points!
142,142,Murderer's Alley. Brickbat Mansion.
143,143,The Gates of hell!
144,144,In this wild place....
145,145,Look upon the face of this poor child.
146,146,"She lives in squalor, in this godforsaken den of vice and misery behind me."
147,147,Every year the Reformers came.
148,148,Every year the Points got worse.
149,149,As if it liked being dirty.
150,150,Where am I going to go?
151,151,Move.
152,152,The Reverend wants you out of here.
153,153,"You may or not know Bill, that every day I go down to the waterfront..."
154,154,...with hot soup for the Irish as they come on shore.
155,155,As part of building a political base.
156,156,I've noticed you there.
157,157,You may have noticed me?
158,158,Indeed I have!
159,159,Throwing torrents of favours and withering abuse on every person who step off those boats.
160,160,If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed...
161,161,"...I'd shoot each and everyone of them, before they set foot on American soil."
162,162,Mulbeery street and Worth. Cross.
163,163,Orange and Littlewater.
164,164,Each of the Five Points is a finger...
165,165,...when I close my hand it becomes a fist.
166,166,"And any time that I wish, I can turn it against you."
167,167,I understand. But we're talking about different things.
168,168,I'm talking about civic duty.
169,169,Responsibilites we owe to the people.
170,170,Schools and hospitals. Sewers and utilities.
171,171,"Street construction, repairs and sweeping. Business and saloon licences..."
172,172,St. Michael the Archangel...
173,173,Defend us in battle.
174,174,Be our protector against the snares and the wickedness of the devil.
175,175,"Streetcars, ferries, rubbish disposal."
176,176,"There's a power of money to be made in this city, Bill."
177,177,"With your help, the people must be made to understand..."
178,178,"...that all these things are best kept, in what I like to call the Tammany family."
179,179,That is why I am talking about an alliance between our organisations.
180,180,You're talking about muscle work.
181,181,That too. Muscle to match our spirit.
182,182,"You own the crushers, get them to do it."
183,183,"The police? Oh, no! Jezus,no!"
184,184,The appearance of the law must be upheld.
185,185,Especially while it's been broken.
186,186,"Give me the strength, for what I must do."
187,187,Who are you?
188,188,"I said, who are you?"
189,189,What are you doing here?
190,190,I just like it down here is all.
191,191,"See what's in his pockets, Jimmy."
192,192,"Now look, boys. I really don't want to fight."
193,193,You don't want to fight?
194,194,"Don't worry, son. Ain't gonna be much of a fight."
195,195,Don't kill me.
196,196,Where did you get that?
197,197,I told you I didn't want to fight!
198,198,Why not?
199,199,Look how good you done.
200,200,You're the priest's son aren't you?
201,201,You! Get away from me.
202,202,You understand?
203,203,"You don't remember me, do you?"
204,204,I was the one tried to help you.
205,205,What?
206,206,I was the one tried to help you.
207,207,When the Natives took you.
208,208,That was you?
209,209,Yeah. I thought you was killed.
210,210,They just locked me up You know that.
211,211,This long?
212,212,"I kept trying to escape, you know."
213,213,Did more time for that.
214,214,So what are you doing back here?
215,215,Guess I missed the place.
216,216,Bowery boys.
217,217,The Five Points.
218,218,Paradise square!
219,219,The streets here are always livelier in the evening.
220,220,Who are the gangs around now?
221,221,We got the Daybreak boys and the Swamp Angels.
222,222,They work the River Luton ships.
223,223,The Frog Haulers shanghai sailors down around the bay.
224,224,"Shortails were rough for awhile, but they became a bunch of jackrolling dandies."
225,225,Lolling around Murderer's Alley looking like Chinamen.
226,226,Hellcat Maggie she tried to open up her own grog shop.
227,227,But she drunk up all her own liquor and got thrown out on the street.
228,228,Now she's on the lay for everything.
229,229,The Plug Uglies they're from somewhere in the old country.
230,230,They got their own language.
231,231,No one understands what they're saying.
232,232,They love to fight the cops.
233,233,And the Nightwalkers and Ratpickers.
234,234,They work on their backs and kill with their hands.
235,235,"They're so scurvy, only the Plug Uglies..."
236,236,...will talk with them.
237,237,But who knows what they're saying.
238,238,The Slaughterhouses and the Broadway Twisters are a fine bunch of Bengal boys!
239,239,And the little  Forty Thieves.
240,240,I used to run with them for a while.
241,241,Till they got taken over by Benjer the Cockroach and his red eyed buggers.
242,242,Benjer is a germ.
243,243,"If you try to leave the gang, they say..."
244,244,...he hacks the blood off you.
245,245,The righteousness are nothing but a bunch of repetitious grab ups..
246,246,The True Blue Americans call themselves a gang...
247,247,...but all they really do is stand around on corners damning Engeland.
248,248,Do you believe one word that the British say...?
249,249,Anything about the sand of the Dead Rabbits?
250,250,You don't say that name!
251,251,That name died with your...
252,252,It's been outlawed.
253,253,"When I was in the blockhouse, the chinks told me..."
254,254,...that the Natives celebrate their victory...
255,255,....every year.
256,256,Is that true?
257,257,"Aye, that they do."
258,258,It's quite a fair.
259,259,The Butcher himself has got to invite you...
260,260,...or you don't go.
261,261,"Look where you are going, Johnny!"
262,262,"You look stunned and poorly, sir!"
263,263,Quite a pair of conversationists aren't you!
264,264,Maybe not. We're deep thinkers.
265,265,"Gentlemen, I leave you in the grace and favour of the Lord!"
266,266,"Jenny, finest bludget in all the Points."
267,267,She is a prim looking star gazer!
268,268,But I'd check my pockets if I were you.
269,269,Because I do believe she lifted your time piece.
270,270,I let her take it.
271,271,I let here take things all the time.
272,272,Is that right?
273,273,Yeah.
274,274,We always liked a good fire in the Points.
275,275,You generally pick up a swag and if the cops came along...
276,276,...you really got a show.
277,277,The municipal police fought the metropolitan police.
278,278,The metropolitan police fought the streetgangs.
279,279,Hurry up before the Black Joke get here!
280,280,There were 37 amateur fire brigades.
281,281,They all fought each other.
282,282,The Black Joke are on their way!
283,283,"Okay boys, get the hoses!"
284,284,It's the Black Joke!
285,285,Go get 'm boys!
286,286,Give those Bowery boys help!
287,287,Quick before there's nothing left!
288,288,"Go back to the Bowery, ya bum!"
289,289,For gods sake. They're taking everything!
290,290,In your next time of trouble ma'm....
291,291,...call Tammany first!
292,292,It's not too late. You can still save my house!
293,293,Let's go!
294,294,I thought you said you were hungry!
295,295,Grab what you can. Let's get out of here!
296,296,May I point out that this building is burning to ashes?
297,297,And may I point out that this area is the provenance...
298,298,..of my own America's firebrigade.
299,299,And that you lot only belong in the Bowery.
300,300,"May I point out that you are outmanned, outmanouvered..."
301,301,...and at the moment outfought!
302,302,Am I?
303,303,There's the Black Joke!
304,304,Let's get 'm!
305,305,Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.
306,306,"Okay boys, to work!"
307,307,What's the point?
308,308,The fire's near burnt eveything of value inside.
309,309,Boys forget that one.
310,310,Next building over.
311,311,Mustn't let it spread!
312,312,Grab what you want from that one!
313,313,What are you doing? There's nothing wrong with this one!
314,314,Come on. Johnny. Get up!
315,315,Leave that.
316,316,"You two, on your way!"
317,317,His name's Amsterdam.
318,318,How's the beak?
319,319,Ain't so bad.
320,320,You. You got anything or you can get out.
321,321,Is that it?
322,322,That's it.
323,323,Right. Here's the rake.
324,324,Everything comes here we fence it.
325,325,Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives and we chop up....
326,326,"....the winnings, each to his equal portion of the gang."
327,327,"Does that meet with your approval, Hell Gate?"
328,328,My approval?
329,329,"What's the matter Jack Sprat, can't you think for yourself!"
330,330,I'll slit your fucking throat!
331,331,"You boys settle with me, before settling with each other."
332,332,I come for my due and proper.
333,333,This ain't a bad haul.
334,334,"You know, when the folks say the country is going to hell..."
335,335,"...I always tell them, look at all the hard work..."
336,336,..our fine young lads are doing down in the Points.
337,337,"Oh, yeah. This is just the thing for Mrs. Mulraney."
338,338,Alright Happy Jack. Leave us for something to give Bill de Butcher.
339,339,Would ya?
340,340,Not my favorite tune.
341,341,"Thank you, boys."
342,342,You keep out of trouble now.
343,343,Every year the Natives celebrated the killing of my father all over again.
344,344,At Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda in Mott street.
345,345,The chinks hated the Natives worse than we did.
346,346,The drum rolls and the Butcher drinks a glass of fire.
347,347,"When you kill a king, you don't stab him in the dark."
348,348,You kill him where the whole court can watch him die.
349,349,Got any timber?
350,350,"Hi, Maggie. Rightie or leftie?"
351,351,Give us a drink.
352,352,Help yourself.
353,353,Two minutes. Place your bets.
354,354,Gentlemen. The match is due to commence.
355,355,"The count to be is, Rouser against the vermin."
356,356,Satisfied?
357,357,Yes!
358,358,"Where are you going, boil?"
359,359,I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.
360,360,Are you now?
361,361,Give it to me. I'll give it to him.
362,362,No thanks. I'll give it to him myself.
363,363,"What do you want to keep, the money or your teeth?"
364,364,John?
365,365,Welcome.
366,366,"From me and the lads, sir."
367,367,Mate of yours?
368,368,Where's he from?
369,369,"He's not from here, sir."
370,370,YOU!
371,371,That's close enough!
372,372,Your friend can't look me in the eye...
373,373,...that's not an admirable characteristic.
374,374,"No one can look you in the eye, Bill.."
375,375,...not when you're playing cards.
376,376,"This is whist, it's a gentleman's game."
377,377,Make a gentleman's bet.
378,378,"I am betting large, Bill!"
379,379,That ain't large.
380,380,"Don't make that noise again, Harvey."
381,381,I like a man who's willing to burn for his swag.
382,382,How do you fair on water?
383,383,Come closer.
384,384,Closer. I ain't gonna bite!
385,385,There's a Portugese ship lying low in the harbour....
386,386,...quarantined three weeks.
387,387,Get there before the Day Break Boys strip her.
388,388,Maybe you and me wil talk some more.
389,389,"Consider it done, sir."
390,390,Good boy.
391,391,And you...
392,392,...whatever you name is.
393,393,What is your name?
394,394,"Amsterdam, sir."
395,395,Amsterdam?
396,396,I'm New York.
397,397,Don't you ever come in here empty handed again.
398,398,You gotta pay for the pleasure of my company.
399,399,"Take him for a boat ride, John."
400,400,Maybe he'll save your life again.
401,401,"If the Day Break boys catch us on this river, they'll slit our throats!"
402,402,"I'll do it myself, if you don't keep quiet!"
403,403,I never liked the harbour after dark.
404,404,And now each night they brought on shore the bodies of the soldiers.
405,405,So many mothers don't even have the solace of knowing where their sons have fallen.
406,406,I lost my own eldest in Antida.
407,407,His mother and I weren't able to recover his remains.
408,408,It was a mournful sight.
409,409,The war can't last forever.
410,410,But we had business of our own.
411,411,The Day Break boys have already been here.
412,412,There's nothing left. Let's go back.
413,413,What in hell...?
414,414,Jimmy..get down!
415,415,Jezus..that'll bring the harbour cops for sure!
416,416,Out of the way!
417,417,Let's take a look.
418,418,Jezus..they killed everybody!
419,419,There's nothing here but...
420,420,Watch it....dead sea crabs.
421,421,Come on! Let's go.
422,422,Shove off!
423,423,No. Wait for Amsterdam!
424,424,Where is Amsterdam?
425,425,"Take him, damn fool!"
426,426,What in the hell for?
427,427,Look in my glims. I said no less than 15!
428,428,Is this fresh?
429,429,Four hours most.
430,430,"Much obliged, gents."
431,431,What's that word?
432,432,It means bodysnatchers.
433,433,I didn't ask the meaning.
434,434,I asked the word.
435,435,Ghoul?
436,436,Ghoul?
437,437,That's a good word.
438,438,A fresh outrage in the Five Points.
439,439,A notice that you can be proud of.
440,440,Thank you.
441,441,"Low thing, to do that to a body."
442,442,Low.
443,443,Why? They could've left that ship with nothing.
444,444,Instead they made the Police Gazette.
445,445,A periodical of note.
446,446,A body is supposed to stay beneath the earth....
447,447,...wearing a wooden coat...
448,448,..until the resurrection.
449,449,These two are just a pair of bug eating sons of Irish bitches.
450,450,Just like you.
451,451,Don't seem to bother them none.
452,452,Maybe they don't share your religious scruples.
453,453,Maybe they're just a couple of fiddeling bends.
454,454,"I've been called a lot of things, mister..."
455,455,...but I've never been called..?
456,456,Fiddeling bends.
457,457,Fiddeling bends. Right.
458,458,If I knew what in the hell that meant..
459,459,...I might be inclined to take offense.
460,460,A fiddeling bend is a fellow who would steal anything...
461,461,...dead or alive.
462,462,Because he's too low to work up a decent lay for himself.
463,463,Count that careful.
464,464,I'm telling you that's all there is. That's all they gave us.
465,465,That's all they gave us.
466,466,Chiseler!
467,467,"If you had said chiseler, now that's a word I understand."
468,468,Is that what you're calling us?
469,469,"I can think of a number of things to call you, boil!"
470,470,Right. But I asked if you was calling us chiselers?
471,471,Supposing I am?
472,472,"Well, then we got business."
473,473,That we do!
474,474,"Come on, McGloin, it's just a kid."
475,475,"Watch his left, McGloin!"
476,476,"Alright, that'll do."
477,477,"What do you say now, huh?"
478,478,"That'll do, for Christ sake."
479,479,Drag him off.
480,480,"That's enough, kid."
481,481,You got him.
482,482,McGloin? How would that head look without the ears and nose on it?
483,483,"You'd better leave that head alone, Bill."
484,484,I think I'm gonna trim the beak and the ears off that head.
485,485,Make a nice pot of soup out of that head.
486,486,"You can find a tastier head than that, Bill."
487,487,I ain't got no stomach for an Irish stew.
488,488,The mighty McGloin.
489,489,Almost fish hooked by a sprat.
490,490,On the seventh day the Lord rested.
491,491,But before that He did...
492,492,...He squatted over the side of England...
493,493,...and what came out of him?
494,494,Ireland!
495,495,"No offense, son."
496,496,"None taken, sir."
497,497,I grew up here.
498,498,AllI ever knew of Ireland was in the talk of others in the asylum.
499,499,From which part of that excrementitous island were your forebares spawn?
500,500,I've been told Carrey.
501,501,But I lost proof of it in my language in the asylum.
502,502,I was raised in a similar establishment myself.
503,503,"Everything you see belongs to me, to degree or another."
504,504,"But beggars, quick thieves, here in Paradise.."
505,505,"...gymmills, blind tigers on the waterfront..."
506,506,...anglers and the musers. The shehe's and the chinks.
507,507,Everybody owes...
508,508,"...everybody pays, because..."
509,509,"...that's how you stand up, to the rising of the tide."
510,510,Is that right boys?
511,511,"Yes Bill, that's right."
512,512,Enlist. Join up! Serve your country.
513,513,Volunteer and get your 50 dollar bonus!
514,514,"We need 30,000 volunteers.."
515,515,...and we're prepared to pay Please read this. Thank you.
516,516,Would you like one to fill out?
517,517,Young man?
518,518,Enlist and...
519,519,...serve you country.
520,520,"If you're interested, I suggest..."
521,521,"Everywhere you went, people talked about the daft."
522,522,You could buy your way out for 300 dollars.
523,523,But who had 300 dollars?
524,524,For us it had might as well been 3 millions.
525,525,The recruters were too scared of the gangs...
526,526,...to come after us.
527,527,"Besides, we never dreamt the war.."
528,528,...would ever touch New York.
529,529,"Good morning, sir."
530,530,You!
531,531,Don't you run into me.
532,532,Fair enough!
533,533,I said don't run in to me!
534,534,Sorry!
535,535,Everything in place?
536,536,It seems so.
537,537,Then I leave you in the grace and favour of the Lord.
538,538,Thank you.
539,539,Why that dirty...!
540,540,"Oh, no!"
541,541,Allow me!
542,542,"Thank you kindly, sir."
543,543,It's my pleasure.
544,544,I hope you don't mind if I speak...
545,545,..I don't want to appear forward.
546,546,"Well sir, that depends on what you say!"
547,547,"Would you call me wreckless, if I say that you are the prettiest girl in New York?"
548,548,Only New York?
549,549,This is my stop.
550,550,May I walk with you a little then?
551,551,That sir...would be too bold.
552,552,For every lay we had a different name.
553,553,An Angler put a hook on the end of a stick...
554,554,...to drop behind store windows and doors.
555,555,An Autumn diver picked your pocket in church.
556,556,"A Badger, gets a fellow in bed with a girl..."
557,557,..and robs his pockets when they're on the go.
558,558,Jenny was a Bludger..
559,559,...a girl pickpocket.
560,560,And a Turtle dove.
561,561,A Turtle dove goes uptown...
562,562,...dressed like a housemaid.
563,563,Picks out a fine house...
564,564,...and goes right through the back door. Robs you blind.
565,565,It takes a lot of sand to be a Turtle dove.
566,566,I'll have my medal back.
567,567,"Oh, jezus."
568,568,Don't do that again.
569,569,"I said, don't do that!"
570,570,Go back to the Points and let me do my business...
571,571,...or I will open your throat.
572,572,Alright.
573,573,Go on then.
574,574,I would.
575,575,Go on then.
576,576,Give me back my medal.
577,577,Make it quick.
578,578,I don't know which one's yours.
579,579,Suppose I help myself to everything.
580,580,Suppose you do.
581,581,"Shall I walk with you a little, then?"
582,582,What do you suppose a fellow can earn up here in a day?
583,583,Maybe we can pile in together?
584,584,I think you're a bit rough for this game.
585,585,"Besides, I work alone."
586,586,Alone?
587,587,What do you core to the Butcher?
588,588,Nothing.
589,589,Nothing?
590,590,The Butcher and me have a special arrangement.
591,591,I don't want to see you again!
592,592,I don't blame you.
593,593,Pennies in their pockets and hope in their eyes.
594,594,They peer to the west.
595,595,Searching the horizon for a glimpse of land and salvation.
596,596,A glimpse of America.
597,597,"Seeing all this poverty must be most unsettling, Mrs. Schermerhorn?"
598,598,Some days the uptown gangs came to us.
599,599,The Schermerhorns were one of the oldest families in New York.
600,600,They didn't run the city..
601,601,"...but they were listened to quite carefully, by them who did."
602,602,"Commissioner Brunt, said you wanted to view the Points...."
603,603,...in all its splendor an squalor.
604,604,"Spare nothing concerning the conditions, said he!"
605,605,"Nothing except our safety, constable."
606,606,"I'm sure we can be in no danger while we're in the constable's company, my dear!"
607,607,"Quite so, madam. Witness!"
608,608,Shall we continue on?
609,609,You dare to leave it there?
610,610,"Safe as a bank, Mr. Greely."
611,611,They all know it's mine.
612,612,Is that man drunk?
613,613,"Dead as good friday, miss."
614,614,"Good day, Mulraney."
615,615,Boys?
616,616,Jack?
617,617,Slum socialable?
618,618,Track finding. Reform studying.
619,619,May I present...
620,620,"The Schermerhorns hardly require an introduction from you, Jack."
621,621,Mrs. Schermerhorn and her daughter.
622,622,The gentleman of course is...
623,623,Mr. Greely. The famous publisher.
624,624,"It's a pleasure and an honour, sir."
625,625,Of the Tribune.
626,626,I am William Cutting.
627,627,"How do you do, Mr. Cutting?"
628,628,"As of this moment, extremely well."
629,629,How do you do?
630,630,Orange blossom. Delicious!
631,631,Mr. Cutting is...
632,632,What a peach! You had a fine carreer on the stage.
633,633,...one of the Five Points local...
634,634,"Please to meet you, sir."
635,635,..leaders.
636,636,Mr. Greely!
637,637,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cutting."
638,638,The Five Points welcomes you..
639,639,...to these streets...
640,640,..and you shall pas in safety.
641,641,I'll see to their safety.
642,642,"Thank you, Bill."
643,643,This way.
644,644,Good day lads.
645,645,Criminals who brag a dote show.
646,646,He knows who I am!
647,647,"Inderdeed, sir. You are well known in these parts."
648,648,I find that strangely flattering.
649,649,Never did like crushers.
650,650,"Well draw it mild, son."
651,651,Happy Jack don't fill his lungs without me telling him to.
652,652,"Do you think my watch would be safe in that lamp post, Bill?"
653,653,Why don't you hang it up there and see?
654,654,Some day.
655,655,Some day is right.
656,656,Is this the new lad?
657,657,just another bastard I folded in the warmth of my embrace.
658,658,Hey!
659,659,"Just wanted to see your face, son."
660,660,No harm intended.
661,661,You get to know a lot by butchering meat.
662,662,We're made up of the same things.
663,663,Flesh and blood. Tissue. Organs.
664,664,I love to work with pigs.
665,665,"The nearest thing in nature to the flesh of a man, is the flesh a pig."
666,666,"Pig, huh?"
667,667,That's right.
668,668,"This is for you, mother."
669,669,Here you are.
670,670,God bless you.
671,671,She ain't really my mother.
672,672,"I knew that, Bill."
673,673,This is the liver.
674,674,The kidneys. The heart.
675,675,This is a wound.
676,676,The stomach will bleed and bleed.
677,677,This is a kill.
678,678,This is a kill.
679,679,And the artery. This is a kill.
680,680,You try it.
681,681,Go ahead.
682,682,Don't follow the blade on the rib.
683,683,Very good!
684,684,And the artery.
685,685,Bleed 'm slow. Let them think about it for a while.
686,686,Slow death.
687,687,Good!
688,688,You'll each bill the city ..for supplies and services..
689,689,...for which you will receive 10%.
690,690,Bill! Mr. Glour will work out the details. Thank you.
691,691,"That's how we do things around Tammany, gentlemen."
692,692,Who's this?
693,693,"Thank you, boys."
694,694,"Good day, sir."
695,695,You got something on your mind?
696,696,Bill's taking quite a liking to you.
697,697,If you're up to something..
698,698,...I don't want no part in it.
699,699,I was in Hell Gate for I'm just trying to make my way is all...
700,700,...just like you.
701,701,Less of course you got a better notion?
702,702,No.
703,703,I can't get a days work done...
704,704,...for all the good citizens coming here..
705,705,...harrassing me about crime in the Points.
706,706,Some even go so far to accuse Tammany of connivance..
707,707,..in this so called rampant criminality.
708,708,What can I do?
709,709,I can't have this.
710,710,Something has to be done.
711,711,What do you have in mind?
712,712,I don't know. Maybe we should hang someone.
713,713,Who?
714,714,No one important necessarily.
715,715,"Back alley thieves, with no affiliations."
716,716,How many?
717,717,Which?
718,718,Vier.
719,719,You stand here convicted..
720,720,"...of ludeness, jackrolling..."
721,721,"...sneak thievery, chloral hydrating, sodomy.."
722,722,...strangulation and corruption of the public good.
723,723,Chin up.
724,724,Handsome bunch of gallows food!
725,725,There's my old friend.
726,726,"How are you feeling, Arthur?"
727,727,I'm okay. Okay you know.
728,728,Say hello to Amsterdam.
729,729,He nearly fish hooked McGloin.
730,730,Nearly!
731,731,"I see that you are dressed for the occasion, Arthur."
732,732,"You know me, Bill. Always like to look me best."
733,733,That's the spirit.
734,734,Nice locket. I'll give you a dollar for it.
735,735,It's me mother's.
736,736,Dollar and a halve?
737,737,Done.
738,738,"I'll miss you, Arthur."
739,739,"See you in the hot country, Shamus."
740,740,Is my son present here?
741,741,Where's my little fellow?
742,742,Look at your dad.
743,743,Farewell dear boy.
744,744,I never struck a foul blow..
745,745,..or turned a card.
746,746,May God greet me as a friend!
747,747,That night the Reformers held a dance.
748,748,That was the Five Points alright....
749,749,"...hangings in the morning, a dance in the evening."
750,750,To be sure!
751,751,"It's not a matter of words, but by the way she smiles at me."
752,752,"She smiles at a lot of people, John."
753,753,"A penny, for a fighting Irishman?"
754,754,Are you from Carey?
755,755,I am sir.
756,756,It ain't much.
757,757,Thank you.
758,758,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to see so many young faces.."
759,759,...at our first annual mission dance.
760,760,This will be a real circus!
761,761,The mission welcomes Christians of every stamp...
762,762,...and we are happy to greet our Roman catholic friends...
763,763,...who join us here tonight.
764,764,Ladies....come with me.
765,765,We're going to start the dance in just a moment.
766,766,"Good evening, your Holyness."
767,767,"Good evening, Reverend."
768,768,You should have shaved closer!
769,769,"Good evening, Reverend."
770,770,I'd like to make a pardon.
771,771,Miss...?
772,772,Everdeane.
773,773,Miss Everdeane.
774,774,"Gentlemen, over here! If you don't mind."
775,775,Thank you.
776,776,Open it. Hold it up!
777,777,Into the mirror.
778,778,That one!
779,779,Our queen has chosen.
780,780,Sir...
781,781,...your lady!
782,782,Regular services are held in the church at 6 and 8.
783,783,Go to hell.
784,784,What do you think your doing?
785,785,I'm dancing.
786,786,Why did you pick me?
787,787,That's none of your business.
788,788,Would you mind telling me?
789,789,Sorry!
790,790,I'm not much of a dancer.
791,791,Try and stay calm.
792,792,I've never been to a dance before!
793,793,It's best not to look down.
794,794,You can hold me tighter if you like.
795,795,Alright.
796,796,Okay!
797,797,Why didn't you dance with Johnny?
798,798,Because...
799,799,...I didn't want him.
800,800,I'm not good in this.
801,801,Wait!
802,802,What?
803,803,Wait.
804,804,How does this open?
805,805,It takes too long to lace back up...
806,806,...we'll be here all night.
807,807,Alright. I'll take it off.
808,808,There was a baby.
809,809,They cut it out.
810,810,Sorry!
811,811,It's fine.
812,812,Have you got any scars?
813,813,A few.
814,814,What's that then?
815,815,That?
816,816,A gift from Mr. Cutting.
817,817,A gift?
818,818,A gift!
819,819,Was it your birthday?
820,820,No.
821,821,What did you give him?
822,822,The answer to that has nothing to do with you.
823,823,Don't tell me you're angry with me?
824,824,No..I'm through with you.
825,825,"Well, you're quicker then most fellows..."
826,826,...generally they wait till afterwards!
827,827,I ain't interested..
828,828,...in the Butcher's leavings.
829,829,Stay away from the pikers.
830,830,Amsterdam!
831,831,Everyone was working for the Butcher.
832,832,We ran his errands..
833,833,...made his money...
834,834,...took a piece...
835,835,"...and said thank you, sir."
836,836,Gentlemen in the ring!
837,837,Even Tweed!
838,838,The fight's over!
839,839,Even me.
840,840,My father's son.
841,841,What the hell is this?
842,842,"Sorry, Bill."
843,843,The city ordenance against boxing...
844,844,...is a blight. I grant you.
845,845,I'm losing money while you speak.
846,846,Go out there and collect those bets.
847,847,"How do I collect, if no one won the fight?"
848,848,This counts as a no decision.
849,849,"You've got that covered, right?"
850,850,Didn't anyone pay off the god damn police?
851,851,"Yes, the municipal police..."
852,852,...this is the metropolitan police.
853,853,You're going to repay me every cent.
854,854,Wait! Mr. Tweed!
855,855,Who asked for your opinion?
856,856,Let him speak!
857,857,We don't answer to you.
858,858,"The law says there's no boxing in the city, right?"
859,859,"That's right, in the city."
860,860,Where does the city end?
861,861,The winner...in the Allow me to acknowledge the man who's vision..
862,862,"...and enterprise, made possible the staging of this noble combat..."
863,863,"...in this inspiring and entirely legal surroundings, Mr. William Cutting!"
864,864,And his young associate.
865,865,Well done. You're a quick learner.
866,866,We done good.
867,867,We done well.
868,868,May I have your kind attention?
869,869,May I remind you of the wonders of my museum on Broadway...
870,870,...P.T.Barnum's gallery of wonders!
871,871,It's a funny feeling being taken...
872,872,...under the wing of a dragon.
873,873,It's warmer than you think.
874,874,"That's the building of our country right there, Mr. Cutting."
875,875,Americans are borning.
876,876,I don't see no Americans.
877,877,I see trespassers.
878,878,"Irish, who do jobs for a nickel..."
879,879,...that niggers do for a dime...
880,880,...and a white man used to get a quarter for.
881,881,What have they done? Name one thing they've contributed!
882,882,Votes!
883,883,"Votes, you say?"
884,884,They vote on who the Archbishop tells them...
885,885,...and who tells him?
886,886,"Their king in the pointy hat, who sits on his throne in Rome."
887,887,He's got mixed feelings with regards to the Irish.
888,888,"Bill, deliver these good and fervant folk to the polls."
889,889,And there will be a handsome price for each vote that goes Tammany's way.
890,890,Miy father gave his life...
891,891,...making this country what it is.
892,892,"Murdered by the British, with all of his men, July 25 juli, 1814."
893,893,"You think I'm going to help you, befoul his legacy?"
894,894,By giving this country to them...
895,895,...who's had no hand in fighting for it.
896,896,Why? Because they come off the boat crawling with lice...
897,897,...and begging you for soup?
898,898,"You're a great one for the fighting Bill, I know..."
899,899,...but you can't fight forever.
900,900,I can go down doing it .
901,901,And you will.
902,902,What did you say?
903,903,"I said, you're turning you back on the future."
904,904,Not our future.
905,905,That document makes you a citizen...
906,906,...this one makes you a private in the Union army.
907,907,Now go fight for your country.
908,908,Next.
909,909,"Sign here, son."
910,910,Or make your mark.
911,911,Here's your musket. Make sure you keep it dry on the boat.
912,912,Where  are we going?
913,913,I heard Tennessee.
914,914,"Do they feed us now, you think?"
915,915,"My children, my chidren."
916,916,We must heal the divisions between us!
917,917,This war must cease. North and South must stand united.
918,918,What happens at the finish?
919,919,Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!
920,920,Ain't you never been to a theatre before?
921,921,No.
922,922,"Mr Legree, lay down your whip."
923,923,Miss Elisa join hands with mr. Shelby.
924,924,And Topsy. Dear little Topsy.
925,925,Cradle Uncle Tom's head.
926,926,Leave the nigger dead.
927,927,Down with the Union!
928,928,Down with the Union!
929,929,For the blood of the Irish.
930,930,"Bill, get down!"
931,931,Somebody's popped the Butcher!
932,932,Who's man are you?
933,933,Speak smart and speak up!
934,934,What's he saying?
935,935,I think he's making his peace with God.
936,936,To hell with that!
937,937,He makes his peace with me.
938,938,"I'm hearing your confession tonight, you Irish whore!"
939,939,Who's man are you?
940,940,We speak English in this country.
941,941,Who's man are you?
942,942,"Do you see this knife, I'm gonna teach..."
943,943,...you to speak English with this knife!
944,944,Who's man are you?
945,945,Who's man are you?
946,946,Well that didn't tell us very much.
947,947,Fine waist coat.
948,948,"Shame, I don't think it can be mended!"
949,949,Will I keep it as a souvenir?
950,950,Where's Legree? Where's Topsy?
951,951,"Jezus, let's continue."
952,952,Intermission is over.
953,953,Now that was bloody Shakespearian.
954,954,What?
955,955,"Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?"
956,956,He was the fellow who wrote the King James' Bible.
957,957,"Mr., I don't know what you are talking about."
958,958,Because you're an ignorant Irish welp!
959,959,Just like your father.
960,960,That's it. Tear my head off and destruct the world.
961,961,Just like the other stupid Irish in this country.
962,962,That's why I never ran with your dad.
963,963,Get off me you crazy bastard!
964,964,"It means if you're not strong, you'd better be smart."
965,965,I don't know if your being too clever or too dumb.
966,966,"But whatever it is, remember this much."
967,967,"For all his faults, your father was a man who loved his people."
968,968,Amsterdam. Amsterdam. New York is calling you.
969,969,Look at that. What in Christ's name is that?
970,970,"Rythms of the  dark continent, thrown into the kettle..."
971,971,...with an Irish shindig. Stir it around a few times.
972,972,Poured out as a fine American mess.
973,973,"A jig, doing a jig!"
974,974,A little keep sake.
975,975,"Good on ya, sir."
976,976,Come upstairs with me Bill.
977,977,Have I ever had you before?
978,978,So you don't call me by my christian name.
979,979,Bill. My god you're alright!
980,980,I heard the news and came over as quick as I could.
981,981,As timely as the angel of death.
982,982,You're not suggesting that I would stoop to what your suggesting?
983,983,Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you...
984,984,...you'd be in a wooden coat.
985,985,I've got a hole in my shoulder and it hurts...
986,986,...so have a drink and shut up.
987,987,Or shut up and get out.
988,988,I believe I'll have a drink.
989,989,"Carefull, Tweedy the morts are frenchified!"
990,990,"No, I'm clean."
991,991,Jenny.
992,992,Bill.
993,993,I'll wrap you up.
994,994,It's gotta be tight.
995,995,Loves to make me cry.
996,996,You can take it!
997,997,There's my boy.
998,998,It's alright.
999,999,To the Butcher!
1000,1000,We're all much obliged.
1001,1001,Forever.
1002,1002,To the Butcher!
1003,1003,"Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?"
1004,1004,Go on. Go!
1005,1005,Is there anyone in the Five Points you haven't fucked?
1006,1006,Yes!
1007,1007,You!
1008,1008,Belt down!
1009,1009,Try it and I'll bite ya.
1010,1010,You were gonna bite me.
1011,1011,I dont think you want me.
1012,1012,Find out.
1013,1013,"Oh, Jenny!"
1014,1014,I can't sleep.
1015,1015,"I hope you don't mind us laying here, sir?"
1016,1016,"Whatever takes your fancy, young friend."
1017,1017,Is your shoulder keeping you up?
1018,1018,I don't sleep too much.
1019,1019,I sleep with one eye open. I only got one eye.
1020,1020,How old are you Amsterdam?
1021,1021,Not too sure. Never did figure it.
1022,1022,I'm 47.
1023,1023,You know how I stayed alive this long? All these years.
1024,1024,Fear!
1025,1025,The spectacle of fearsome acts.
1026,1026,"Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands."
1027,1027,"He offends me, I cut out his tongue."
1028,1028,"He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike!"
1029,1029,"Raise it high up, so all in the streets can see."
1030,1030,That's what preserves the order of things.
1031,1031,Fear.
1032,1032,That one tonight. Who was he?
1033,1033,A nobody. A coward.
1034,1034,What an end that would have been.
1035,1035,I killed the last honourable man Since then....
1036,1036,You've seen his portrait downstairs?
1037,1037,Has your mouth been glued up with juice?
1038,1038,I asked you a question!
1039,1039,"I said I've seen it, sir."
1040,1040,You got a murderous rage in you.
1041,1041,I like it.
1042,1042,So much life boiling up in you.
1043,1043,That's good!
1044,1044,The priest and me lived by the same principles.
1045,1045,Only faith divided us.
1046,1046,He gave me this you know?
1047,1047,That was the finest beating I ever took.
1048,1048,My face was pulp. My guts pierced.
1049,1049,My ribs all messed up.
1050,1050,When he came to finish me...
1051,1051,...I couldn't look him in the eye.
1052,1052,He spared me because...
1053,1053,....he wanted me to live in shame.
1054,1054,This was a great man.
1055,1055,A great man.
1056,1056,So I cut out the eye that looked away.
1057,1057,Sent it to him wrapped in blue paper.
1058,1058,I would've cut them both out if I could afford being blind.
1059,1059,I rose up again with a full heart...
1060,1060,...and buried him in his own blood.
1061,1061,Well done!
1062,1062,He was the only man I killed worth remembering.
1063,1063,I never had a son.
1064,1064,Civilisation is crumbling.
1065,1065,God bless you!
1066,1066,If you've got anything to say...
1067,1067,...now is the time to say it.
1068,1068,"Who is he to you, Jenny?"
1069,1069,I was 12 years old.
1070,1070,My mother was dead. I was living in a doorway.
1071,1071,He took me in. Took care of me in his own way.
1072,1072,After they cut out the baby...
1073,1073,He doesn't fancy girls that scarred up.
1074,1074,"You should know, in your own mind..."
1075,1075,...that he never laid a hand on me till I asked him too.
1076,1076,Who are you?
1077,1077,Who are you?
1078,1078,"Gentlemen, you are most welcome to this palace of enchantment..."
1079,1079,...with visions to rival the tales of Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!
1080,1080,Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!
1081,1081,Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...
1082,1082,...of these creatures.
1083,1083,"Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!"
1084,1084,How would you like to make them sing?
1085,1085,They could be singing for you.
1086,1086,May God put the spirit of the holy steel in my spine...
1087,1087,...and the love of the blessed Virgin in my heart.
1088,1088,Amen.
1089,1089,Easy now. What did you say?
1090,1090,He's not who he says he is.
1091,1091,He's not who he says he is?
1092,1092,Count you blessings he considers you a friend!
1093,1093,The only thing he considers every day and night is how to kill you!
1094,1094,Those eyes want me to take them out for you!
1095,1095,I'll bury it up you fundunem where it belongs!
1096,1096,I can read right through them!
1097,1097,They're empty...
1098,1098,His name is Vallon.
1099,1099,Don't do it Bill!
1100,1100,His name is Vallon!
1101,1101,Curious people these celestials.
1102,1102,You know why they use short sleeves?
1103,1103,So everyone can see he's got nothing stashed.
1104,1104,I hope it doesn't become a fashion.
1105,1105,Johnny?
1106,1106,Get up!
1107,1107,"Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your kind attention."
1108,1108,As some of you have surely noticed...
1109,1109,"...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting..."
1110,1110,..is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction!
1111,1111,"May we appeal to him, to favour us..."
1112,1112,...with another exciting exhibition.
1113,1113,Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!
1114,1114,What's gonna happen?
1115,1115,The spider's kiss!
1116,1116,The wheel of death!
1117,1117,William Tell!
1118,1118,The butterfly!
1119,1119,The spider's kiss!
1120,1120,The Butcher's apprentice!
1121,1121,The Butcher's apprentice!
1122,1122,A command performance!
1123,1123,Where have you been?
1124,1124,A command performance indeed.
1125,1125,I want you to get out of here!
1126,1126,"And for this, I must beg the indulgence..."
1127,1127,...of my former...
1128,1128,... assistent in matters of impailment...
1129,1129,...the Butcher's original apprentice.
1130,1130,"What do you say, Jen?"
1131,1131,One more time for the sweet souvenir.
1132,1132,Come on!
1133,1133,Don't do it!
1134,1134,She'll be alright.
1135,1135,Remember this?
1136,1136,Of course!
1137,1137,"You may feel more comfortable without that garment, Miss Everdeane!"
1138,1138,"You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill!"
1139,1139,Anything in your pockets tonight?
1140,1140,I ain't started working yet.
1141,1141,What about that locket I gave you?
1142,1142,Apologies my dear. Pick it up.
1143,1143,Whoopsie daisy!
1144,1144,Now its good and broke!
1145,1145,I can't seem to get anything right tonight.
1146,1146,You got the sand to give 'm a grand finale?
1147,1147,Maybe when you're aiming a little straighter.
1148,1148,Enough of this heathen music.
1149,1149,Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
1150,1150,Strike up boys!
1151,1151,This is a night for Americans!
1152,1152,Jenny!
1153,1153,Hats off!
1154,1154,We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers...
1155,1155,...whose blood stains the very streets...
1156,1156,...we walk today.
1157,1157,"Also on this night, we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies."
1158,1158,An honourable man...
1159,1159,...who crossed over bravely.
1160,1160,Fighting for what he believed in.
1161,1161,"To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life..."
1162,1162,... and consume him as I consume these flames.
1163,1163,In honour of Priest Vallon.
1164,1164,In honour of Priest Vallon!
1165,1165,That's a wound !
1166,1166,I want you all to meet the son of Priest Vallon.
1167,1167,I took him under my wing...
1168,1168,...and see how I'm repaid.
1169,1169,He saved my life one day so he could kill me the next...
1170,1170,...like a sneak thief.
1171,1171,Instead of fighting like a man.
1172,1172,A base defiler. Unworthy of a noble name.
1173,1173,That'll do Mcgloin.
1174,1174,Spread him out.
1175,1175,I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.
1176,1176,This is fresh meat!
1177,1177,We need to tenderise this meat a bit.
1178,1178,"Alright, lets kiss goodnight to that pretty face of yours!"
1179,1179,No...!
1180,1180,What'll it be then. Rib or chop.
1181,1181,Loin or shank.
1182,1182,The liver!
1183,1183,The spleen!
1184,1184,The kidney!
1185,1185,The lung!
1186,1186,The liver!
1187,1187,The tongue!
1188,1188,The heart! The heart!
1189,1189,The heart?
1190,1190,This boy has no heart.
1191,1191,Then kill him!
1192,1192,He ain't earned the death!
1193,1193,He ain't earned the death of my hands!
1194,1194,He'll walk amongst you marked with shame.
1195,1195,A freak. Worthy of Barnum's museum of wonders.
1196,1196,"God's only man, speared by the Butcher."
1197,1197,Here. Here. This way.
1198,1198,Come on.
1199,1199,I want to show you something.
1200,1200,My mother's bones share this grave.
1201,1201,I've saved 20 cents out of every dollar I've ever earned since ....
1202,1202,...I was thirteen.
1203,1203,That's 215 dollars.
1204,1204,For bludgeoning and the rest.
1205,1205,This is what I wanted to show you.
1206,1206,"This is where we're going to go, as soon as you get better...."
1207,1207,"...San Fransisco, California."
1208,1208,You can have anything you want out there.
1209,1209,These men are pulling gold right out of the river.
1210,1210,With their own hands.
1211,1211,We're here and need to get there.
1212,1212,Start here.
1213,1213,Go down 'round here.
1214,1214,Up to San Francisco.
1215,1215,The shortest way to go.
1216,1216,Will you go with me?
1217,1217,"No need to fire that, miss."
1218,1218,Or even aim it.
1219,1219,An audience with yor mangled friend is all I want.
1220,1220,I've 44 notches on my club.
1221,1221,Do you know what they are for?
1222,1222,To remind me of what I owe God when I die.
1223,1223,My father was killed in battle too.
1224,1224,"In Ireland, in the streets."
1225,1225,Fighting those who were taking their privilege.
1226,1226,What only could be got and held...
1227,1227,...by the decimation of a race.
1228,1228,That war is a thousand years old and more.
1229,1229,We never expected it to follow us here.
1230,1230,It didn't.
1231,1231,It was waiting for us when we landed.
1232,1232,Your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe.
1233,1233,That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.
1234,1234,"I often wondered, if he'd lived a bit longer..."
1235,1235,...would he have wanted it to be more.
1236,1236,Why did you rifle through his pockets then?
1237,1237,For safekeeping.
1238,1238,I thought maybe you could do with it.
1239,1239,Blood stays on the blade.
1240,1240,That's a sorry looking pelt.
1241,1241,And it's been so nice and quiet for the last three months.
1242,1242,"Tell me, this charge. Does it sit on easy with you?"
1243,1243,"No. Not uneasy , Bill."
1244,1244,I wouldn't say that.
1245,1245,But... my allegiance is to the law.
1246,1246,I'm paid to uphold the law.
1247,1247,What in heaven's name are you talking about?
1248,1248,"You may have misgivings, but don't go believing that, Jack. That way lies damnation."
1249,1249,"I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill."
1250,1250,Here's the thing.
1251,1251,I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...
1252,1252,..you meatheaded shit sack.
1253,1253,That's more or less the thing.
1254,1254,I want you to go out there. You and nobody else.
1255,1255,None of your little minions.
1256,1256,I want you to go out there...
1257,1257,...and I want you...
1258,1258,"...to punish, the person..."
1259,1259,...who's responsible...
1260,1260,...for murdering this poor little rabbit.
1261,1261,Is that understood?
1262,1262,Right!
1263,1263,Help yourself to some decent meat on the way out.
1264,1264,Damn it!
1265,1265,"Is that you, boy?"
1266,1266,I didn't mean nothing by that shot you know?
1267,1267,You scared me is all.
1268,1268,You know I'd never do you harm.
1269,1269,"Come out now, lad."
1270,1270,Remember your father and me?
1271,1271,Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?
1272,1272,The times we had.
1273,1273,You know I won't hurt you.
1274,1274,This is bad for everybody.
1275,1275,"What's next, dead politicians?"
1276,1276,I could spare half a dozen of you...
1277,1277,...easier than I can spare him.
1278,1278,"Still, I think it shows dash."
1279,1279,"Give the boy some time, we'll settle with a good dust up."
1280,1280,The lads!
1281,1281,There are more of us coming off the ships each day.
1282,1282,"I heard 15,000 Irish a week."
1283,1283,And we're afraid of the Natives!
1284,1284,Get all of us together...
1285,1285,....we ain't got a gang..
1286,1286,...we got an army.
1287,1287,"And all we need is a spark. One spark, to wake us all up."
1288,1288,It was me who played you false.
1289,1289,I'd take it back if I could.
1290,1290,Take it back?
1291,1291,"Johnny, I ought to kill you!"
1292,1292,Get out of the Points and don't come back.
1293,1293,"Where are you going, boil?"
1294,1294,Come along.
1295,1295,Come on.
1296,1296,"Tell us John, what's the trouble?"
1297,1297,"No trouble, Bill."
1298,1298,Still hiding out with your friends?
1299,1299,"No, I'm not with them, Bill."
1300,1300,"I'm with you, with the Natives."
1301,1301,"You always were a Native, as far as I'm interested, John."
1302,1302,Till you became a stag.
1303,1303,You tell me you're a Native?
1304,1304,Do you want to know what a Native is?
1305,1305,"A Native is a man, who's willing to give his life..."
1306,1306,...for his country.
1307,1307,Like my father done.
1308,1308,"Are you willing to do that, my young friend?"
1309,1309,John? Johnny?
1310,1310,Johnny?
1311,1311,I'll get you off.
1312,1312,It hurts too much.
1313,1313,Just kill me.
1314,1314,Just kill me.
1315,1315,Please. Please.
1316,1316,Please. Please.
1317,1317,Please.
1318,1318,"I'm sorry, Johnny."
1319,1319,"Oh, Mary mother of God, pray for us sinners..."
1320,1320,...on the day of our death...amen.
1321,1321,"Rest in peace, Ma."
1322,1322,"What are you doing here, boil?"
1323,1323,What's that nigger doing in this church?
1324,1324,"What's a Dead Rabbit doing with the Natives,huh?"
1325,1325,No niggers among the Natives.
1326,1326,Niggers as robbers is one thing...
1327,1327,"...but niggers in a church, that's something else!"
1328,1328,"You run with the Natives, you go pray with the Natives!"
1329,1329,You're going to wind up on a stake like your man did!
1330,1330,McGloin?
1331,1331,"Father! Jezus, do you know there's a nigger in your church?"
1332,1332,Jezus!
1333,1333,The earth turns...
1334,1334,...but we don't feel it move.
1335,1335,And one night you look up...
1336,1336,...one spark and the skie's on fire.
1337,1337,It's a touching spectacle.
1338,1338,We'll come back when you're ready for us.
1339,1339,The past is the torch that lights our way.
1340,1340,Where our fathers have shown us the path.
1341,1341,We shall follow.
1342,1342,Our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies...
1343,1343,...for thereby shall we lift our people up...
1344,1344,...against those who will destroy us.
1345,1345,"Our name is called the Dead Rabbits, to remind all of our suffering..."
1346,1346,...and as a call to those who suffer still...
1347,1347,...to join our ranks.
1348,1348,However so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea.
1349,1349,"For with great numbers, must come great strength."
1350,1350,For the salvation of our people.
1351,1351,We don't want your business.
1352,1352,How many other men live here?
1353,1353,You all have to register.
1354,1354,You can't force me to join no army.
1355,1355,Have you got 300 dollars?
1356,1356,Of course not!
1357,1357,Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
1358,1358,"If you are drafted, release from militairy service can only be secured..."
1359,1359,"...for 300 dollars, according to the conscription act."
1360,1360,Otherwise you have to serve!
1361,1361,Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
1362,1362,"You have to serve, sir!"
1363,1363,You tell me!
1364,1364,Boys!
1365,1365,"I was born here, sir. You immigrated here!"
1366,1366,Sweet jezus. War does terrible things to men.
1367,1367,"Get back up town, where you belong!"
1368,1368,man's war!
1369,1369,"Sir, I request an audience with this man."
1370,1370,Don't they speak English in New York anymore!
1371,1371,Don't understand.
1372,1372,You do speak English!
1373,1373,I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle her rifle in another direction?
1374,1374,"I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand the value of this sort of publicity?"
1375,1375,"The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder with half the Irish in the Five Points."
1376,1376,"I'm offering my boy, to form an alliance with you..."
1377,1377,...against Bill Cutting and his slate of Native candidates.
1378,1378,"I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for every Irish vote..."
1379,1379,"...you send Tammany's way, in the coming elections."
1380,1380,"I need a new friend in the Five Points, son."
1381,1381,I'd like that friend to be you.
1382,1382,"Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed."
1383,1383,Suppose we do get you those votes.
1384,1384,Would you back an Irish candidate of my chosing..
1385,1385,I don't think so.
1386,1386,What if we get you all the Irish votes?
1387,1387,"Mr. Vallon, that will only happen in the reign of Queen Dick!"
1388,1388,Beg your pardon?
1389,1389,That means it will never happen.
1390,1390,Now I might be persuaded to back an Irish candidate...
1391,1391,"...for, let's say alderman."
1392,1392,Alderman?
1393,1393,We've already got an Irish alderman.
1394,1394,"So we have, that's why...."
1395,1395,What's bigger than an alderman?
1396,1396,Sheriff!
1397,1397,Sheriff!
1398,1398,"Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an Irishman for sheriff..."
1399,1399,...of the city and county of New York...
1400,1400,...and we'll get him elected.
1401,1401,"I love the Irish, son..."
1402,1402,..but higher than alderman you shall never climb.
1403,1403,Why not?
1404,1404,"For one thing, no man living can consolidate the Irish vote."
1405,1405,I can!
1406,1406,"And for another, I mean no offence..."
1407,1407,...no one's yet found an Irish candidate...
1408,1408,...for sheriff worth voting for.
1409,1409,Monk!
1410,1410,Here.
1411,1411,Got me looking as sober as me own grandfather!
1412,1412,"He was a great man, I'm sure."
1413,1413,He was a drunken bastard.
1414,1414,Can I say what I want?
1415,1415,That's why I wanted you.
1416,1416,Our elected representatives are a gang of thieves!
1417,1417,Who swear to better our lot...
1418,1418,...while dipping their hands deep into our pockets.
1419,1419,I stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like Bill Cutting...
1420,1420,"....against any, an all in roads in our democracy."
1421,1421,"I'll see to it, that no one takes away..."
1422,1422,... what you earned by pluck and application.
1423,1423,To invading hordes of Hibernians.
1424,1424,Go to the polls and put your mark...
1425,1425,... next to the name Walter McGinn.
1426,1426,"Against the potatoes weeders, like them over there..."
1427,1427,...thieving our jobs.
1428,1428,Why should so many Irish die down south...
1429,1429,...when the first war to win...
1430,1430,"...is not down in Dixie, but right here..."
1431,1431,...in these streets!
1432,1432,Who's the finest streetfighter in the Five Points?
1433,1433,Monk!
1434,1434,That's right and let the whole damn city hear it!
1435,1435,That man was right born for this.
1436,1436,He's killed 44 men and laid low a couple of hundred more.
1437,1437,Is that right?
1438,1438,Right.
1439,1439,I should have run him for mayor!
1440,1440,"Alright, line 'm up."
1441,1441,It's election day!
1442,1442,"Come on, you bastard. We need your vote."
1443,1443,Bastard? I fought for you nigger...
1444,1444,...I lost an arm for you!
1445,1445,"Well, that's a start. Come on."
1446,1446,"Rise and shine, rise and shine."
1447,1447,"This great country of ours, even hop fiends get their vote."
1448,1448,"Less heart and more haste, darling."
1449,1449,Where are you going ?
1450,1450,I already voted today.
1451,1451,"Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!"
1452,1452,Twice.
1453,1453,Twice?
1454,1454,Only twice? You call that doing your civic duty?
1455,1455,Come with me.
1456,1456,"Oh no, you don't. Get back and sit down."
1457,1457,Here's another one!
1458,1458,Clean him up good.
1459,1459,Shave the beards off boys and send them back to vote again.
1460,1460,"Okay boys, vote Tammany."
1461,1461,Tammany!
1462,1462,What our great city needs is a new court house.
1463,1463,"Now I propose it should be a modest, economical structure."
1464,1464,Excuse me one moment.
1465,1465,What is it?
1466,1466,"Monk's already won by 3,000 more votes, then there are voters."
1467,1467,"Only 3? Make it 20, 30."
1468,1468,"We don't need a victory, we need a Roman triumph."
1469,1469,We don't have anymore ballots.
1470,1470,Remember the first rule of politics...
1471,1471,...ballots don't make the results...
1472,1472,..the counters do. Keep counting.
1473,1473,It's from Bill.
1474,1474,Monk?
1475,1475,Citizens of the Five Points!
1476,1476,Mr. Cutting is attempting to draw me...
1477,1477,...into an argument...
1478,1478,...that would no doubt end in bloodshed...
1479,1479,...and the compromising of my office.
1480,1480,What do you think?
1481,1481,"Shall I engage in silence, this relic of the ancient law..."
1482,1482,"...or, shall I be your chosen voice..."
1483,1483,"...in a new testament, in a new world?"
1484,1484,"There you are, Bill."
1485,1485,The people have spoken.
1486,1486,The very notion of violent reprisal benumbs them.
1487,1487,Come on up.
1488,1488,Let's see if we can resolve our...
1489,1489,...grievances the democratic way.
1490,1490,"That my friends, is the minority vote."
1491,1491,"Now you tasted my mutton, how do you like it?"
1492,1492,"Look, I want you to see this."
1493,1493,"This is you, right here!"
1494,1494,"Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard."
1495,1495,Why don't you burn him?
1496,1496,See if his ashes turn green.
1497,1497,Fortune favours them all!
1498,1498,You killed an elected official?
1499,1499,Who elected him?
1500,1500,You don't know what you've done to yourself.
1501,1501,I know your works.
1502,1502,You're neither cold nor hot.
1503,1503,So because you are luke warm...
1504,1504,...I will spew you out of my mouth.
1505,1505,You can build your filthy world without me.
1506,1506,"I took the father, now I'll take the son."
1507,1507,"You tell young Vallon, I'm going to paint..."
1508,1508,...Paradise square with his blood.
1509,1509,Two coats!
1510,1510,I'll festoon my sleeping chamber with his guts.
1511,1511,As for you Mr. Tammany fucking hall...
1512,1512,...you come down to the Points once more...
1513,1513,...and you'll be dispatched by my own hand!
1514,1514,Now get back to your celebration...
1515,1515,...and let me eat in peace.
1516,1516,I paid you fair.
1517,1517,Down!
1518,1518,Raise!
1519,1519,You son of a bitch!
1520,1520,Challenge.
1521,1521,Challenge accepted.
1522,1522,And then it came...
1523,1523,...the first day of the draft.
1524,1524,Thomas O'neill.
1525,1525,Andrew Lewis.
1526,1526,Joseph Flynn.
1527,1527,They read out the draftees names as if they were dead already.
1528,1528,J.B. Gleeson.
1529,1529,The O'Conell Guard.
1530,1530,The Plug Uglies.
1531,1531,As for us.
1532,1532,The Forty Thieves.
1533,1533,The tribes were gathered.
1534,1534,The Chichesters.
1535,1535,The drums were beating.
1536,1536,The Dead Rabbits.
1537,1537,The American guard.
1538,1538,The Atlantic Guard.
1539,1539,The Slaughterhouses.
1540,1540,The Bowery Boys.
1541,1541,Confederation of American Natives.
1542,1542,James Mooney.
1543,1543,But all we could see...
1544,1544,...was the hand in front of us.
1545,1545,Shaun O'Connell.
1546,1546,C.W. Morris.
1547,1547,When?
1548,1548,Whenever you like.
1549,1549,Daybreak tomorrow.
1550,1550,Ground?
1551,1551,Paradise square.
1552,1552,Weapons?
1553,1553,That I leave up to you.
1554,1554,"Bricks, bats, axes, knives."
1555,1555,Pistols?
1556,1556,No pistols.
1557,1557,Good boy.
1558,1558,Terms are resolved.
1559,1559,Counsel is concluded.
1560,1560,To hell with your damned draft.
1561,1561,Get 'm boys.
1562,1562,Rip 'm apart.
1563,1563,Kill the rich bastards.
1564,1564,Hotel!
1565,1565,They're not getting my son!
1566,1566,Uptown town at the draft office...
1567,1567,...the cops broke a few skulls.
1568,1568,And everybody ran away.
1569,1569,But the word was spreading...
1570,1570,...in the dark.
1571,1571,"Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns and their mob..."
1572,1572,...breathed a little easy.
1573,1573,"Just a brief blist of anger, over Mr. Lincoln's draft."
1574,1574,Entirely justifiable in my view.
1575,1575,There are two sides to that question.
1576,1576,"Ther are several sides to that question, Mr. Schermerhorn."
1577,1577,But only one right side.
1578,1578,"As with any question, it holds the abuse..."
1579,1579,...of any executive power.
1580,1580,"In any case, Mr. Greely..."
1581,1581,"...we can all be thankful, it wasn't any worse."
1582,1582,"It may be worse yet, sir."
1583,1583,I saw them. I don't know what to think...
1584,1584,"What is it you are so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?"
1585,1585,"Mr. Greely, you won't like this..."
1586,1586,...but what is it?
1587,1587,I don't remember.
1588,1588,You can always hire one half of the poor...
1589,1589,...to kill the other half.
1590,1590,I've come to say goodbye.
1591,1591,I've booked passage for California.
1592,1592,"Jenny, give me one more day and I'll go with you."
1593,1593,You'll be dead by then.
1594,1594,What would you have me do?
1595,1595,I don't know.
1596,1596,This will all be finished tomorrow.
1597,1597,No it won't.
1598,1598,This whole place is going to burn anyway.
1599,1599,I've heard of the poor are going from door to door...
1600,1600,"...in the Five Points, asking those supporters for further riots..."
1601,1601,...to place a candle in the window.
1602,1602,"Irish, Poles, Germans."
1603,1603,"Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad..."
1604,1604,...I prophesise a dark night.
1605,1605,Nobody goes to work today.
1606,1606,We're shutting the factories down!
1607,1607,When the sun rose next...
1608,1608,...the city had split in half.
1609,1609,From all over New York they came...
1610,1610,"...ironworkers, factory boys, street cleaners!"
1611,1611,"Irish, Polish, German..."
1612,1612,...anyone who never cared about slavery in the Union.
1613,1613,Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.
1614,1614,Let the sons of the rich...
1615,1615,....go and die they cried.
1616,1616,Let the sons of the poor...
1617,1617,...stay home.
1618,1618,The earth was shaking now.
1619,1619,But I was about my father's business.
1620,1620,"Oh, mighty Lord..."
1621,1621,...you are the dagger in my hand.
1622,1622,Guide my hand on this day of vengeance.
1623,1623,We give thanks to the Lord....
1624,1624,...for He is good.
1625,1625,"With you, the swift cannot flee."
1626,1626,Nor the strong escape.
1627,1627,"Let my sword devour, till its thirst is quenched with blood...."
1628,1628,...and my enemy sleeps forever.
1629,1629,For you and the God of retribution.
1630,1630,For the Lord crushes the wicked.
1631,1631,The Lord is merciful.
1632,1632,And his love endures forever.
1633,1633,Amen.
1634,1634,Amen.
1635,1635,Amen.
1636,1636,Get the women upstairs!
1637,1637,From 18th precinct. The mob is ransacking houses...
1638,1638,....in 27th street and 7th avenue.
1639,1639,We have no force to send.
1640,1640,From 15th precinct.
1641,1641,All the stores are closing on From fear of the mob in 17th street.
1642,1642,From 4th.
1643,1643,The rioters are attacking coloured boarding houses...
1644,1644,...robbing them and setting them on fire.
1645,1645,From 21st.
1646,1646,The mob have just broken open a gun store...
1647,1647,...on 3rd avenue and are arming.
1648,1648,Marshall's office on 3rd avenue is burning down.
1649,1649,The police is of no avail.
1650,1650,"Show yourself, please!"
1651,1651,Two coloured men brought in almost dead.
1652,1652,There are 50 more outside.
1653,1653,They need help.
1654,1654,The blacks are being attacked all over the city.
1655,1655,There's the 300 dollar man!
1656,1656,Get him!
1657,1657,Did your daddy buy you out of the army!
1658,1658,Can he buy me out of the army too?
