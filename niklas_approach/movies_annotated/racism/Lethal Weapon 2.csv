437,437,"Cute, huh?"
438,438,RIGGS: lt's a dogfest.
439,439,Did you get the whole 1 01 ?
440,440,I know. I got a little carried away with puppies.
441,441,Kid'll probably hate dogs.
442,442,"You know, Lorna, we never ever talked about marriage."
443,443,"Well, l sort of figured you didn't want that."
444,444,You want to get married?
445,445,"Well, no."
446,446,Me neither.
447,447,You want some breakfast?
448,448,Yeah. Yeah.
449,449,Serve and Protect.
450,450,Since when do you read this smut?
451,451,"lt's not smut, it's Ebony Clark."
452,452,Ebony Clark.
453,453,Trish gave it to me.
454,454,"""Every fiber in his being desired her."
455,455,"He devoured her with his eyes."" Hey. Can we try this thing on page 1 96 sometime?"
456,456,Whew.
457,457,There's a good one on 1 68.
458,458,Maybe later.
459,459,Nothing comes between a pregnant lady and a meal.
460,460,"Have l ever ""made your womanhood reach peaks..."
461,461,"...that would rival the highest Himalayas""?"
462,462,"Foothills of Malibu, maybe."
463,463,Not even a Teton?
464,464,l don't think so.
465,465,Thanks.
466,466,I thought I'd at least rate the Rockies.
467,467,"Well, you know l'm kidding."
468,468,You're just saying that to make me feel better.
469,469,"No, I'm not. No, l'm not."
470,470,You know I'm playing.
471,471,"I've been to plenty of mountaintops with you, Riggs."
472,472,It's just that l'm hungry.
473,473,"When you have that kid, we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens."
474,474,l brought you a doughnut.
475,475,A doughnut. Police food.
476,476,How did you know?
477,477,I dropped by lnternal Affairs yesterday.
478,478,Really? How's the rat squad?
479,479,"l picked something up, good one."
480,480,Some cheese?
481,481,"Oh, yeah. I.A. got an anonymous tip."
482,482,The person said Roger's on the take.
483,483,"No, he's not."
484,484,I know he's not. It's probably some jerk he put away.
485,485,But with the new boats and putting two kids through college...
486,486,...l thought you ought to know.
487,487,I actually tried to persuade him to take money.
488,488,"Oh! Stop it, Riggs!"
489,489,I can't hear that! Nothing!
490,490,I won't say anything anymore.
491,491,I'm kidding.
492,492,That's awful.
493,493,l'm kidding.
494,494,Don't tell him l said it.
495,495,He's got enough problems...
496,496,"...he'll blow his top, it'll be awful."
497,497,Just don't say anything.
498,498,What do you mean?
499,499,Like what?
500,500,"ln general, problems."
501,501,You mean something specific.
502,502,I got a nose for these things.
503,503,"Come on, tell me. What?"
504,504,"No, you know, you're pushing me."
505,505,I don't want you to go there.
506,506,Get it off your chest.
507,507,You'll feel better. Tell me.
508,508,I won't leave you alone till you tell me.
509,509,LORNA: Son of a bitch.
510,510,Tell me.
511,511,I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells! I can't believe l said that!
512,512,What? What?
513,513,l'm drooling. What?
514,514,"Oh, Riggs."
515,515,"Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll never say a word about this ever."
516,516,"l swear, I swear."
517,517,Right hand!
518,518,"I swear l won't, ever."
519,519,I promise. What?
520,520,You know how Roger is about his daughter dating cops.
521,521,He'd kill them. So?
522,522,"Rianne married one, he's her baby's father."
523,523,She's too afraid to tell Roger.
524,524,"They met, fell in love."
525,525,"She got pregnant, they got hitched."
526,526,And nobody's telling Roger about this?
527,527,"After the baby's born, Riggs."
528,528,You mean it's a package deal?
529,529,"Here it is, take it or leave it? Ha, ha, ha."
530,530,Does Trish know about this?
531,531,"Yeah, she knows."
532,532,She doesn't know you know.
533,533,But Trish knows.
534,534,Who's the lucky soontobedead soninlaw?
535,535,Riggs.
536,536,Who?
537,537,Sergeant Lee Butters.
538,538,Oh. Oh. This just gets better and better!
539,539,No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
540,540,"Brings him apples, blankets, coffee...."
541,541,"Okay, okay. Not a word."
542,542,"I'm telling you, nothing."
543,543,You kidding? l won't tell. He'd shoot me just for being the messenger.
544,544,He's my best friend. lt'd be wrong to mess with him. I promise. I won't.
545,545,Promise.
546,546,"LORNA: We don't have to discuss boys' names, period, because we're having a girl."
547,547,Okay. Piadora.
548,548,l like Piadora. That's sweet.
549,549,Yeah?
550,550,KNOCKlNG Can't live with that.
551,551,l love that name.
552,552,We're talking kids' names.
553,553,Has Rianne picked any out?
554,554,Need all the help we can get.
555,555,We don't want to double up.
556,556,"Oscar for the boy, Loreen if it's a girl."
557,557,I like Lee Butter.
558,558,Better! l like it better.
559,559,Don't get me started.
560,560,LORNA: I like those names.
561,561,MURTAUGH: Captain wants to see us downtown.
562,562,Trish'll be right down.
563,563,Have fun shopping for the baby.
564,564,"RIGGS: Byebye, honey."
565,565,Yeah.
566,566,Who had the sleepover?
567,567,Just airing out camping gear.
568,568,We're out of here.
569,569,Wow. Something smells good.
570,570,LORNA: Really good!
571,571,Trish has food on the stove.
572,572,We're out of here.
573,573,That smells like Chinese food.
574,574,MURTAUGH: Chinese food?
575,575,She's into Chinese cooking.
576,576,RIGGS: I gotta see this. Can l taste?
577,577,l love Chinese food.
578,578,"MURTAUGH: Hold it! Please, Lorna."
579,579,Please.
580,580,There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
581,581,I saw him.
582,582,A couple of Chinese people.
583,583,Actually a whole family.
584,584,Large family.
585,585,"Oh. Hey, guys! What's up?"
586,586,Hey.
587,587,Hello.
588,588,MURTAUGH: Yeah.
589,589,lt does smell good.
590,590,Great.
591,591,They were hiding in the lifeboat.
592,592,They were?
593,593,"MURTAUGH: With what the lNS guy said, I had to do something."
594,594,So you brought them home.
595,595,lt took two trips.
596,596,Really?
597,597,They fit in the station wagon?
598,598,"That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong."
599,599,He's head of the family.
600,600,Speaks pretty good English.
601,601,"Hong, this is my partner, Martin Riggs, and Lorna."
602,602,Wife?
603,603,No.
604,604,"Rog, can l speak to you?"
605,605,"CARRlE: Lorna, this is the best breakfast."
606,606,I'm hungry. l'd love some.
607,607,Are you out of your mind? This is illegal.
608,608,"As in, ""against the law."" You'll bring a shitstorm down on you."
609,609,Just hold on!
610,610,Just wait a frigging minute!
611,611,"The way l see it, those are slave ships out there."
612,612,"And l'm freeing slaves, I'm freeing slaves..."
613,613,...like no one did for my ancestors. Okay?
614,614,"Riggs, it's my chance to do something and do it right."
615,615,Why didn't you say so?
616,616,This is not gonna be boring.
617,617,Need any help?
618,618,Okay.
619,619,Where is he?
620,620,"Hey, Daddy."
621,621,"What is it this time, food or money?"
622,622,Food and money.
623,623,Money.
624,624,I see you more than when you lived here.
625,625,We're independent now.
626,626,"Okay, okay. What's the money for?"
627,627,"Hookers, drugs Contraceptives."
628,628,Can you believe they talk to their father like this?
629,629,Better than their parole officer.
630,630,CARRlE: lt costs more to go to school now.
631,631,"Me first, me first."
632,632,I get the tuition bills.
633,633,And the grades too.
634,634,Consider this a down payment on a future asschewing.
635,635,Get out of here and go to school.
636,636,I wanna see some grades.
637,637,I see the tuition.
638,638,I want to see some grades!
639,639,I want more cluck for my buck.
640,640,NICK: Thanks for the money.
641,641,"Oh, boy."
642,642,l'm tired.
643,643,"Me, l can't win."
644,644,Boy!
645,645,Did we get a raise and nobody told me about it?
646,646,"Heh, heh. I got to get to the bank."
647,647,How can you when you're taken to the cleaners all the time?
648,648,Yeah.
649,649,"Hey, guys."
650,650,"Hey, Trish."
651,651,"Hey, babe."
652,652,Those the kids leaving?
653,653,Yes. And we're broke.
654,654,Is Lorna here?
655,655,"Yeah. She's in the kitchen, probably on her third breakfast."
656,656,I remember those days.
657,657,"Oh, Martin, l'm sorry."
658,658,l love it when you do that.
659,659,You look terrific.
660,660,Thank you.
661,661,Wait till she starts trying to raise that baby by herself.
662,662,"Daddy, l'll be fine."
663,663,Move back in and Grandpa Rog will be up all night with the baby.
664,664,Better than her marrying the wrong guy.
665,665,"Well, you know, a cop or something."
666,666,True.
667,667,"Come on, guys. See you."
668,668,l should say goodbye.
669,669,"TRlSH: Hey, Lorna."
670,670,MURTAUGH: Hurry up.
671,671,"RIGGS: Oh, yeah. Stuffing your face."
672,672,Stop kissing me. Try that.
673,673,You stay away from my girl.
674,674,I'm not joking.
675,675,Stay away from my girl.
676,676,Joking.
677,677,Bye! Got the baby beeper?
678,678,RIGGS: Yeah.
679,679,l know.
680,680,lt's your fault.
681,681,It's your fault.
682,682,All the chicken shit.
683,683,Flapping all over the place.
684,684,"All right, everybody!"
685,685,"It's been a year almost already, okay?"
686,686,This shit ain't funny no more!
687,687,All right? Enough is enough!
688,688,Please! Enough.
689,689,I'm the one that gets it in the neck. Can we exercise a little maturity around here?
690,690,"If l find who's doing this, I'll kick his ass."
691,691,What asshole is doing this?
692,692,"Riggs, l catch that asshole who put my picture up, that's it!"
693,693,That's it.
694,694,RIGGS: Cut their balls off.
695,695,Captain.
696,696,"Hey, captain."
697,697,MURPHY: I look out expecting to see all the old faces.
698,698,"Instead, l see a bunch of kids whose names I barely remember."
699,699,Will you sit down?
700,700,We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
701,701,Speak for yourself.
702,702,"We're making way for the new police: Guys with guns and psychology degrees, like Butters out there."
703,703,Biter has a psychology degree?
704,704,More like a psycho degree.
705,705,"Hell, I got nothing against it."
706,706,Times have got to change.
707,707,I once got shot by a hotrodder with a zip gun.
708,708,That's how far back I go.
709,709,You wanted to see us about something?
710,710,Some things don't change.
711,711,Here we go.
712,712,MURPHY: The department lost its insurance.
713,713,"All the damage you've done, they can't get a new one..."
714,714,...while you two guys are still running around.
715,715,They can't fire you either.
716,716,So they're promoting you.
717,717,Heh.
718,718,Eh.
719,719,Lieutenant.
720,720,MURPHY: There's no open lieutenant spots.
721,721,"So the chief used his special privilege, he's making you captains."
722,722,Better.
723,723,Captain.
724,724,Time was when this would send me over the falls. I'm getting old.
725,725,"So, what the hell we do now?"
726,726,"I don't know, captain shit."
727,727,Hang out.
728,728,MURTAUGH: Take long lunches.
729,729,"Yell, ""Riggs, Murtaugh, I'm the captain."" MURTAUGH: ""Chief's shitting bricks, man."" You finished? You finished?"
730,730,Think you can stay off the streets and out of trouble?
731,731,Absolutely.
732,732,Captain Riggs.
733,733,Captain Murtaugh.
734,734,"LAUGHlNG RIGGS: All right, hey."
735,735,"Hey, this is MURPHY: Hey."
736,736,You want your badges? Let me see those sergeant badges. Give me those.

738,738,RIGGS: Never liked it.
739,739,Here.
740,740,Give me those.
741,741,This is one of the most painful fucking experiences of my life.
742,742,Now get out of here.
743,743,"Thank you, captain."
744,744,"Thank you, captain."
745,745,"Thank you, captain."

754,754,"Play golf, tennis...."
755,755,"SINGlNG They got brown rings ALL: Around their noses Now that you're captains, come up in the chopper for a ride."
756,756,Not for me.
757,757,RIGGS: l'll take a rain check.
758,758,"lf you change your mind, call us."
759,759,He's downtoearth kind of guy.
760,760,Aw.
761,761,I'm sorry.
762,762,"Can we knock this shit off, please?"
763,763,This is your captain speaking.
764,764,"Can we knock it off, please? Okay?"
765,765,Jesus.
766,766,"The man's got feelings, you know?"
767,767,"PEOPLE LAUGHlNG BUTTERS: Hey, congratulations. Look at you."
768,768,Captain Murtaugh.
769,769,"I don't really know how to say this, but you really inspire me."
770,770,Keep it up.
771,771,"RIGGS: How's it going, Burton?"
772,772,"lt's Butters, captain."
773,773,Yeah. I'll remember that.
774,774,Kid really likes you.
775,775,l wish he'd cut that shit out.
776,776,He likes me?
777,777,Likes me?
778,778,What?
779,779,"No. You don't think he likes me, likes me, likes me..."
780,780,...likes me like that?
781,781,Oh.
782,782,"This is not the military, it's the police force."
783,783,The millennium's creeping up on us.
784,784,"The captain said, ""New people, new department."" Dr. Woods?"
785,785,WOODS: Yes.
786,786,Oh. Captain Riggs.
787,787,Don't run.
788,788,l'm in a rush.
789,789,l need to talk to you.
790,790,Do you? Ah. What is it this time?
791,791,Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
792,792,Or did you cook up something new?
793,793,l'm sorry about all that.
794,794,I wanted your advice.
795,795,I was thinking of Thinking?
796,796,Marriage.
797,797,"LAUGHS Marriage? The ""M"" word?"
798,798,"Does ""confidentiality"" mean anything to you?"
799,799,That's funny.
800,800,You know what would happen?
801,801,We'd go in my office...
802,802,...and you know what you'd tell me?
803,803,What?
804,804,"You'd tell me something like, ""Doc..."
805,805,"...l want to marry Murtaugh."" Or your mother maybe."
806,806,Or how about Nelson Mandela?
807,807,Nelson Mandela?
808,808,"Something to ridicule me, Riggs."
809,809,Something to get a rise out of me.
810,810,Listen carefully.
811,811,I'm not stupid.
812,812,And my time is reserved...
813,813,...for police officers with real needs and real problems.
814,814,Have you got that?
815,815,Have you?
816,816,Run it by me again?
817,817,No. And you know what?
818,818,I don't like you.
819,819,RIGGS: Stephanie?
820,820,I can't go out with you.
821,821,I'm in a relationship. l'm very happy.
822,822,I think you need to see someone.
823,823,You'll find someone someday who'll love you.
824,824,Not in this department.
825,825,But stop bothering me!
826,826,WOODS: You're disgusting!
827,827,What's the matter with you people?
828,828,What's shaking?
829,829,Captain Riggs.
830,830,Captain Murtaugh.
831,831,You're supposed to turn around and do that.
832,832,We're captains.
833,833,Heard you were up to your ass in Chinese.
834,834,The taller ones come up to the navel.
835,835,"They were short, but big enough to kick your ass. What can l do for you?"
836,836,"One of the ship's crew shot one of the illegals, apparently under orders..."
837,837,...and we'd dearly like to know who's smuggling Chinese these days.
838,838,"We got no hard evidence, but we're pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan."
839,839,MURTAUGH: Uncle Benny?
840,840,You know him?
841,841,RIGGS: Yeah.
842,842,Back when he was running smack.
843,843,We never nailed him either.
844,844,Benny's slippery.
845,845,Where's he hanging out these days?
846,846,"He's got a nightclub, couple restaurants."
847,847,He operates mainly out on North Broadway.
848,848,Here's the address.
849,849,"Hi, fellas."
850,850,MAN: Riggs.
851,851,There he is.
852,852,"Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers."
853,853,BUTTERS: Butters.
854,854,What you got on the freighter homicide?
855,855,I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.
856,856,They only knew the shooter by sight.
857,857,Checked out the boat.
858,858,Turns out the boat's registered under a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
859,859,"It'll be a rough one to crack, but we'll nail them."
860,860,You ever hear of Benny Chan?
861,861,Benny Chan.
862,862,No. What kind of bad man is he?
863,863,Real bad.

1994,1994,...my mother.
1995,1995,They told me that she left or something.
