801,801,"Oh, yes, ma'am."
802,802,A cold drink would be fine. Thank you.
803,803,"Mr. Hammersmith, your office said I might find you at home."

809,809,Lost a few clients your way.
810,810,I'd like to ask you about one of them.
811,811, Have a seat.
812,812, Thank you.
813,813,Which client?
814,814,Now you got my curiosity aroused.
815,815, John Coffey.
816,816, Ah.
817,817,Coffey.
818,818,He causing you problems?
819,819,No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like the dark and cries on occasion...
820,820,but other than that...
821,821,"He cries, does he?"
822,822,"Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say."
823,823,You know what he did.
824,824,I read the court transcript.
825,825," Thank you, missus."
826,826, My pleasure.

830,830,What exactly are you trying to find out?
831,831,I've wondered if he did anything like that before.
832,832,Why?
833,833,Has he said anything?
834,834,"No, but a man who does a thing like that..."
835,835,has often developed a taste for it over time. It occurred to me...
836,836,that it might be easy enough to follow his back trail. Find out.
837,837,"A man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace."
838,838,"You'd think so, but you'd be wrong."
839,839,"Believe me, we tried."
840,840,Like he'd dropped out of the sky.
841,841,How can that be?
842,842,We're in a depression.
843,843,A third of the country's out of work.
844,844,"People are drifting by the thousands, looking for jobs, for greener grass."
845,845,Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere.
846,846,Not until he kills a couple of little girls.
847,847,He is...
848,848,"strange, I admit."
849,849,But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him.
850,850,"I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith."
851,851,I deal with them day in and day out.
852,852,You didn't come to ask me whether he killed before.
853,853,You came to see if I think he did it at all.
854,854,Do you?
855,855,One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.
856,856,He was found with the victims in his arms.
857,857,And yet you defended him.
858,858,Everyone is entitled to a defense.
859,859,"<font color""804040"">MRS. HAMMERSMITH</font>: Kids!"
860,860,Lunch!
861,861,Y'all listen to your mama!
862,862,I'll tell you something.
863,863,"And you listen close too, because it might be something you need to know."
864,864,I'm listening.
865,865,We had us a dog.
866,866,Just a sweet mongrel.
867,867,You know the kind.
868,868,"Well, in many ways, a good mongrel dog is like a Negro."
869,869,You get to know it.
870,870,"Often, you get to love it."
871,871,It is of no particular use...
872,872,but you keep it around because you think it loves you.
873,873,"If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different."
874,874,My wife and I were not so lucky.
875,875,"Caleb, come here for a second."
876,876,Come here.
877,877,"Please, son."
878,878,He still has the one good eye.
879,879,I suppose he's lucky...
880,880,not to be completely blind.
881,881,We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at least.
882,882,"Right, Caleb?"
883,883,"Okay, go on in now."
884,884,That dog attacked my boy for no reason.
885,885,Just got it in his mind one day.
886,886,The same with John Coffey.
887,887,He was sorry afterwards.
888,888,Of that I have no doubt.
889,889,But those little girls...
890,890,stayed raped and murdered.
891,891,Maybe he'd never done it before.
892,892,My dog never bit before.
893,893,But I didn't concern myself with that.
894,894,"I went out with my rifle, grabbed his collar and blew his brains out."
895,895,Is Coffey guilty?
896,896,"Yes, he is."
897,897,Don't you doubt it.
898,898,And don't you turn your back on him.
899,899,You may get away with it once or even a hundred times...
900,900,but in the end...

1855,1855,But I have to know...
1856,1856,does this have anything to do with what happened at my house?
1857,1857,"Does it, Paul?"
1858,1858,No.
1859,1859,"<font color""808080"">(MAN SINGING ON RADIO)</font> <font color""808080"">(SIGHS)</font> Does Hal know?"
1860,1860,"That Coffey's innocent, I mean."
1861,1861,"Well, can he help?"
1862,1862,Does he have the influence to do something about this?
1863,1863, Stop the execution?
1864,1864, No.
1865,1865,Then don't tell him.
1866,1866,"If it can't help, don't tell him."
1867,1867,Ever.
1868,1868,I won't.
1869,1869,"There's no way out of this for you, is there?"
1870,1870,No.
1871,1871,"And I've been thinking about it, believe me."
1872,1872,I've been running it through my head any number of ways. No.
1873,1873,"I'll tell you the truth, honey."
1874,1874,I've done some things in my life that I am not proud of...
1875,1875,but this is the first time I've ever felt real danger of hell.
1876,1876,Hell?
1877,1877,"Oh, Paul."
1878,1878,Talk to him.
1879,1879,Talk to John.
1880,1880,Find out what he wants.

1882,1882,"Hello, John."
1883,1883,I guess you know we're coming down to it now.
1884,1884,Another couple of days.
1885,1885,Is there anything special you wanna eat that night?
1886,1886,We can rustle you up most anything.
1887,1887,Meat loaf be nice.
1888,1888,"Mashed taters, gravy."
1889,1889,Okra.
1890,1890,Maybe some of that fine corn bread your missus make...
1891,1891,if she don't mind.
1892,1892,Now...
1893,1893,what about a preacher?
1894,1894,Someone to say a little prayer with.
1895,1895,Don't want no preacher.
1896,1896,"You can say a prayer, if you like."
1897,1897,Me?
1898,1898,"Suppose I could, if it came to that."
1899,1899,John...
1900,1900,I have to ask you something very important now.
1901,1901,I know what you gonna say.
1902,1902,You don't have to say it.
1903,1903,"No, I do. I do. I have to say it."
1904,1904,John...
1905,1905,tell me what you want me to do.
1906,1906,You want me to take you out of here?
1907,1907,Just let you run away?
1908,1908,See how far you could get?
1909,1909,Why would you do such a foolish thing?
1910,1910,On the day of my judgment...
1911,1911,when I stand before God...
1912,1912,and he asks me why did I...
1913,1913,Did I kill one of his true...

1915,1915,what am I going to say?
1916,1916,That it was my job?
1917,1917,It's my job.
1918,1918,You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done.
1919,1919,I know you're hurting and worrying.
1920,1920,I can feel it on you.
1921,1921,But you ought to quit on it now.
1922,1922,I want it to be over and done with.
1923,1923,I do.
1924,1924,"I'm tired, boss."
1925,1925,"Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain."
1926,1926,I'm tired of never having me a buddy to be with...
1927,1927,"to tell me where we's going to, coming from, or why."
1928,1928,"Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."
1929,1929,I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world...
1930,1930,every day.
1931,1931,There's too much of it.
1932,1932,It's like pieces of glass in my head...
1933,1933,all the time.
1934,1934,Can you understand?
1935,1935,"Yes, John, I think I can."
1936,1936,"Well, there must be something we can do for you, John."
1937,1937,There must be something that you want.

1947,1947,"John, I should have this just for now."
1948,1948,I'll give it back after.
1949,1949,"You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream."
1950,1950,I dreamed about Del's mouse.
1951,1951,"Did you, John?"
1952,1952,I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to that place Boss Howell talked about.
1953,1953,That Mouseville place.
1954,1954,I dreamed there's kids.
1955,1955,And how they laughed at his tricks. My!
1956,1956,I dreamed that those two little blondheaded girls was there.
1957,1957,They's laughing too.
1958,1958,I put my arms around them and set them on my knees.
1959,1959,"And they was no blood coming out of they hair, and they's just fine."
1960,1960,We all watched Mr. Jingles roll that spool.
1961,1961,How we did laugh.
1962,1962,"Fit to bust, we was!"
1963,1963,John.
1964,1964,They's lots of folks here that hate me. Lots!
1965,1965,I can feel it.
1966,1966,It's like bees stinging me.
1967,1967,"Well, feel how we feel, then."

1981,1981,I'm sorry for what I am.

2008,2008,It's quite a story.
2009,2009,One thing I don't understand.

2030,2030,And I think a part of...

2032,2032,just leapt into my tiny friend here.
2033,2033,As for me...
2034,2034,John had to give me a part of himself...
2035,2035,"a gift, the way he saw it..."
2036,2036,so that I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done.
2037,2037,When John did that...
2038,2038,when he took my hand...
2039,2039,a part of the power that worked through him...
2040,2040,spilled into me.
2041,2041,He what?
2042,2042,He infected you with life?
2043,2043,It's as good a word as any.
2044,2044,"He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles?"

2089,2089,And I think about all of us walking our own Green Mile...
2090,2090,each in our own time.
2091,2091,But one thought more than any other...
2092,2092,keeps me awake most nights: If he could make a mouse live so long...
2093,2093,how much longer do I have?
2094,2094,We each owe a death.
