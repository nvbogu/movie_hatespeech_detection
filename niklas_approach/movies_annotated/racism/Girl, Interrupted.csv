451,451,Are we going to have a probIem?

458,458,"Phone caII, booth one."
459,459,HeIIo?
460,460,Hold on.
461,461,Susanna?
462,462,"Hi, Mom."
463,463,"Hi, honey."
464,464,Your father's on too.
465,465,He's just back from reserves.
466,466,He got stuck at Dulles.
467,467,"How are you, honey?"
468,468,"I'm fine, Dad."
469,469,"You know, sweetheart..."
470,470,"If you can't give me Ex.Lax, can I pIease have some CoIace?"
471,471,No. No more Iaxatives.
472,472,I can get her some prune juice.
473,473,Prune juice!
474,474,This is outrageous!
475,475,"She was wondering if you'd made new friends, and l said.: ""No, Mom, this isn't Camp Winnetka. "" Daisy?"
476,476,Fuck off.
477,477,I have something you want.
478,478,Come in.
479,479,You're aII packed up.
480,480,"Yeah, I'm Ieaving in a month."
481,481,My dad got me an apartment.
482,482,ReaIIy? Where?
483,483,It's near the airport.
484,484,"One bedroom, two baths, eat.in chicken."
485,485,He fixed it up reaI nice for me.
486,486,You mean eat.in kitchen.
487,487,"That's what I said, asshoIe."
488,488,So what do you have that I want?
489,489,Put it on the bed.
490,490,Put yours on the bed.
491,491,"Oh, Jesus. Get out!"
492,492,Get out!
493,493,Don't take advantage just because she's new.
494,494,Pony up some VaIium.
495,495,"Get the fuck out, or I'm caIIing VaIerie! VaIerie!"
496,496,Why don't you caII VaIerie?
497,497,"CaII VaIerie and ask her for some CoIace, Iike Susie Q's got in her hand."
498,498,Why does it stink in here?
499,499,I don't take VaIium.
500,500,I know. That's the point.
501,501,"They give them to you, and you don't take them."
502,502,Are you gonna eat that?
503,503,Checks.
504,504,"You've got visitors, Daisy."
505,505,I want some fucking CoIace.
506,506,TaIk to MeIvin tomorrow.
507,507,You know what I think?
508,508,"I think you want to poop, Daisy."
509,509,I think it's been days.
510,510,"Look, it's okay. I don't care."
511,511,I do! I do care.
512,512,"So Daddy buys you a private, and no one gets in, huh?"
513,513,You never Ieave except when VaIerie makes you go to the cafeteria...
514,514,...where you never eat.
515,515,You're a Iaxative junkie.
516,516,"I aIways thought you were Iike Janet, but here you are with this chicken."
517,517,"So what's with that, huh?"
518,518,"My dad owns a deIi, asshoIe, with a rotisserie."
519,519,"I Iike my dad's chicken. When I eat something eIse, I puke."
520,520,But why do you eat it here? Why don't you Iike to go to the cafeteria?
521,521,Which do you Iike better?
522,522,Taking a dump aIone or with VaIerie watching?
523,523,AIone.
524,524,Everyone Iikes to be aIone when it comes out.
525,525,I Iike to be aIone when it goes in.
526,526,"To me, the cafeteria's Iike being with..."
527,527,...20 girIs aII at once taking a dump.
528,528,"That is fucked up, Daisy!"
529,529,Come on.
530,530,"AII right, asshoIes."
531,531,"Fine, here."
532,532,Here.
533,533,"Lisa, don't!"
534,534,"No, pIease..."
535,535,Diosfuckingmio!
536,536,That's how Daddy knows she's eating.
537,537,"When I get five, VaIerie makes me throw them away."
538,538,"ScribbIe, scribbIe, scribbIe."
539,539,Written anything about me yet?
540,540,Don't do that.
541,541,Is Daisy reaIIy getting out?
542,542,She coughed up a big one.
543,543,How can...?
544,544,"I mean, she's insane."
545,545,"That's what ""ther.rape.me"" is aII about."
546,546,That's why fucking Freud's picture's on every shrink's waII.
547,547,"He created an industry. You Iie down, confess your secrets, and you're saved."
548,548,"The more you confess, the more they think about setting you free."
549,549,But what if you don't have a secret?
550,550,"Then you're a Iifer, Iike me."
551,551,I was changing her diaper...
552,552,...and I turned to get the powder...
553,553,"...and whiIe my back was turned, she roIIed off the bed."
554,554,She roIIed off the bed and broke her Ieg.
555,555,"The doctor put her in a body cast, but aIso strapped her down."
556,556,This has nothing...
557,557,You never toId me this.
558,558,CarI pIanned this trip to Santa Monica.
559,559,He had a commitment at RAND.
560,560,So we took her with us.
561,561,"On the back seat, strapped to this board, 4000 miIes."
562,562,"If you Iike, Mrs. Kaysen, we can discuss this..."
563,563,...further on the way out.
564,564,Just how Iong is my daughter going to be here?
565,565,"With aII due respect, Mr. Kaysen..."
566,566,...psychiatry and economics are different.
567,567,The Iength of Susanna's stay isn't fixed.
568,568,It depends on her response to treatment.
569,569,For what? Depression?
570,570,It's aImost Christmas. What do we say to the peopIe who care about her?
571,571,"See, what's going on here is..."
572,572,...my parents are having a IittIe hoIiday cocktaiI Christmas party crisis.
573,573,What?
574,574,"What's the ""borderIine"" business you mentioned?"
575,575,I don't think that's usefuI to Susanna.
576,576,"I mean, not..."
577,577,"What ""borderIine business""?"
578,578,The mind...
579,579,BorderIine what?
580,580,BorderIine between what and what?
581,581,"It's a condition, Susanna."
582,582,And it's caIIed BorderIine PersonaIity Disorder.
583,583,"Oh, God."
584,584,It's not uncommon.
585,585,EspeciaIIy among young women.
586,586,What causes it?
587,587,We're reaIIy not sure.
588,588,Is it genetic?
589,589,"Oh, Christ!"
590,590,It is five times more common...
591,591,...among those with a borderIine...
592,592,...parent.
593,593,"I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't."
594,594,I can't do this.
595,595,"""Razors pain you; rivers are damp; acid stains you; drugs cause cramp."

598,598,AsshoIe.
599,599,Fatso.
600,600,CaII me a cab.
601,601,"Okay, you're a cab."
602,602,Lisa said you got into Daisy's room.
603,603,And it was fuII of chickens.
604,604,"Susanna, you have a phone caII."
605,605,"So what's your ""diagnonsense""?"
606,606,Who is this?
607,607,What'd he say to Mom and Pop?
608,608,I have a borderIine personaIity.
609,609,"WeII, that's nothing."
610,610,What eIse?
611,611,He didn't say. He thought it wouId affect my recovery.
612,612,Tongue your meds tonight.
613,613,"After 1:00 checks, Gretta aIways goes for a smoke."
614,614,"Check the mirrors. lf they're clear, go to Hector's closet."
615,615,"lt's near the art room, and it will be open."
616,616,Torch!
617,617,Come on.
618,618,This is how Lisa gets out when she escapes!
619,619,"We're under administration, so..."
620,620,No good here.
621,621,Good thing this pIace has a sIiding scaIe.
622,622,We get to mingIe with the Iock.picking trash.
623,623,Good job!
624,624,"Susanna, you're up!"
625,625,"No, no, no. I've onIy done this once in my Iife."
626,626,Come on.
627,627,PIease.
628,628,We came aII the way here.
629,629,Come on!
630,630,AII right!
631,631,They put the tunneIs in so the Ioons didn't have to go out in the coId.
632,632,I must've missed that in the brochure.
633,633,"Hey, open the door."

775,775,That is not fair!
776,776,Seventy.four is the perfect weight!
777,777,"Good Iuck, crazy bitch."
778,778,What kind of tree can you be down there on the fIoor?
779,779,"I'm a fucking shrub, aII right?"
780,780,"Martin Luther King Jr. was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee."
781,781,He was shot as he stood on the balcony of his hotel room.
782,782,"Last night, he said this.: l don't know what will happen now."
783,783,We've got some difficult days ahead.
784,784,But it really doesn't matter with me now...
785,785,...because l've been to the mountaintop.

806,806,Taking five minutes for me wouId be a dereIiction of duty?
807,807,What if I had a punctured artery?
808,808,"You'd go on your rounds, ignoring my wounds?"
809,809,Stop it.
810,810,Stop what? Look at this.
811,811,Go ahead. Go ahead.
812,812,That's enough!
813,813,Take one step and I'II jam this in my aorta!
814,814,Stop it.
815,815,Your aorta is in your chest.
816,816,Good to know.

825,825,Wait. What are we doing?
826,826,We're going to Canada.
827,827,You're not crazy.
828,828,Okay? You don't need to be here.
829,829,"I tried to kiII myseIf, Toby."
830,830,You took some aspirin.
831,831,I took a bottIe of aspirin.
832,832,That buys you a year in this pIace?
833,833,"That's buIIshit, okay?"
834,834,They're breaking you.
835,835,Come on. AII right?
836,836,"Everything's changing, man."

859,859,Not with you.
860,860,I'm sorry.
861,861,"Susanna, wait a second."
862,862,Why did you do that?
863,863,Fix the Iight buIb at night?

870,870,That's aII.
871,871,"I wish you were getting better, though."
872,872,I wouId...
873,873,I'd take you out to go see a movie or something.
874,874,That'd be nice.
875,875,My face!

891,891,I'm ugIy! Why?
892,892,What happened to PoIIy?
893,893,What needs to happen?
894,894,No one's ever gonna kiss her.
895,895,They're buiIding a new DisneyIand in FIorida.
896,896,"If I couId have any job, I'd be a professionaI CindereIIa."
897,897,You couId be Snow White.
898,898,PoIIy couId be Minnie Mouse and then...
899,899,"...she'd be hugged, kissed and Ioved..."
900,900,...and no one wouId know what's inside that giant head.
901,901,Give me your keys.
902,902,"Hey, PoIIy."
903,903,It's Susanna.
904,904,Just pIay something.
905,905,"If taIking did shit, we'd be out of here by now."
906,906,"When you're alone And life is making you lonely You can always go Downtown When you've got worries All the noise and the hurry Seems to help, l know Downtown Just listen to the music ln the traffic in the city Linger on the sidewalks Where the neon lights are pretty How can you lose?"
907,907,"The lights are much brighter there You can forget all your troubles Forget all your cares and go downtown Back to your room, pIease."
908,908,Things will be great when you're Downtown McWiIIey is gonna wake up.
909,909,Give me the guitar.
910,910,You're gonna get me fired.
911,911,You'll be dancing with him Before the night is over Give me the guitar.
912,912,Happy again No. No.
913,913,It's okay. It's okay.
914,914,Come here.
915,915,You'II get me fired.
916,916,You know that?
917,917,Downtown Everything's great...
918,918,... when you're downtown I'm writing you up.
919,919,I am sick of this buIIshit.
920,920,Is she here?
921,921,You can go in now.
922,922,What did she do?
923,923,They drugged Nurse McWiIIey.
924,924,"Good morning, Susanna."
925,925,Good morning.
926,926,How are you?
927,927,"I'm fine, I guess."
928,928,Sit down.
929,929,You Iook tired.
930,930,"PoIIy freaked out Iast night and we stayed up singing to her, Lisa and I."
931,931,Have you become friends with Lisa?
932,932,Why? Is that bad?
933,933,Does it feeI bad?
934,934,No.
935,935,"Before you came here, did you have many girIfriends?"
936,936,Not reaIIy.
937,937,"WouId you say that before you came here, your friends consisted mainIy..."
938,938,"...of boys, of men?"
939,939,Does it say in there that I'm promiscuous?
940,940,Why do you choose that word?
941,941,How many guys wouId I have to sIeep with to be considered promiscuous?
942,942,Textbook promiscuous?
943,943,What do you think?
944,944,Ten. Eight. Five.
945,945,How many girIs wouId a guy have to sIeep with to be considered promiscuous?
946,946,Ten? 20? 109?
947,947,Someone who's compuIsiveIy promiscuous...
948,948,...might engage in a sex act with a guest in their room...
949,949,...and then engage in another sex act during the same day with an orderIy.
950,950,Am I in troubIe for kissing an orderIy or giving my boyfriend a bIowjob?
951,951,MeIvin says...
952,952,...you have some very interesting theories about your iIIness.
953,953,You beIieve there is a mysticaI undertow in Iife.
954,954,"""Quicksands of shadows."" Another one of my theories is that you peopIe don't know what you're doing."
955,955,You acknowIedge a probIem coping with this quicksand.
956,956,I have a probIem coping with this hospitaI. I wanna Ieave.
957,957,I can't do that.
958,958,"I signed myseIf in, I can sign myseIf out."
959,959,You signed yourseIf into our care.
960,960,We decide when you Ieave.
961,961,"You're not ready for it, Susanna."
962,962,Your progress has pIateaued.
963,963,Does that disappoint you?
964,964,I'm ambivaIent.
965,965,"In fact, that's my new favourite word."
966,966,"Do you know what that means, ambivaIence?"
967,967,I don't care.
968,968,"If it's your favourite word, I wouId've..."
969,969,"It means ""I don't care."" That's what it means."
970,970,"On the contrary, Susanna."
971,971,AmbivaIence suggests strong feeIings in opposition.
972,972,"The prefix, as in ambidextrous..."
973,973,"...means ""both."" The rest of it, in Latin, means ""vigour."" The word suggests that you are torn..."
974,974,...between two opposing courses of action.
975,975,WiII I stay or wiII I go?
976,976,Am I sane or am I crazy?
977,977,Those aren't courses of action.
978,978,"They can be, dear, for some."
979,979,"WeII, then, it's the wrong word."
980,980,No.
981,981,I think it's perfect.
982,982,"""What worId is this?"
983,983,What kingdom?
984,984,"What shores of what worIds?"" It's a very big question you're faced with, Susanna."
985,985,The choice of your Iife.
986,986,How much wiII you induIge in your fIaws?
987,987,What are your fIaws?
988,988,Are they fIaws?
989,989,"If you embrace them, wiII you commit yourseIf to hospitaI for Iife?"
990,990,"Big questions, big decisions."
991,991,Not surprising you profess careIessness about them.
992,992,Is that it?
993,993,For now.
994,994,"This way, Susanna."
995,995,John was moved to the men's ward.
996,996,And Lisa never came back from Dr. Wick's office.
997,997,We live in a time of doubt.
998,998,The institutions we once trusted no longer seem reliable.
999,999,Daisy sent us a postcard aII about her new apartment.
1000,1000,She got a pussycat.
1001,1001,Where's Lisa?
1002,1002,You know where she is.
1003,1003,They just put her in another ward.
1004,1004,I think you need to get up.
1005,1005,"I'm just gonna rest for a whiIe, just a IittIe whiIe."
1006,1006,What are you doing?
1007,1007,Fuck!
1008,1008,"Sorry, too coId?"
1009,1009,What the fuck are you doing?
1010,1010,Get me the fuck out of this tub!
1011,1011,Get yourseIf out.
1012,1012,Where's Lisa?
1013,1013,Where the fuck is Lisa?
1014,1014,Can't hack it without her?
1015,1015,You banish her for singing to PoIIy.
1016,1016,We were trying to heIp her!
1017,1017,We were trying to heIp her! This pIace is a fucking fascist torture chamber!
1018,1018,No.
1019,1019,I worked in state hospitaIs.
1020,1020,This pIace is a five.star hoteI.
1021,1021,"Oh, lordy, pick a bale of cotton You know, I can take a Iot of crazy shit from a Iot of crazy peopIe..."
1022,1022,...but you?
1023,1023,You are not crazy.
1024,1024,Then what's wrong with me?
1025,1025,What the fuck's going on inside my head?
1026,1026,"TeII me Dr. VaI, what's your diag.nonsense?"
1027,1027,"You are a Iazy, seIf.induIgent IittIe girI..."
1028,1028,...who is driving herseIf crazy.
1029,1029,Is that your medicaI opinion? Huh?
1030,1030,Is that what you've Iearned in your studies at night schooI...
1031,1031,...for Negro weIfare mothers?
1032,1032,"I mean, MeIvin doesn't have a cIue."
1033,1033,Wick is a psycho. And you...
1034,1034,...pretend you're a doctor.
1035,1035,"You sign charts and doIe out meds, but you's ain't no doctor, Miss VaIerie."
1036,1036,You's ain't nothing but a bIack nursemaid.
1037,1037,And you're just throwing it away.
1038,1038,You stiII wanna go to FIorida?
1039,1039,"Lisa, we need money, don't we?"
1040,1040,You've tongued your meds?
1041,1041,"Yeah, but I onIy have..."
1042,1042,They gave me shocks again.
1043,1043,"Jamie, I have to get out of here."
1044,1044,I'm Susanna.
1045,1045,I'm Susanna.
1046,1046,What are we doing?
1047,1047,What is it?
1048,1048,"""Dear sir, pIease give Daisy Randone assistance..."
1049,1049,"...instaIIing a teIephone at 23 Vicar Street."" I thought we were going to FIorida!"
1050,1050,We just need a pIace to crash tiII we get pIane tickets.
1051,1051,Come on.
1052,1052,Nice coat.
1053,1053,What?
1054,1054,"You don't want me, Tony."
1055,1055,"Yes, I do, baby."
1056,1056,"No, you don't."
1057,1057,I'm a crazy girI.
1058,1058,"You're crazy, so we can't have one night?"
1059,1059,I am a crazy girI. SeriousIy.
1060,1060,You've been in a hospitaI?
1061,1061,Yes.
1062,1062,Do you see purpIe peopIe?
1063,1063,"My friend, he saw purpIe peopIe."
1064,1064,And so the state came and took him away.
1065,1065,He didn't Iike that.
1066,1066,Some time went by...
1067,1067,...and he toId them he didn't see purpIe peopIe no more.
1068,1068,He got better.
1069,1069,No. He stiII sees them.
1070,1070,We gotta spIit.
1071,1071,Somebody stop her!

1101,1101,I wanna make pancakes.
1102,1102,I'm tired.
1103,1103,I wanna go to bed.
1104,1104,I want to make pancakes in the morning.
1105,1105,There's a market on the corner.
1106,1106,Pans are under the sink.
1107,1107,SiIver's in that drawer.

1128,1128,"I'm sick, Daisy. We know that."
1129,1129,"But here you are in so.caIIed recovery, cut up Iike a ham."
1130,1130,"Just stop it, okay?"

1144,1144,"You're just jeaIous, Lisa..."
1145,1145,...because I got better.
1146,1146,Because I was reIeased.
1147,1147,Because I have a chance.
1148,1148,And a Iife.
1149,1149,They didn't reIease you because you're better.
1150,1150,They just gave up.
1151,1151,You caII this a Iife?
1152,1152,Taking Daddy's money? Buying your doIIies and your knickknacks?
1153,1153,Eating his fucking chicken?
1154,1154,Fattening up Iike a prize heifer?
1155,1155,"You changed the scenery, but not the situation..."
1156,1156,...and the warden makes house caIIs.
1157,1157,And everybody knows.
1158,1158,Everybody knows that he fucks you.
1159,1159,What they don't know...
1160,1160,...is that you Iike it.
1161,1161,You Iike it.
1162,1162,Shut the fuck up!

1172,1172,Has she come down yet?
1173,1173,No.
1174,1174,But she's been pIaying that shit aII morning!
1175,1175,Why does my heart go on beating?
1176,1176,Why do these eyes of mine cry?
1177,1177,Don't they know lt's the end of the world lt ended when you said Goodbye Daisy?
1178,1178,"Oh, my God!"
1179,1179,What an idiot.
1180,1180,"Yes, I need an ambuIance."
1181,1181,Make it a hearse.
1182,1182,Daisy Randone. She kiIIed herseIf.
1183,1183,Yes. PIease hurry!
1184,1184,You pressed her buttons.
1185,1185,Now you're taking her money.
1186,1186,I didn't press shit.
1187,1187,She was waiting for an excuse.
1188,1188,Pack up.
1189,1189,We have to go.
1190,1190,AII right?
1191,1191,We have to go!
1192,1192,Now we have money.
1193,1193,Don't be stupid.
1194,1194,"AII right, fine."
1195,1195,Be stupid.
1196,1196,We shouId send someone for a Iitter box.
1197,1197,Can I pet the kitty?
1198,1198,Be carefuI.
1199,1199,"HeIIo, puddy.cat."
1200,1200,Kitty!
1201,1201,You are so cute.
1202,1202,Checks.
1203,1203,Where's Georgina?
1204,1204,She's staying with PoIIy tonight.
1205,1205,They're pIaying with your cat.
1206,1206,Did they find Lisa?
1207,1207,No.
1208,1208,I couIdn't stand up to her.
1209,1209,A decent person wouId have done something.
1210,1210,Shut her up.
1211,1211,Gone upstairs.
1212,1212,TaIked to Daisy.
1213,1213,MeIvin said you went upstairs.
1214,1214,Too Iate.
1215,1215,What wouId you have said to her?
1216,1216,I don't know.
1217,1217,That I was sorry.
1218,1218,That I'II never know what it was Iike to be her.
1219,1219,But I know what it's Iike to wanna die.
1220,1220,How it hurts to smiIe.
1221,1221,"How you try to fit in, but you can't."
1222,1222,How you hurt yourseIf on the outside...
1223,1223,...to try to kiII the thing on the inside.
1224,1224,"Susanna, it's aII weII and good to teII me aII this."
1225,1225,But you've got to teII some of this to your doctors.
1226,1226,How am I supposed to recover...
1227,1227,...when I don't even understand my disease?
1228,1228,But you do understand it.
1229,1229,You spoke very cIearIy about it a second ago.
1230,1230,But I think what you've got to do is put it down.
1231,1231,Put it away.
1232,1232,Put it in your notebook.
1233,1233,But get it out of yourseIf.
1234,1234,"Away, so you can't curI up with it anymore."
1235,1235,Lisa thinks it's a gift.
1236,1236,That it Iets you see the truth.
1237,1237,Lisa's been here for eight years.
1238,1238,I'm so sorry.
1239,1239,I was a pig.
1240,1240,It's aII right. Listen.
1241,1241,Do not drop anchor here.
1242,1242,Understand?
1243,1243,When you don't want to feel...
1244,1244,... death can seem like a dream.
1245,1245,But seeing death...
1246,1246,...really seeing it...
1247,1247,...makes dreaming about it fucking ridiculous.
1248,1248,"Maybe there's a moment, growing up..."
1249,1249,... when something peels back.
1250,1250,Maybe we look for secrets because we can't believe our minds.
1251,1251,"Though l missed Lisa, life was easier without her."
1252,1252,A thought is a hard thing to control.
1253,1253,All l know is that l began to feel again.
1254,1254,Crazy? Sane?
1255,1255,"Whatever l was, l knew there was only one way back to the world..."
1256,1256,...and that was to use the place...
1257,1257,... to talk.
1258,1258,So l saw the great and wonderful Dr. Wick three times a week...
1259,1259,...and l let her hear every thought in my head.
1260,1260,"Do you think maybe I have ESP or something, that I'm gifted?"
1261,1261,Perhaps.
1262,1262,You think I can be home by Thanksgiving?
1263,1263,"Nothing's happened in weeks, you know."
1264,1264,The point is controI.
1265,1265,"Yeah, and here I am, in controI, off meds..."
1266,1266,"...no headaches, sIeeping sound."
1267,1267,"Oh, will you help me?"
1268,1268,Can you help me?
1269,1269,You don't need to be helped any longer.
1270,1270,You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
1271,1271,l have?
1272,1272,Then why didn't you tell her before?
1273,1273,Because she wouldn't have believed me.
1274,1274,She had to learn it for herself.
1275,1275,"What have you learned, Dorothy?"
1276,1276,l think that it...
1277,1277,... that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em...
1278,1278,...and if l ever go looking for my heart's desire again...
1279,1279,...l won't look any further than my own back yard.
1280,1280,Because if it isn't there...
1281,1281,...l never really lost it to begin with.
1282,1282,ls that right?
1283,1283,That's all it is.
1284,1284,"Thanks, Joe."
1285,1285,Go away. Go away!
1286,1286,It's me.
1287,1287,It's been a whiIe...
1288,1288,...and I just wanted to say hey.
1289,1289,You okay?
1290,1290,FabuIous.
1291,1291,You're gonna be Iate.
1292,1292,Gretta's waiting for you.
1293,1293,I gotta go. Dr. Wick.
1294,1294,They stiII fucking with you?
1295,1295,They're...
1296,1296,"ActuaIIy, they're Ietting me out."
1297,1297,"Oh, that's great."
1298,1298,You better go.
1299,1299,"WeII, my dad got me a job, a part.time job..."
1300,1300,...at a bookstore in Harvard Square.
1301,1301,And I got an apartment with a phone so I can...
1302,1302,Stay in touch.
1303,1303,And I'II be seeing Sonia twice a week.
1304,1304,Is that your Iong.term pIan?
1305,1305,To work in retaiI?
1306,1306,My pIan? No.
1307,1307,Then what do you pIan to do?
1308,1308,I pIan to write.
1309,1309,Polly Clark.
1310,1310,Cynthia CrowIey.
1311,1311,Susanna Kaysen.
1312,1312,I don't think I need...
1313,1313,"SIeeping piIIs, darIing."
1314,1314,You want to be rested for tomorrow.
1315,1315,Last night's a Iong one.
1316,1316,Good girI. Katie Cooper.
1317,1317,Rosemary Jones.
1318,1318,Teresa McCuIIian.
1319,1319,Ruby?
1320,1320,"""If I spread my fingers out, my hand Iooked more human."
1321,1321,So I did that.
1322,1322,"But it wasn't tiring hoIding my fingers apart, so I Iet them reIax..."
1323,1323,"...and then, I turned my hand over."
1324,1324,The back wasn't much better.
1325,1325,"My veins buIged."" Shut up, I'm reading."
1326,1326,Shut up!
1327,1327,"""I can honestIy say that my memory has been transformed..."
1328,1328,"By Freud's definition, I've achieved mentaI heaIth."
1329,1329,"And my discharge sheet reads, 'recovered.' Recovered."" Don't do this!"
1330,1330,"""Whatever it was..."" ""Had I stopped arguing with my personaIity?"
1331,1331,"Recovered."" We were reading your book."
1332,1332,We're having a IittIe read.aIoud...
1333,1333,...ceIebrate the wisdom you're taking into the worId.
1334,1334,"Try to Iearn something, grow as peopIe."
1335,1335,"When you were a baby, they strapped you to a board."
1336,1336,You think Georgina doesn't wanna Ieave...
1337,1337,...and I'm criminaIIy insane.
1338,1338,What are you guys doing here?
1339,1339,"""Lisa's eyes, once so magnetic, now just Iook empty."" That is mine."
1340,1340,That is mine.
1341,1341,"""Georgina Iies onIy to peopIe who keep her here."
1342,1342,"Sometimes I think she wants to Iive in Oz forever."" How perceptive."
1343,1343,You better erase that thing.
1344,1344,"My father is the head of the CIA, and he couId have you dead in minutes!"
1345,1345,"""In this worId, Iooks are everything."
1346,1346,Sometimes I think PoIIy's sweetness and purity aren't genuine at aII...
1347,1347,"...but a desperate attempt to make it easier for us to Iook at her."" So nice of you to pass judgment on us now that you're cured."
1348,1348,"What the fuck are you doing, Lisa?"
1349,1349,"I'm pIaying the viIIain, Iike you want."
1350,1350,I give you everything you want.
1351,1351,"No, you don't."
1352,1352,You wanted your fiIe?
1353,1353,I got it!
1354,1354,"You wanted out, I got you out!"
1355,1355,"You needed money, I found you some!"
1356,1356,I toId you the truth!
1357,1357,I didn't write it in a book!
1358,1358,I toId you to your face!
1359,1359,"I toId Daisy what everybody knew and wouIdn't say, and she kiIIed herseIf."
1360,1360,I pIayed the fucking viIIain.
1361,1361,Just Iike you wanted.
1362,1362,Why wouId I want that?
1363,1363,"Because it makes you the good guy, sweet pea."
1364,1364,"You come back here, aII sweetness and Iight and sad and contrite..."
1365,1365,"...and everybody wrings their hands, congratuIating you on your bravery."
1366,1366,"MeanwhiIe, I'm bIowing guys at the bus station for money!"
1367,1367,"Stop it, Lisa. She's too..."
1368,1368,"Shut up, PoIIy!"
1369,1369,Where are you going?
1370,1370,I'm taIking to you!
1371,1371,Where are you going?
1372,1372,I'm taIking to you!
1373,1373,You don't Iike me anymore?
1374,1374,"No, I don't!"
1375,1375,Because you're free?
1376,1376,You think you're free?
1377,1377,I'm free!
1378,1378,You don't know what freedom is!
1379,1379,I'm free!
1380,1380,I can breathe! And you...
1381,1381,...you'II go choke on your average fucking mediocre Iife!
1382,1382,There are too many buttons in the worId.
1383,1383,"Too many buttons, and they're just..."
1384,1384,"There's way too many, begging to be pressed."
1385,1385,They're just begging to be pressed!
1386,1386,"You know, they're just begging to be pressed."
1387,1387,And it makes me wonder.
1388,1388,It makes me fucking wonder.
1389,1389,Why doesn't anybody ever press mine?
1390,1390,Why am I so negIected?
1391,1391,Why doesn't anybody reach in and rip out the truth...
1392,1392,...and teII me that I'm a fucking whore...
1393,1393,...and that my parents wish I were dead?
1394,1394,"Because you're dead aIready, Lisa!"
1395,1395,"No one cares if you die, Lisa..."
1396,1396,...because you're dead aIready.
1397,1397,Your heart is coId!
1398,1398,That's why you keep coming back here.
1399,1399,You're not free.
1400,1400,You need this pIace.
1401,1401,You need it to feeI aIive.
1402,1402,It's pathetic.
1403,1403,I've wasted a year of my Iife.
1404,1404,And maybe everyone out there is a Iiar.
1405,1405,And maybe the whoIe worId...
1406,1406,...is stupid and ignorant.
1407,1407,But I'd rather be in it.
1408,1408,I'd rather be fucking in it...
1409,1409,...than down here with you.
1410,1410,Don't. Don't.
1411,1411,Don't.
1412,1412,"Oh, God."
1413,1413,Did you get it?
1414,1414,I had to trade with a transvestite in the men's ward.
1415,1415,Thanks.
1416,1416,I'm not reaIIy dead.
1417,1417,I know.
1418,1418,"I'm gonna miss you, Susie Q."
1419,1419,"No, you're not."
1420,1420,You're gonna get out of here...
1421,1421,...and you're gonna come and see me.
1422,1422,"Hey, Georgina."
1423,1423,You know aII that stuff I write in my journaI...
1424,1424,...I don't know what I'm saying.
1425,1425,They're just thoughts.
1426,1426,Maybe I'm the Iiar.
1427,1427,Maybe not.
1428,1428,See you.
1429,1429,You think if I Ieft Ruby here you'd take care of her for me?
1430,1430,Let me pIay with her when I come for my therapy?
1431,1431,"Bye, Ruby."
1432,1432,Remember me when you shave your Iegs.
1433,1433,Declared healthy...
1434,1434,...and sent back into the world.
1435,1435,My final diagnosis.: A recovered borderline.
1436,1436,"What that means, l still don't know."
1437,1437,Was l ever crazy?
1438,1438,Maybe.
1439,1439,Or maybe life is.
1440,1440,I remember you.
1441,1441,Where are you going?
1442,1442,AII right.
1443,1443,Crazy isn't being broken...
1444,1444,... or swallowing a dark secret.
1445,1445,lt's you or me...
1446,1446,...amplified.
1447,1447,lf you ever told a lie...
1448,1448,...and enjoyed it.
1449,1449,lf you ever wished you could be a child forever.
1450,1450,They were not perfect...
1451,1451,...but they were my friends.
1452,1452,And by the '7 0s...
1453,1453,...most of them were out...
1454,1454,... living lives.
1455,1455,Some l've seen...
1456,1456,"...some, never again."
1457,1457,But there isn't a day my heart doesn't find them.
