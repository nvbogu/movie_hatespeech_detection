4,4,Things have been happening.

45,45,"Look at me, look at me."
46,46,Look at me.
47,47,Sheriff.
48,48,"Doctor, who's Felix Fojas?"
49,49,Doing great.
50,50,"Wow, aren't you a big girl, let's try this one."
51,51,Dr. Noles.
52,52,Oh.
53,53,This is for helping Isaac with his cataracts.
54,54,And this is for helping Ruth.
55,55,Did you help bake these treats young lady?
56,56,"Well, I have to tell ya, this is the best gift I've been given in quite some time."
57,57,Your family's in our prayers doctor.
58,58,You're a good man.
59,59,God has a heart for good men.
60,60,Thank you ma'am.
61,61,"Sampson, come back!"
62,62,Sampson!
63,63,Keep the change.
64,64,Hi.
65,65,"Stop, I'm serious!"
66,66,I have a daughter.
67,67,"Please, we can make this work."
68,68, I'm sorry.
69,69, I love you.
70,70,This is private property.
71,71,"I'm Felix Fojas, I knew Amanda."
72,72,Professor Fojas.
73,73,Look at me.
74,74,Look at me!
75,75,Do you have any idea what you did to my family?
76,76,Huh!
77,77,Dad?
78,78,You got five seconds to leave my property.
79,79,Daddy!
80,80,Call Father Olawale.
81,81,Christina!
82,82,Good morning.
83,83,Now why are you sitting alone here in the dark when the Lord has made us such a beautiful day!
84,84,"I know, I know your mother wouldn't want you sitting here alone lost in that computer."
85,85,How would you know what my mother wanted?
86,86,That hurt.
87,87,"Now blood or not, you are my daughter."
88,88,I didn't ask for your opinion.
89,89,"If you knew what it took for your Mother and I to become married and to make us a family, it's all for you!"
90,90,Mother wanted to fix me!
91,91,"She tried to fix me, not you!"
92,92,"When your mother's cancer came back, she was lost."
93,93,Get out!
94,94,Out!
95,95,I'm guessing you worked all the leads on that robbery since it's been over a week?
96,96,Not every single one.
97,97,Will you get Felix Fojas on the phone Nita?
98,98,Number should be in the Noles file.
99,99,"Professor Fojas is waiting in your office, says he wants to speak with you."
100,100,"Professor Fojas, you must be psychic."
101,101,"No, just a third eye."
102,102,"Yeah, I got a cousin with a sixth toe."
103,103,I suppose that's neither here nor there.
104,104,Coffee?
105,105,"No, thank you."
106,106,"So, my deputy said you were in California when we phoned, now I find you in my office."
107,107,Assumed you had questions.
108,108,As do I.
109,109,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
110,110,What exactly was the nature of your relationship with Amanda Noles?
111,111,We were intimately involved nine years ago.
112,112,Lovers?
113,113,"I loved her, but sadly, the feeling wasn't mutual."
114,114,"Reached out more times than I care to mention, and I didn't hear from her again until the message that I forward to your office."
115,115,Oh.
116,116,"Hi Felix, it's Amanda."
117,117,I didn't know who else to call.
118,118,"I don't feel like myself, I can't explain it."
119,119,Things have been happening.
120,120,Strange things.
121,121,I wish I'd handled things better between us.
122,122,Why do you think she called you?
123,123,I have experience with events involving the supernatural and beyond.
124,124,"Right, 'cause you got the third eye."
125,125,What do you think that she meant by strange things?
126,126,I can't be certain.
127,127,"Sheriff, can you tell me, did your investigators find any oddities in the house that night?"
128,128,Nothing.
129,129,Nothing.
130,130,But a broken mirror.
131,131,Where was it?
132,132,"Sheriff, please."
133,133,What harm can come from sharing that information?
134,134,"I'm still trying to figure this all out, Professor."
135,135,"Will you tell me, was it in Amanda's bedroom?"
136,136,The daughters.
137,137,Dad!
138,138,"Are you ill, Professor?"
139,139,I left my signing book in my car.
140,140,"Okay, did you need it today?"
141,141,"Yeah, I'm helping the speech pathologist after school."
142,142,"Okay, I'll cancel my two o'clock..."
143,143,"No, no, no, no, Riley can take me on the way to the center, it's fine."
144,144,I'd rather you not deal with that greaseball mechanic without me.
145,145,My god dad.
146,146,I saw the way her was ogling you yesterday.
147,147,"I can handle myself, okay."
148,148,I'm gonna be an adult in like three weeks.
149,149,Adult.
150,150,At 18 you're hardly an adult.
151,151,"All right, your mom might let..."
152,152,"I'll see you later, okay."
153,153,I love you.
154,154,"Ogling means leering, right?"
155,155,What's leering mean?
156,156,Ladies.
157,157,Father Weller held a Q and A on greeting at Friday's mass.
158,158,I'd expect a chat.
159,159,Right.
160,160,"Oh, and Miss Froy's really sick."
161,161,"Yeah, and her sub's an uber bitch."
162,162,"Yeah, like the sex starved nun type."
163,163,Awesome.
164,164,Sin is an infection of the soul.
165,165,Many people die from infection every day.
166,166,"In serious cases, an infected limb is amputated."
167,167,When you sin you open yourself up to evil.
168,168,This evil will start to infect your entire world and the world of those around you.
169,169,Is this offending your delicate sensibilities Miss Meyer?
170,170,It's making me wanna puke.
171,171,We should be repulsed by the wages of sin.
172,172,Sin is ugly!
173,173,It separates us from God and keeps us from fulfilling our purpose!
174,174,You must cut it out the moment it rears its head!
175,175,Or else the devil finds a foothold.
176,176,Ugh.
177,177,Go clean yourself up Miss Noles.
178,178,You have five minutes.
179,179,Sarah.
180,180,Sarah.
181,181,Sarah.
182,182,You may be disoriented Sarah.
183,183,You're in the Saint Joseph's infirmary.
184,184,Do you think you can sit up?
185,185,Yeah.
186,186,Thank you sister.
187,187,"Now sadly, physical manifestations like these can accompany the grieving process."
188,188,I'm fine Father Weller.
189,189,Handling it in my own way as I'm sure you did when your wife passed.
190,190,I needed help.
191,191,My daughter has yet to recover.
192,192,That's why I'm so concerned for you.
193,193,I think I'm okay to go back to class now.
194,194,"Your next patient's stuck in preop, and there's a Felix Fojas in the waiting area insisting that he speak with you."
195,195,Thank you.
196,196,Do I need to have the police remove you?
197,197,I'm not the threat.
198,198,What do you want?
199,199,I wanna discuss Amanda's message.
200,200,You and Sarah are in danger.
201,201,"Don't mention my daughter, you hear me?"
202,202,Dr. Noles.
203,203,"You know about me, she told you."
204,204,I came here because I believe her.
205,205,I came here to help.
206,206,Six o'clock at the Broken Barrel on Route Three.
207,207,You'll have as long as it takes me to finish a beer to say what you need to say.
208,208,"Imari, thank you for getting back to me so quick."
209,209,How soon can you get to Ohio?
210,210,He's not even here.
211,211,"Ugh, this place is gross Sarah."
212,212,You ladies should learn how to knock.
213,213,You might see something you shouldn't of.
214,214,We just need to get something from her car.
215,215,Personal effects are over there.
216,216,I'll play around with the rear end later.
217,217,"Swap out them gears, have her purring by morning."
218,218,What was that?
219,219,"Nothing, are you jealous?"
220,220,Wonderful job Lucy!
221,221,Let's give her a hand.
222,222,"Woo, good job!"
223,223,"One word, we're here to improve our sign language skills and help each other sign one word, just like Lucy."
224,224,It doesn't matter where your comfort level lies.
225,225,"All right, now it's time to break off into groups."
226,226,"All right, let's come over here."
227,227,You won't even try?
228,228,What are they doing in there?
229,229,Who are what?
230,230,I don't understand what that means.
231,231,Violent.
232,232,You speak so well.
233,233,"No, it's her, it's her!"
234,234, Hey!
235,235, Don't touch me!
236,236, That's her! That's her!
237,237, All right!
238,238,Don't touch me!
239,239,That's her!
240,240,That's her! That's her!
241,241,Hey J.
242,242,Thank you for coming.
243,243,Talk.
244,244,Mandy mentioned that...
245,245,Don't you say her name like you knew her.
246,246,Like you were close.
247,247,It was a mistake.
248,248,That's what she called it.
249,249,She said strange things were happening.
250,250,Do you know what she was talking about?
251,251,I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told Sheriff Garland.
252,252,"Mandy had just got home from a work trip, she called my daughter, said there was an intruder in the house."
253,253,And the police didn't find any physical evidence of an intruder?
254,254,Signs of forced entry?
255,255,What about your daughter?
256,256,Is she acting differently or out of character?
257,257,I keep thinking you're gonna have some sort of sense of propriety.
258,258,"I know that this is upsetting, but it's  You can't see it, can you!"
259,259,"You come to my home again, my work, or you go anywhere near my daughter, and I'll kill you with my bare fucking hands!"
260,260,Starting shit in here?
261,261,That was not my intention.
262,262,Not the fuck in here Frank!
263,263,Shut the fuck up Jen!
264,264,Hi dad.
265,265,Hello.
266,266,I believe I got your favorite.
267,267,"Wait, wait, wait!"
268,268,Are we forgetting something?
269,269,Bless us oh Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive.
270,270,Amen!
271,271,Let's eat.
272,272,Who was that man this morning?
273,273,Nobody.
274,274,What'd he want?
275,275,What do all men want?
276,276,Things they can't have.
277,277,Mom wanted what she couldn't have and she still had it.
278,278,What's that supposed to mean?
279,279,"You talk cryptic, I'll talk cryptic."
280,280,What's wrong with you Sarah?
281,281,What's wrong with you Thane?
282,282,You're the one that can't admit that she was a whore.
283,283,"Hey, watch your tongue!"
284,284,You're so fucking weak.
285,285,Hey!
286,286,Hey!
287,287,Have you lost your mind!
288,288,Hey!
289,289,Hey!
290,290,Get down here!
291,291,"Sarah, open up this door right now!"
292,292,Open it up or I will open it for you young lady!
293,293,Sarah!
294,294,Isn't it past your bedtime?
295,295,Don't you start nothing you can't finish.
296,296,"Oh, careful!"
297,297,My wife's upstairs.
298,298,Sheriff.
299,299,"Get up, come on."
300,300,There you go.
301,301,Who did this to ya?
302,302,Does it matter?
303,303,"Hell yeah it matters, now I gotta lock their asses up."
304,304,Am I under arrest?
305,305,"Let's just say, you're my guest until I get you to urgent care."
306,306,Go for ride one.
307,307,They need you over at that Moffett's place Roy.
308,308,Clyde's there and says it's real bad.
309,309,I'm en route.
310,310,Remain in the vehicle.
311,311,Oh my God!
312,312, Oh my fucking God!
313,313, Ma'am!
314,314, What happened!
315,315, Ma'am!
316,316,Who did this!
317,317,What are you gonna do about it?
318,318,What is happening!
319,319,Fucking find out!
320,320,"Ma'am, off the premises!"
321,321,"Mullins, get her out of here!"
322,322,We need every deputy up now.
323,323,"I need every deputy awake, out here, we need to shut down the perimeter."
324,324,We've gotta make sure that...
325,325,"Hey, I told you to stay in the vehicle!"
326,326,But this is witchcraft.
327,327,"Call Mount Vernon PD, get forensics out here."
328,328,You get back in the car.
329,329,You get back in the car now!
330,330,Before I charge you with disobeying a police order!
331,331,Oh my God.
332,332,Oh my God.
333,333,Sarah!
334,334,Baby!
335,335,Hey!
336,336,Stop!
337,337,Sarah! Sarah!
338,338,I am talking to you!
339,339,Hey!
340,340, Sarah!
341,341, What?
342,342,Where the hell have you been?
343,343,What are you talking about?
344,344,"What do you mean, what am I talking about?"
345,345,Look at you!
346,346,Look at you!
347,347,You're soaking wet and covered in mud!
348,348,Where the hell have you been?
349,349,I was having a nightmare.
350,350,"You weren't sleeping darling, okay."
351,351,I just saw you walk into this house half naked!
352,352,I don't know what you're talking about.
353,353, Where the hell were you!
354,354," Hey, hey, hey!"
355,355,I was sleeping!
356,356,Don't you leave this room!
357,357,"Sorry Sheriff, Sarah's fine."
358,358,I apologize for wasting your time.
359,359,"Nita said that you were panicked, you were driving all around town looking for her."
360,360,"Yeah, I was, but it was my mistake."
361,361,I should've called letting you people know.
362,362,I've just been having a hard time.
363,363,I understand.
364,364,Who's in the car?
365,365,Well some fruit loop from California got himself assaulted at the Barrel.
366,366,Has he received medical attention?
367,367,Taking him there now.
368,368,"Bring him inside, I'll take a look."
369,369,"You seem to have the same effect on everyone, huh?"
370,370,Must be my personality.
371,371,"Yeah, well, nothing's broken."
372,372,You all right Sheriff?
373,373,"Yeah, I gotta get back over to Ed Moffett's place."
374,374,Ed Moffett?
375,375,He fixes our cars.
376,376,Not anymore.
377,377,We got a deputy coming to pick you up any minute.
378,378,Are we okay here?
379,379,Yeah.
380,380,Okay.
381,381,"Hey, I want you to think on the men that assaulted you."
382,382,Give me some descriptions.
383,383,You ain't gonna be sleeping well tonight.
384,384,They shouldn't either!
385,385,I had no idea those idiots would do that to your face.
386,386,Yet here we are.
387,387,Where are we exactly?
388,388,Someone is attacking your family using witchcraft.
389,389,And I came here to do something about that.
390,390,You have any evidence supporting that claim?
391,391,Nothing that a man of science would accept.
392,392,But Amanda knew something was happening  I heard the message.
393,393,"Well then, you know that I'm the last person she wanted to call."
394,394,I can admit that.
395,395,"Okay, you seem  There was fear in her voice!"
396,396,You seem to be under the assumption that I believe in witchcraft.
397,397,"But you can't tell me what, if anything is happening here!"
398,398,You can't tell me what Mandy was concerned about!
399,399,"So tell me Felix, where does that leave us?"
400,400,Your ride's here.
401,401,"It's better this way, Sarah."
402,402,Yeah!
403,403,This is the day that the Lord has made!
404,404,Rejoice and be glad.
405,405,And get dressed.
406,406,I hope you brought coffee.
407,407,Well good morning!
408,408,"Hurry along, don't be late now!"
409,409,Father Weller.
410,410,Poor animal was suffering from separation anxiety.
411,411,He simply adored my wife.
412,412,I only bring him on campus now when my daughter's at the clinic.
413,413,Sit.
414,414,I'm a little concerned with Sarah.
415,415,How can I help?
416,416,She been acting different in school?
417,417,"No, nothing that I've been made aware of, but I can certainly look into it for you."
418,418,I'd appreciate that.
419,419,Of course.
420,420,Good morning.
421,421,"Doctor, have you spoken to anyone about your grief?"
422,422,How can we possibly help our children if we can't help ourselves?
423,423,I understand what you're going through.
424,424,Believe me.
425,425,Run? Let's run!
426,426,Here we go Sampson!
427,427,This property has been cursed.
428,428,"Initially I thought it was a haunting, but I've been inside the home."
429,429,There must be something to find on the grounds.
430,430,You said the family's not involved.
431,431,Can we ever be certain of anything?
432,432,Yes.
433,433,Of a great many things.
434,434,"For one, the family's not home."
435,435,We'll return when they're present.
436,436,Felix.
437,437,Felix!
438,438,"You knew they would be away, didn't you?"
439,439,"I expected it, but I didn't know."
440,440,"See, that is exactly why your vows were doomed Felix."
441,441,You know why my vows were doomed Imari.
442,442,I know we're trespassing because you blur the lines between right and wrong when it suits your whim.
443,443,I am doing what is right.
444,444,"By breaking the law, you cannot choose what rules to follow when you follow God, Felix."
445,445,God will not let me be tempted beyond what I can bare.
446,446,But when I am tempted he will provide for me a pathway to salvation?
447,447,Where is my path Imari?
448,448,"I'm not gonna have the same conversation with you again, and again, and again, and again!"
449,449,And I will not trespass!
450,450,That's noble of you Imari.
451,451,But absolutely no value to this girl under attack by spiritual forces!
452,452,This is not about the girl!
453,453,This is about you always knowing what's best for everyone!
454,454,"Now God knows what's best for me, and requires my absolute obedience."
455,455,And that I give with joy.
456,456,Her name is Sarah.
457,457,And you can wait in the car.
458,458,Did you think I loved you?
459,459,I needed you.
460,460,You should've answered my call.
461,461,You should've been there.
462,462,Sarah's in danger.
463,463,She's after Sarah.
464,464,Help me! Help!
465,465,Help me!
466,466,Help!
467,467,Help!
468,468,Help!
469,469," No, no!"
470,470, Felix! Felix!
471,471," No, no, no!"
472,472, Felix! Felix!
473,473,You're okay.
474,474,"Look, look."
475,475,Call the Sheriff.
476,476,Now.
477,477,I can't be certain we're in the same section of the woods.
478,478,Tell Gage to finish up and meet us back at the station!
479,479,"No Sheriff, it's here, I'm not lying."
480,480,These woods are vast.
481,481,Hey.
482,482,"I'm gonna do the best thing that I can do for you right now sir, I'm gonna drive you back to your hotel, I'm gonna help you personally pack your things."
483,483,Sheriff...
484,484,"If I don't, you're gonna have a real problem with me."
485,485,Sheriff!
486,486,This one's different.
487,487,How?
488,488,"Don't touch it, it's weather aged."
489,489,Whoever did this tried it once and didn't see the desired results so they tried it again and we caught them in the act today.
490,490,Someone has cast a spell on this girl.
491,491,"All right, all right, let's just slow down."
492,492,You guys can explain to me  Sheriff!
493,493,Gage found a phone.
494,494,"In the creek bed, by the clothes line."
495,495,Have Nita give me the name and address on every number in that call log.
496,496,Make sure the Father gets back to wherever he's going safely.
497,497,You're with me.
498,498,I'll call you.
499,499,I went to high school with Jillian Bartell.
500,500,"She's a good Christian, should be able to track the phone to a name and address."
501,501,Unless you start on about your third eye and piss her off.
502,502,"Sheriff, the coroner would like to talk to you about Moffett's death."
503,503,"Yeah, Mullins handling it for me, will ya?"
504,504,Copy that.
505,505,"Where's your mask, Caleb?"
506,506,"Sir, sir, are you okay?"
507,507,Do not move!
508,508,"Code 6C, Sheriff requires backup!"
509,509,Are you okay?
510,510,Calm down now Caleb!
511,511,Nothing we can't still workout!
512,512,God damn it.
513,513,There's something I need you to hear.
514,514,"Knox County 911, what's your emergency?"
515,515,Are you there?
516,516,Rewind that.
517,517,"Knox County 911, what's your emergency?"
518,518,Are you there?
519,519,"Now I'm no audiologist, but that doesn't sound like our janitor."
520,520, No.
521,521," Or, Any human being I've ever heard in my life, let alone Amanda Noles."
522,522,Agreed.
523,523,We can agree though that there's no boogeyman out there.
524,524,We're dealing with flesh and blood here.
525,525,For now.
526,526,"You're a confounding individual Professor, that's not the answer I was looking for."
527,527,"Sheriff, they need you!"
528,528,We got his address.
529,529,Sheriff.
530,530,"Ma'am, could we talk inside?"
531,531,We can talk here on the porch.
532,532,"There's been an incident, with Caleb."
533,533,"Yeah, I'm sorry ma'am."
534,534,You'd like to think that they're wrong about your kids.
535,535,But you know what you see.
536,536,I'd like to take a look in his room.
537,537,But he ain't been in there for months.
538,538,Spends most of his time in the tree house that him and his daddy built.
539,539,Over there at the end of the property.
540,540,Christina!
541,541,Sampson?
542,542,"Christina, what have you done?"
543,543,Bring me the innocent one.
544,544,Let their blood feed my roots.
545,545,And I will reward you.
546,546,Sampson.
547,547,Christina!
548,548,Sampson!
549,549,Christina!
550,550,Christina!
551,551,"No, no, no, no!"
552,552,"No, Sampson!"
553,553,Look at you!
554,554,"Hey sweetie, you look beautiful."
555,555,"I want you to meet someone, follow me."
556,556,Hey!
557,557,Hey! Sarah!
558,558,Sarah!
559,559,Hey!
560,560,You can go back anytime.
561,561,Who'd protect you then?
562,562,You're not gonna get any out here.
563,563,Radio works though.
564,564,Up to 30 miles.
565,565,Good.
566,566,Sarah!
567,567,Sarah!
568,568,Sarah!
569,569,Oh my God!
570,570,"No baby, no!"
571,571,No Sarah!
572,572,Baby.
573,573,"My God, Sarah, Sarah!"
574,574,"Baby, baby, come on."
575,575,How the hell does he get in here?
576,576,"All right, help me here."
577,577,Maybe I should go.
578,578,"No, you stay here."
579,579,Anything?
580,580,I got a beetle.
581,581,It's tied to a nail in the floor with human hair.
582,582,That's a binding spell.
583,583,They were probably using it on Caleb.
584,584,Don't touch it.
585,585,Identify yourself!
586,586,Sheriff!
587,587,"Identify yourself, slowly remove your hood or I will do it for you."
588,588,Sheriff!
589,589,"We need to go, now!"
590,590,Sheriff!
591,591,Sheriff! Sheriff!
592,592,Shit!
593,593,What happened to me?
594,594,You've been cursed.
595,595,"Come on, we need to get you back to the stream."
596,596,We need to get living water into your system or you're gonna die!
597,597,Come on!
598,598,It can't be much further.
599,599,You can't carry me.
600,600,Go!
601,601,I'll be right back.
602,602,Go.
603,603,Go.
604,604,"Oh shit, oh shit."
605,605,"Sheriff, do you copy?"
606,606,You're a day late and a dollar short Mullins.
607,607,"I'm in the back of the Crowley property, we're about half mile from State Route 73."
608,608,Oh shit.
609,609,Oh shit.
610,610,"You're gonna be okay, just keep pressure on it."
611,611,Why do all of this?
612,612,"To hear again, like you."
613,613,Like with my mother.
614,614,But why Sarah?
615,615,Why hurt her mother?
616,616,Why would she think we hurt her mother?
617,617,Dad?
618,618,Dad!
619,619,Daddy!
620,620,Help daddy!
621,621,Help daddy!
622,622,Your father will be fine ladies.
623,623,God is watching over him now.
624,624,Thank you Father.
625,625,Excuse me.
626,626,I loathe that expression on your face.
627,627,"If I'd just answered that call  Do not wrestle with the past, Felix."
628,628,It will win.
629,629,It already has.
630,630,Thank you Imari.
631,631,For everything.
632,632,The autopsy report is on the Sheriff's nightstand.
633,633,We'll be needing fresh waters.
634,634,Jesus!
635,635, Christ!
636,636, I didn't mean to Startle you.
637,637,I read Amanda's autopsy report.
638,638,"If someone had let me know she was found in the woods and stopped breathing, I would've known what we were dealing with from the beginning."
639,639,This syndrome is demonic in nature.
640,640," It wasn't the witches,  I don't..."
641,641,They were just a toy for this demon.
642,642,I don't understand.
643,643,Amanda's company was drilling wells in the Philippines and clearing trees.
644,644,When these trees are cut down vengeful spirits can be released.
645,645,Batibat.
646,646,"Once it's released it enters a human host, and finds a new wooden home."
647,647,And I believe that that demon followed Amanda back from the Philippines.
648,648,"Sheriff, if we don't act quickly, her body could become the permanent home for this vengeful, angry spirit."
649,649,It's time to take the pigs out of your parlor.
650,650,It knows we're here.
651,651,Imagine how you would feel if someone came into your home and tried to rip you out of it.
652,652,That is what we're going to do with this Batibat.
653,653,And it shall leave as instructed!
654,654,Father Imari Josiah Olawale.
655,655,Thane Noles.
656,656,"Are you prepared to give yourself to God, the Almighty tonight, Thane Noles?"
657,657,We need fresh water.
658,658,Not from the property.
659,659,She said that she loved you.
660,660,And that you loved her.
661,661,I did.
662,662,We start at dawn.
663,663,"Imari, it's unwise to proceed without a woman present."
664,664,We need a woman of God.
665,665,"Someone God loving, God fearing."
666,666,Someone who cares for him.
667,667,And we're going to need a vessel for this spirit.
668,668,Something isolated.
669,669,Where it will remain undisturbed.
670,670,It is time.
671,671,Do not be alarmed when you see your daughter.
672,672,She may or may not resemble her former self.
673,673,"But rest assured, she is present."
674,674,Christ hears God the Father in heaven.
675,675,"God the Son, redeemer of man, have mercy on us."
676,676,"Oh my God, Sarah."
677,677,Deliver us from your wrath.
678,678,From sudden and unprovided death.
679,679,From the snares of the devil.
680,680,What is she saying?
681,681,Lies.
682,682,Stand firm.
683,683,Get him out of here!
684,684,Remove him!
685,685,"I'm fine, I'm fine, help my daughter!"
686,686,"If it gets worse, leave!"
687,687,Fill your servant with courage to fight against that reprobate dragon!
688,688,"Let your mighty hand cast this demon out of your servant Sarah, so it may no longer hold captive this person whom pleased you to make in your own image and to redeem through Christ Jesus who lives and reigns with you forever!"
689,689,It wants a new host.
690,690,The Lord is willing to negotiate.
691,691,I am not!
692,692,You'll occupy no more of God's children!
693,693, Get her off the property!
694,694, You can't be in here alone.
695,695,Now!
696,696,Get her off the property or her sight will be lost!
697,697,Imari!
698,698,Imari!
699,699,"I command you, unclean spirit, by the resurrection and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ."
700,700,By the descent of the Holy Spirit and the coming of the Lord for judgment and a day and hour of your departure!
701,701,I command you moreover to obey me by the letter!
702,702,I am a minister of God!
703,703,Don't let her take Sarah.
704,704,Imari.
705,705,The stain was on the mother.
706,706,And your lust of this flesh betrays you.
707,707,Do not think of despising my command because you know me to be a great sinner.
708,708,For it is God himself who commands you.
709,709,"You shall not be emboldened to inhabit this creature of God any longer, and I cast you out in the name of Lord Jesus Christ!"
710,710,You can have me now.
711,711,I am yours.
712,712,If you allow me to stay.
713,713,Make no resistance nor delay in quitting this woman.
714,714,For it has pleased Christ to dwell in Sarah Noles.
715,715,And you are no longer welcomed.
716,716,"I command you to return to the designated vessel I have prepared, for it is he who cleans you."
717,717,He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven.
718,718,"He who once stilled the sea, and the wind and the storm."
719,719,"Harken therefore, and tremble in fear."
720,720,And may the trembling that affects this human prey.
721,721,"The fear that afflicts this image of God, descend on you foul creature now!"
722,722,"I got you, I got you, I got you."
723,723,"You're okay, you're okay."
724,724,I got you.
725,725, Sarah!
726,726, Dad!
727,727,You're okay baby.
728,728,"Oh, and you?"
729,729,You're okay.
730,730,So the family is safe?
731,731,They are.
732,732,And you?
733,733,Awakened.
734,734,A calling?
735,735,A warning.
736,736,To stay vigilant.
737,737,The darkness is getting closer.
738,738,I can see it.
739,739,Which is why he chose you to help others find the light.
