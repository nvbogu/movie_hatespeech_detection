0,0,there was a witch who lived at the border of our world and the world of the dead.
1,1,"She used to abduct children by sending her faithful servants the Navs merciless halfbirds, halfhumans."
2,2,The Navs lured the children to the witch's den where she devoured their souls.
3,3,Parents forgot their children as if they had never existed.
4,4,But one boy with a pure and bright soul managed to defeat a witch and imprison her in the world of the dead.
5,5,"However, the witch didn't give up."
6,6,She began to look for someone who would help her get back.
7,7,"Someone whose pure soul would become darker than night, who can cross the borders of the worlds."
8,8,Someone who has already been dead once.
9,9,"Time passed, and the memories of that witch remained only in fairy tales."
10,10,People call her...
11,11," Egor, why are you so late?"
12,12,Is everything okay?
13,13," Mom, let's go home."
14,14," You've grown up so fast, baby."
15,15,Remember how we used to play?
16,16,I need your help.
17,17,This is very important.
18,18,You'll help me return.
19,19, Return from where?
20,20,"Mom, you are..."
21,21," You mean, I'm dead?"
22,22," Egor, you've been screaming."
23,23,Was it another nightmare?
24,24, Has anybody taught you to knock?
25,25, What nonsense do you read before bed?
26,26,That's why you have nightmares.
27,27," Hey, don't touch it!"
28,28," Baby, I don't like moving houses either."
29,29," Julia, I'm not a baby."
30,30, Do you think I don't know what it's like to be a new kid?
31,31,"New school, new friends..."
32,32, You have to go.
33,33,Your daughter is awake.
34,34, Come here.
35,35,Here. Put it over there.
36,36, Okay.
37,37," Just put it so it doesn't catch the eye, okay?"
38,38, Are you hiring a nanny?
39,39, Yes.
40,40, But you didn't want to.
41,41, Sometimes you have to concede.
42,42,We'll keep an eye on the nanny.
43,43, Why does she need a nanny if she doesn't work?
44,44, You're not mature enough to criticize your mother.
45,45, She's not my mother.
46,46, Sit down and have breakfast.
47,47,I've made it for you.
48,48, I'll eat at school.
49,49, What's wrong again?
50,50, Transitional age.
51,51, Don't you think it's been a while?
52,52, Ouch!
53,53, What happened?
54,54, I've got electrocuted.
55,55,What kind of morning is this?
56,56,"Great, now it's not working."
57,57," Alexey, I can't take it anymore."
58,58,I can't handle it.
59,59, We've always managed.
60,60,We'll make it this time too.
61,61," Eva, what time is the music lesson today?"
62,62, Your music tutor will be waiting for you at 8 pm.
63,63," Thank you, Eva."
64,64," Hey, what are you muttering?"
65,65, Where are you going?
66,66,He asked you a question.
67,67, Is it beneath you to speak to normal people?
68,68, By normal you mean yourself?
69,69,Give me the phone.
70,70, Ask politely.
71,71,Maybe I will.
72,72,"Are you out of your mind, freak?"
73,73,What are you staring at?
74,74,Give it to me!
75,75, He's retarded!
76,76, Don't be stupid.
77,77, Give him the phone.
78,78, Here you are.
79,79, I could have handled this.
80,80, Where have you sprung from?
81,81," Here, punish yourself."
82,82, You're so in trouble!
83,83, Have you pissed yourself?
84,84," Run to your mother, sissy."
85,85," Get up, coward!"
86,86, Get off him.
87,87," Hey, break it up!"
88,88," Let's get out of here, guys!"
89,89," See you soon, freaks."
90,90, Hey! Wait up.
91,91,Hi.
92,92, You didn't have to.
93,93, Neighbours should help each other.
94,94,Wow!
95,95,Is it really yours?
96,96, It is.
97,97, Then why didn't you use it?
98,98, Because you got in the way.
99,99, Wait!
100,100,What is your name?
101,101, Some people call me Dashka.
102,102, And others?
103,103, Daniya!
104,104, I thought we had an agreement no boyfriends.
105,105,Now go home.
106,106," Yes, mom."
107,107," By the way, my name is Egor."
108,108,Daniya...
109,109, She can fall down the armchair.
110,110,It's not a good idea to put her there on her own.
111,111, I didn't put her there.
112,112," Egor, why did you put her there?"
113,113,Have you got nothing better to do?
114,114, She was there when I came in.
115,115, That's enough.
116,116,Have you already introduced yourselves?
117,117,This is our nanny Tatiana.
118,118,She's going to look after Varya.
119,119,"And you too, while she's at it."
120,120," Well, I don't need looking after."
121,121," Egor, don't be rude."
122,122,He'll get used to me being around.
123,123,"Hush, hush..."
124,124,I always find a way to get through to kids.
125,125,Always.
126,126,Didn't your mother tell you it's rude to spy on people?
127,127, She's not my mother.
128,128, You think you're special?
129,129,You think you sense things that other people don't?
130,130,You'll grow out of it.
131,131,"If you ever grow up, that is..."
132,132,Anyone home?
133,133, Hello.
134,134, Hello.
135,135, Umm... Where's Julia?
136,136, She's with the little one while I'm doing some cleaning.
137,137, Is everything alright?
138,138, Everything's wonderful.
139,139," I'm sorry, we never really had a nanny before."
140,140," There's a first time for everything, Alexey."
141,141, What's up?
142,142,How is school?
143,143,Have you made any friends?
144,144, Yeah.
145,145, Yeah? What's with the face?
146,146, I fell down.
147,147, Fell down?
148,148,Real men mustn't fall down.
149,149,Real men must stand on their own two feet.
150,150," Dad, it's a clichÃ©."
151,151, Real men must protect those who are dear to them.
152,152, What about you? Do you protect those who are dear to you?
153,153, Of course.
154,154, But a brazenfaced nanny in our house seems normal to you?
155,155," Let me decide myself what is normal in my house, okay?"
156,156, Fine!
157,157," Come back here, we're not finished."
158,158,Egor!
159,159,Cut it! Do you hear me?
160,160,"When your mother died, I almost lost my mind."
161,161,But you survived.
162,162,"So stop whining, okay?"
163,163, Egor! Egor!
164,164,"Hey man, give the ball back."
165,165,Let's go.
166,166, Ouch!
167,167, I swear I saw her!
168,168, Let me show you again.
169,169,"Here, look."
170,170,There's nothing in there.
171,171, That's because you watch a lot of basketball before bed.
172,172,Add this to his anxiety.
173,173," You, on the other hand, have no worries."
174,174, Stop it!
175,175, Mom would believe me.
176,176," Julia, can you give us a moment, please?"
177,177,"Egor, listen. I'm sick and tired of your drama."
178,178,"I get it, but mother is dead."
179,179,It's time to forget about it.
180,180, Forget?
181,181,"Protect those who are dear to you, or forget?"
182,182,"It's easier to forget, that's true."
183,183,As if she's never existed.
184,184, Fine.
185,185,"If we can't settle this as friends, we'll do it the hard way."
186,186, What the hell is wrong with you?
187,187,Who's going to pay for the damaged goods? Me?
188,188,I've been paying for you my whole life.
189,189,You get money from state.
190,190, What?
191,191,They pay me nothing!
192,192,Nobody needs you.
193,193,Neither the state nor your mother.
194,194,I'm the one suffering.
195,195,"Yeah, right."
196,196,You suffered a lot...
197,197,That's for unloading.
198,198,You haven't earned it yet.
199,199,Now run to your moron friends.
200,200,Don't come home before 10.
201,201,I'll be having guests.
202,202," This is my salary, bitch."
203,203,What are you staring at?
204,204,You're not in a circus.
205,205,We have some business to do.
206,206,"According to Wikipedia, Claude Debussy is a French composer, a leading representative of..."
207,207, Did you know that being online for a long time makes you lose touch with the real world.
208,208, What?
209,209,Bad try.
210,210, Hold on!
211,211,Why are you always running somewhere?
212,212," I'm not running, I'm walking."
213,213, Why are you serious?
214,214,"If you become friendlier, maybe you'll have some friends."
215,215, You'll also have some if you learn to make good jokes.
216,216,Now run.
217,217, Hey! Come here now!
218,218, Hurry!
219,219, Stop! Freeze!
220,220, There they are!
221,221,They went that way!
222,222, Stop! I'll get you!
223,223,"Guys, help me!"
224,224, Wow... What's this place?
225,225, I don't know.
226,226," Come, quick!"
227,227, Children aren't allowed in the forest.
228,228,"If I see you again, I'll tear your head off."
229,229, Have you shat your pants and took off?
230,230, Mother told me he's an artifact hunter.
231,231,He looks for WWII weapons in the forest.
232,232,He also killed his wife.
233,233,It's better not to mess with him.
234,234," Weapons, huh?"
235,235, What is this?
236,236, It looks like a furnace.
237,237,My grandma used to say these were used for burning people...
238,238,...alive.
239,239,She also said that after their death their souls stayed somewhere near.
240,240,Sometimes they can quietly call you by your name.
241,241,"But if you turn around, they'll take your face away."
242,242,"Egor, help me get out of here."
243,243, Did you hear it?
244,244, No.
245,245, Boo! Got you.
246,246,I'm just kidding.
247,247,Varya? Varya?
248,248, Hey!
249,249, I guess it's echo.
250,250, Echo!
251,251, See? There's nothing in there.
252,252,What is there?
253,253, We should get home.
254,254,The subscriber is currently not reachable. Please try again later.
255,255, Dad? Julia?
256,256, Maybe your camera's acting up.
257,257, Maybe.
258,258,This has already happened once.
259,259, She's so tiny.
260,260, That's weird.
261,261,Shall I stay and wait here with you?
262,262,Your lesson with a music tutor starts in 10 minutes.
263,263," That's okay, I'll be fine."
264,264,Thank you.
265,265, Varya's gone missing.
266,266,And all her stuff is gone.
267,267,Who's gone where?
268,268,Sit down and have breakfast.
269,269," Egor, we still haven't brought all the stuff from the old apartment."
270,270,Sit. What's the matter?
271,271, Your daughter has gone missing. She took her.
272,272, This isn't funny anymore.
273,273,Sit down and chill out.
274,274," Egor, what are you doing?"
275,275," Here, look!"
276,276, Wow. Right.
277,277, Egor...
278,278," What? We have to do something, you idiots!"
279,279, Calm down.
280,280, You've forgotten her just like you forgot my mom!
281,281," Alexey! Alexey, don't!"
282,282, Come over here.
283,283, Let me go! Leave me alone!
284,284," Stop! Alexey, what are you doing?"
285,285,Stop it!
286,286, Stay out of it!
287,287, Enough!
288,288, Stay here and think for a while.
289,289,"If you do this again, I'll throw you out of this house."
290,290,"Hey, can we talk?"
291,291,I need your help.
292,292,I'll meet you on the playground in 20 minutes.
293,293, Where do you think you're going?
294,294, I'll be back soon.
295,295, Are you meeting that boy?
296,296, He's nice.
297,297, One girl once ran away with a nice boy.
298,298,He kept on telling her how beautiful she was.
299,299,"But in the end, the girl was left with a daughter and an old piano that nobody wants."
300,300,Beauty is dangerous.
301,301,Never trust men.
302,302, Mom...
303,303, Am I paying the tutor for nothing?
304,304,Get to your exercises.
305,305, I hope I wasn't too hard on him?
306,306, You did everything right.
307,307,Kids should know their place.
308,308,He's a smart kid. Why would he dream up an imaginary sister?
309,309, I don't know. Maybe he wants a little sister?
310,310," Not now, Alexey."
311,311,Were you serious when you said you would throw him out?
312,312," Keep out of it, okay?"
313,313,Kids should know their place.
314,314," I can't play anymore, I'm tired."
315,315, Don't let me down.
316,316,You'll get there soon.
317,317,Mom?
318,318,"If you dare open it, you'll seriously regret this."
319,319,Dasha! Dasha!
320,320,"Dasha, wait! Dasha!"
321,321,What's the matter?
322,322,"Dasha! Wait, please."
323,323, She'll come back. She'll come back.
324,324, Wake up! Wake up!
325,325, She'll come back!
326,326," Dasha, wake up!"
327,327,Daniya!
328,328, Egor? What has happened?
329,329, She took Varya...
330,330, Who are you talking about?
331,331, You don't remember her either.
332,332, Can you hear?
333,333, No.
334,334, It's so quiet.
335,335,"Hey, moron."
336,336,We have some business to do.
337,337, Just go inside and look whether there is somebody.
338,338,And then open the door.
339,339,Do you understand?
340,340, Why do you need the can?
341,341," You think you're the smartest, huh?"
342,342, Don't touch me.
343,343," Hey, get off her!"
344,344, Don't meddle in their affairs.
345,345,Wow.
346,346, Now what?
347,347,You think you're so brave?
348,348, Put the knife away.
349,349,I'll go.
350,350,"Guys, you have to see this."
351,351,Has he been spying on us?
352,352,Freaking maniac...
353,353,"Eva, call the police."
354,354, Have you lost your mind?
355,355,We'll get arrested for breaking into a house.
356,356, This is our nanny.
357,357, My music tutor.
358,358, She's cute.
359,359,"Don't sweat it, that's Misha."
360,360,Hi there.
361,361,It's you again.
362,362,I have warned you...
363,363,I could've handled it.
364,364, Who's that?
365,365,Do you know her?
366,366," Turn off the lights, kids."
367,367, Are you deaf? We asked you a question. Answer it.
368,368, This is my wife.
369,369,She died after our daughter had disappeared.
370,370, Died? He killed her!
371,371,Everyone knows that.
372,372, Has your daughter gone missing?
373,373," Kids have been disappearing for a while now, but nobody remembers them."
374,374,It seems that even their parents don't need them.
375,375, Tell us everything you know.
376,376,One day I woke up with a feeling that I lost something.
377,377,Something important. But I couldn't remember what it was.
378,378,There was only a candle burning.
379,379,"Whenever I looked at the candle, I somehow recalled this old dream that I had almost forgotten."
380,380,A dream about my baby.
381,381,Electricity â that's how I knew that evil came to the city.
382,382,"Every time some child disappeared, there had been power cuts in the area."
383,383,I began following the kids and taking pictures of them.
384,384,"Whenever the kid suddenly disappeared from the photo, it meant everyone has forgotten him."
385,385,That's how I could track how many children were missing.
386,386,I've been trying to find my daughter for many years.
387,387,But I haven't succeeded.
388,388,"I settled here, in the forest."
389,389,But I haven't found anything here except red threads.
390,390, But who needs children to be forgotten?
391,391,Who's been taking them away?
392,392, Someone they trust.
393,393,Someone who can easily enter the house.
394,394, Are you saying that your wife comes and takes children to the forest?
395,395, That's not her.
396,396," Eva, have you heard?"
397,397, Woman. Steal. Children.
398,398,Forest.
399,399,Your request matches a Slavic demon who lives on the border between the living and the dead  Baba Yaga.
400,400," Eva, are you serious?"
401,401, There's nothing to make fun of.
402,402, What about this place?
403,403,Have you been there?
404,404, Many times.
405,405,That's an abandoned power station.
406,406,You won't find anything there.
407,407,It doesn't work.
408,408," Believe me, it does."
409,409, We should have untied him.
410,410, We'll do it on our way back.
411,411,Hey! Do you really believe him?
412,412,"This guy's obviously crazy, but you seem sane."
413,413," What do you want? I'm going to get my sister back, do you understand?"
414,414,We don't need you at all.
415,415,You can go if you want.
416,416, I don't need you either.
417,417," Okay, let's go."
418,418,Are you coming?
419,419,You'll forget everything.
420,420, Where do these ropes come from?
421,421, They lead to the hut.
422,422," Wow, that's huge."
423,423, Shhh!
424,424, Take it easy!
425,425, It looks so old.
426,426, I'll be quick.
427,427, Be careful.
428,428," Don't get electrocuted, dumbass."
429,429," Guys, I found something strange in here!"
430,430, Egor!
431,431, Don't go in there.
432,432, Coward!
433,433, I haven't seen you for quite some time.
434,434, I've had some business to do.
435,435,Did you miss me?
436,436, I don't want you to leave ever again.
437,437, How could you let him go?
438,438,When the boy comes back...
439,439, I'll kill him.
440,440, And I'll be always with you.
441,441, Are you okay?
442,442, What happened?
443,443, I actually don't know.
444,444,I blacked out.
445,445, Me too.
446,446, Get up.
447,447, Hey!
448,448,I thought you came here to look for your sister.
449,449,Is there actually a sister?
450,450," Cut it out, Anton."
451,451, Maybe there isn't any sister?
452,452, Are you jealous?
453,453, Why did you take her to the forest?
454,454,Did you want to have some privacy?
455,455, It's none of your business.
456,456,I didn't drag either you or her here.
457,457, But you asked us to follow you.
458,458,You know what?
459,459,I'm sick of you both.
460,460, Dasha!
461,461,Dasha!
462,462,Dasha!
463,463,Wait!
464,464," No sister, no girlfriend, huh?"
465,465, Stop it!
466,466,Screw you!
467,467,You're really mental.
468,468, Varya!
469,469, Mom! Are you at home?
470,470,Mom?
471,471," Dad, are you at home?"
472,472, Hey!
473,473," Julia, look."
474,474,Julia!
475,475,Julia! Julia!
476,476, When... The boy...will come...
477,477," Alexey, what's wrong?"
478,478," Eva, please talk to me."
479,479, Good evening! How are you?
480,480," I'm lonely, hurt and scared."
481,481," Your request ""I'm scared"" matches ""death"", ""fear"", ""horror""..."
482,482," Eva, what's going on?"
483,483," ... ""death"", ""fear"", ""horror""..."
484,484,"""dying of loneliness""."
485,485, Dasha?
486,486, What's happening?
487,487,We're not at home.
488,488,It's not our world.
489,489,I know where my sister is.
490,490,Nobody needs you.
491,491,They will forget you.
492,492, Last time I saw something in here.
493,493,Here.
494,494, Who are you? You have a very distinct smell.
495,495, And who are you?
496,496, Shh!
497,497,"Hush, baby. Don't cry!"
498,498, Varya.
499,499,This is my sister.
500,500, She's so small.
501,501,She cried so loudly in the witch's den.
502,502, What witch?
503,503, Is it her? The witch?
504,504, Nobody's ever seen the witch.
505,505,She can't leave her den.
506,506,There are scary invisible birds who bring children to her.
507,507, Who?
508,508, They're called the Navs.
509,509,They help the witch.
510,510,They can sense the smell of memories just like predators sense blood.
511,511,It's important to keep your brightest memory.
512,512,We remain alive as long as we're remembered.
513,513,"Once we're forgotten, we disappear."
514,514, What?
515,515, Look at me.
516,516, You're being forgotten.
517,517, We should get back to the furnace.
518,518, You can't go there.
519,519,You can die.
520,520,The forest is dangerous at night the Navs can catch you.
521,521,Hide!
522,522,Don't leave the shelter.
523,523,The cloak will hide your smell.
524,524,"Shh, quiet!"
525,525," Hush, Varya."
526,526," Hey, where are you going?"
527,527, Hey! Help!
528,528," Shh, quiet. Don't scream."
529,529," Hey, bro."
530,530,She is going to wake up now.
531,531, We must return home.
532,532,Take the blanket.
533,533, What for?
534,534, So they don't sense our smell.
535,535,Egor! Help me get out of here.
536,536,Help me come back.
537,537, What is it? There's nobody there.
538,538, Mom?
539,539, Shh!
540,540,Don't be scared.
541,541,"The more you resist, the stronger they tighten up."
542,542,We can escape while the witch isn't hungry.
543,543,There's nobody there. Let's go!
544,544, Mom's calling.
545,545,Mom!
546,546,Mom!
547,547, Egor!
548,548, Mom!
549,549, Wait! Stop!
550,550, Egor?
551,551, Varya.
552,552," This isn't your first time here, is it?"
553,553, I've escaped from here many times.
554,554,"While the witch is eating, the others can break away."
555,555, Are you okay?
556,556, Better not ask!
557,557, Go into the furnace.
558,558," There's no passage there, I've tried it many times."
559,559,We should go back to my house.
560,560, Wait!
561,561,"Please, come with us. Your dad is waiting for you."
562,562,We can make it.
563,563," Guys, we have to go."
564,564, I told you â there's no way back.
565,565, No.
566,566,There must be a way out.
567,567, That's impossible. Unless...
568,568,you've already died once.
569,569,You're the one the witch is looking for.
570,570, The candle went out. He forgot me.
571,571, Let's go! Hurry!
572,572," Please, keep your brightest memory."
573,573, This thing will come back.
574,574,What are we going to do?
575,575," We'll come up with something, okay?"
576,576, Dad! Julia!
577,577, Who are you?
578,578,What are you doing here?
579,579,"Get out of my house, ragamuffin!"
580,580,Out!
581,581, Mom!
582,582, Was that you who broke my window?
583,583, I saw your daughter.
584,584, What daughter?
585,585,If I see you again...
586,586,Get out!
587,587," Who are you, little boy?"
588,588,How did you get in here?
589,589,Why are you crying?
590,590,I think I know you.
591,591,And one more thing...But it's a secret.
592,592,Every night I see this dream about a little crying girl.
593,593,Then I wake up.
594,594,Am I crazy?
595,595, You can hear her?
596,596,"Julia, this is very serious."
597,597,"If you remember her, she's still alive."
598,598,Her name is Varya.
599,599,Do you remember?
600,600, My little Varya.
601,601," Julia, I have to go."
602,602,"Please, think of Varya."
603,603, Varya...
604,604, Real men must protect those who are dear to them.
605,605,"Dad! Please, stop."
606,606,It's me.
607,607, Let him go!
608,608,"Run, Egor, I can handle him."
609,609,"Alexey, remember, that's your son!"
610,610, I don't understand what's going on.
611,611, Everyone's forgotten us.
612,612," So what? You're forgotten, but I haven't been noticed my whole life."
613,613,I don't see any difference.
614,614,Why are you being so limp?
615,615,I'm sure your sister's still alive.
616,616,"We'll come back for her and destroy the furnace, so the kids won't disappear anymore."
617,617, We need to figure out how to kill Baba Yaga.
618,618, What about a good old way?
619,619, We'll burn the witch!
620,620, I'll teach you to break into my property.
621,621, Remember your daughter.
622,622,We need your help.
623,623,You have to remember.
624,624, Have you seen her?
625,625,Have you seen my daughter?
626,626, Yes. There's a passage in the furnace.
627,627, But she's gone.
628,628,She didn't make it.
629,629, I would feel it if she died.
630,630," It's true, she's gone. I saw it."
631,631, She's alive!
632,632,Where's the passage?
633,633," Stay here. If I don't come back, burn everything down."
634,634, We'll all go. Together.
635,635,Honey.
636,636,Come to me.
637,637,Honey.
638,638," Egor, what took you so long?"
639,639, It can't be true.
640,640,You're not here.
641,641," Baby, you're so special."
642,642,You can cross the borders of the worlds.
643,643,Now I know it. We can leave this place together.
644,644, No.
645,645, Your friends forgot you.
646,646,Your father forgot you.
647,647,But I love you.
648,648,Get rid of the girl.
649,649,"Give her life to me, so we can be together again."
650,650, I don't want to.
651,651,You're not my mother.
652,652,My mother is dead!
653,653, What's happening?
654,654," Tanya, remember me!"
655,655,"Our daughter, Tanya! We can save her."
656,656, She promised to bring her back...
657,657,if I bring her the boy.
658,658,Help me get out.
659,659,Or you will die.
660,660, He has parents who love him too.
661,661,Like you used to love our daughter.
662,662, He has parents too.
663,663,Real men must protect those who are dear to them.
664,664,No one will remember you.
665,665,No. We remember each other.
666,666,Over here! Come get us!
667,667,You're the one they'll forget!
668,668,Hey you!
669,669," Alexey, look."
670,670," Wait, give it to me."
671,671," That's enough, put it back."
672,672," Oh, come on."
673,673," Right, enough."
674,674," Guys, stop it. Let's take a photo."
675,675, Aren't you afraid that your friend will come out?
676,676, I have you by my side.
677,677, Would you like to join us?
678,678," One, two, three."
679,679," God, that's an ugly face."
680,680,Come.
681,681,I need your help.
682,682, What's wrong?
683,683,She can't be killed.
684,684,She'll come back.
685,685,Shhh!
