423,423,This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny.
424,424,"Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear."
425,425,The Inner Map Theory is an example ...
426,426,"of how each soul begins with an imprint, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul ..."
427,427,before you've even gotten here.
428,428,"You know, I guess the reason why I like Japan the best ..."
429,429,"out of all Asian countries, is because I really feel close to Buddhism."
430,430,I really feel ...
431,431,I really believe in reincarnation.
432,432,"That's part of what drew me to Midnight Velocity as well, because although Keanu dies, he eventually gets reincarnated."
433,433,"So there's hope. There's hope in reincarnation, I think."
434,434,What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?
435,435,"He was always so ... He was always, you know, giving me ideas, and, you know, really helpful."
436,436,"He made me feel really comfortable, so ..."
437,437,"And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A., so we have all these different things in common."
438,438,"So, you know, we both really like Mexican food, and yoga and ..."
439,439,karate!
440,440,Mexican food. Yoga.
441,441,Konnichiwa.

452,452,Thank you. Hi. Thanks.
453,453,What can I get you?

458,458,"So, what are you doing here?"
459,459,A couple of things.
460,460,"Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday ..."
461,461,and getting paid $2 million ...
462,462,to endorse a whisky ...
463,463,when I could be doing a play somewhere.
464,464,Oh.
465,465,"But the good news is, the whisky works."
466,466,What are you doing?
467,467,"My husband's a photographer, so he's here working, and I wasn't doing anything, so I came along."
468,468,And we have some friends that live here.
469,469,How long have you been married?
470,470,Thank you.
471,471,Two years.
472,472,Twentyfive long ones.
473,473,You're probably just having a midlife crisis.
474,474,Did you buy a Porsche yet?
475,475,"You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche."
476,476,Twentyfive years. That's a ...
477,477,"Well, it's impressive."
478,478,"Well, you figure you sleep onethird of your life."
479,479,That knocks off eight years of marriage right there.
480,480,So you're down to 16 and change.
481,481,You're just a teenager at marriage.
482,482,"You can drive it, but there's still the occasional accident."
483,483,Yeah.
484,484,What do you do?
485,485,"I'm not sure yet, actually."
486,486,I just graduated last spring.
487,487,What did you study?
488,488,Philosophy.
489,489,"Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket."
490,490,Yeah.
491,491,"Well, so far it's pro bono."
492,492,"Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles."
493,493,Yeah.
494,494,I hope your Porsche works out.
495,495,"Cheers to that, huh?"
496,496,Cheers to that.
497,497,Wish I could sleep.
498,498,"Me, too."
499,499,"âª One, two, three, and okay âª All right."
500,500,"âª One, two, three, four âª âª And one, two, three, four âª âª And one, two ... âª ~ Wait! Take me with you! ~ How'd it go, huh?"
501,501,"Oh, it was good, you know."
502,502,I'm tired.
503,503,"Yeah, I gotta go downstairs and meet Kelly for some drinks."
504,504,She wants to talk about some photo thing.
505,505,Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.
506,506,"Oh, you wanna come?"
507,507,"Yeah, sure."
508,508,Okay. Yeah.
509,509,"âª You âª âª Stepped out of a dream âª Everybody is always like, ""Kelly, you are anorexic."" And I'm like, ""No, I'm not."" I eat so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it."
510,510,Just because I have a high metabolism.
511,511,Because I thought you were anorexic too.
512,512,Everybody does.
513,513,Everybody thinks that.
514,514,"Yeah, 'cause you look so ..."
515,515,"Thank you. I know, but it's ..."
516,516,"I mean, I eat whatever."
517,517,I have a really high metabolism.
518,518, Yeah.
519,519, But ...
520,520,My dad is an anorexic.
521,521, Really?
522,522," Oh, really?"
523,523,Yeah.
524,524,He fought on the American side of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.
525,525,"He was taken prisoner, and the whole time he was there they tortured him about food."
526,526,Every day they told him they put poison in the food.
527,527,So they would always make themselves throw up after every meal.
528,528,That's horrible. That's terrible.
529,529,That's some crazy shit.
530,530, You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
531,531, No.
532,532,"You know that break beat, right?"
533,533,"Well, I been taking it to some next level shit."
534,534,"Like, I'll take that and put a delay on it, so it's like ..."
535,535,"So it's, like, evolving the beat."
536,536,"So it, like, sounds hella large on the track. You know what I'm saying?"
537,537, No.
538,538, No?
539,539,You don't listen to hiphop?
540,540,"Oh, my God!"
541,541,You guys gotta listen.
542,542,I tried this power cleanse.
543,543,It's so amazing.
544,544,"Okay, promise me you'll try it."
545,545,Will you try this power cleanse?
546,546," I did it last week, and it's amazing."
547,547, I'll be right back.
548,548,"It's so good to get the toxins out of your body, you know."
549,549,"With all, like, the pollution, all, like, the ..."
550,550, Hello.
551,551, Hello.
552,552,You ever switch seats?
553,553,"I like this one. If I fall, someone will notice."
554,554,Yeah.
555,555,"So, you having a nice time?"
556,556,Can you keep a secret?
557,557,I'm trying to organize a prison break.
558,558,"I'm looking for, like, an accomplice."
559,559,"We'd have to, first, get out of this bar."
560,560,"Then the hotel, then the city and then the country."
561,561,"Are you in, or are you out?"
562,562,I'm in.
563,563,Good. I'll go pack my stuff.
564,564,Get your coat.
565,565,See you.
566,566,I hope you've had enough to drink.
567,567,It's gonna take courage.
568,568,"Oh, look. The label got me these."
569,569,I love Cristal.
570,570,You wanna have some?
571,571,"Well, I'm ... I gotta go."
572,572,"I mean, I ..."
573,573,"You know, you don't have to stay."
574,574,I mean ...
575,575,"You don't have to go, do you?"
576,576,"Well, I ..."
577,577,I know. You're gonna be working the whole time.
578,578,I'll have a much better time here.
579,579,I'll call Charlie and those guys.
580,580,Yeah! Call those guys.
581,581,"And I'm gonna be back on Sunday, and I ..."
582,582,"I love you, you know."
583,583,Okay? I love you.
584,584,I'll see you. Okay?
585,585,"Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple of ... a couple of days."
586,586,Bye.
587,587,I love you.
588,588,Hello.
589,589, Hello.
590,590, How are you?
591,591, Good. How are you?
592,592,"It's a cool pool, isn't it?"
593,593,"Yeah, it's nice."
594,594,Get any sleep?
595,595,Not yet. How about you?
596,596,No. Not yet.
597,597,How long you staying for?
598,598,I'll be in the bar for the rest of the week.
599,599,"Well, that's good."
600,600,"I'm going out with some friends later, if you wanna come ..."
601,601,Sure.
602,602,Okay. I'll see you later.
603,603, Okay.
604,604, See you.
605,605,Which one is burgundy?
606,606,Hold on!
607,607,Hold on.
608,608,"You really are having a midlife crisis, huh?"
609,609,"Really? Yeah, I was afraid of that."
610,610,I kept telling myself that I just wanted to be ready in case we go to war tonight.
611,611,My bathroom is messier than yours.
612,612,And it's not like you're not trying.
613,613,"Here, will you cut the tag out for me?"
614,614,Sure.
615,615,You're too tall.
616,616,"Anybody ever tell you, you may be too small?"
617,617,Whose is this?
618,618,"""A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling."" I don't know."
619,619, I have that.
620,620," Did it work out for you, then?"
621,621,Obviously.
622,622,Okay.
623,623,Where's your shoes?
624,624,They're over here.
625,625,Where's your room key?
626,626,It's in my bag.
627,627,And where's your bag?
628,628,It's right here.
629,629, Let's go.
630,630, Wait!

642,642,"His real name's Hayashi, but ..."
643,643,Why do they call you Charlie Brown?
644,644,"Everybody say, ""He looks like Charlie Brown."" You know, Snoopy, man."
645,645,"Oh, I'll be right back."
646,646,"Bob, over here. These are my friends."
647,647,Very beautiful.
648,648,"She's ""B"", and she's Rico, and she's Myumi."

700,700,And we camp over there on the beach.
701,701,"In fact, we made a kind of ..."
702,702,Wait. What kind of weed is it?

709,709,It wasn't even close.
710,710,Blows the others away.
711,711,"~ I'm glad you like it. ~ I saw a great house tonight that you would've loved, and that burgundy would've been good in this house, really."
712,712,~ Really? ~ A guy designed his own house and built it.
713,713,"~ Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it. ~ He's a fashion guy."
714,714,All these fashion people were there.
715,715,"And there were Japanese surfers there, and the guy was playing really, really, really great music."
716,716,I should've found out what it was and brought some ...
717,717,I'll bring some back.
718,718,I'll try to find out.
719,719,~ That sounds great.
720,720,Can you hold on? ~ ~ You have to have something for breakfast. Do you want some cereal? ~ Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.
721,721,~ I'm just trying to get her to eat something. ~ Yeah. Tell her I said she has to eat something.
722,722,~ Your dad says eat something.
723,723, No. ~ Eat. Tell her I said so.
724,724,~ She won't eat anything.
725,725,"Forget it. ~ ~ Look, I'm glad you're having fun. ~ It's not fun. It's just ..."
726,726,"It's just very, very different."

732,732,"~ All right. ~ I mean, I guess have a great morning, huh?"
733,733,"~ Good night, Bob. Good night. ~ Good night."
734,734,I love you.
735,735,That was a stupid idea.
736,736," I was feeling tight, you know?"
737,737, Mmmhmm.
738,738, Shoulders and neck.
739,739, Mmmhmm.
740,740,So I called down and had a ...
741,741,shiatsu massage in my room.
742,742,That's nice.
743,743,And the tightness has completely disappeared ...
744,744,and been replaced by ...
745,745,unbelievable pain.
746,746,"Just staggering, unbearable pain."
747,747,That's too bad.
748,748, Yeah.
749,749, I'm in pain.
750,750,"I got my foot banged up, and ..."
751,751,Wanna see it?
752,752,"How do you say ""No""?"
753,753," Oh, my gosh!"
754,754, I know.
755,755,That's ...
756,756,How ... when did you do this?
757,757,I did it the other day.
758,758,"It hurts, you know?"
759,759,Didn't you feel any pain? Your ...
760,760,"Yeah, it really hurt."
761,761,It was ...
762,762,Yeah. That toe is almost dead.
763,763,I think I gotta take you to a doctor.
764,764,You can't just put that back in the shoe.
765,765,No. I don't think so.
766,766,"Well, you either go to a doctor, or you leave it here."
767,767,He's smiling.
768,768,You like that idea?
769,769,"See, they love black toe over in this country."
770,770,You got a sharp knife?
771,771,"Gotta be, you know, in this country, somebody's gotta prefer a black toe."
772,772,"""Brack toe."" Or we should probably hang around until someone orders it."
773,773,"Hey, what's with the straight face?"
774,774,Hospital regulations.
775,775,Get in there.
776,776, All right. Thank you.
777,777, All right.
778,778,"Careful, okay? No, don't!"
779,779, No!
780,780," Hey, use the horn, fella."
781,781,"Let's try ""Mixed Internal""."
782,782,Yeah. Go.
783,783,"Switched to beer, huh?"
784,784,Go. Go.
785,785,You might want to switch to sake.

787,787,Hi.
788,788, Hi.
789,789, Hi.
790,790,Yeah. We need a doctor.

792,792,It's not an emergency.
793,793,I just hurt my foot.
794,794,"Okay, do we fill this out?"
795,795,We go over there?
796,796,Which number?
797,797,"We're not going to another hospital, so whatever you say is okay."
798,798,Okay.
799,799,Could you put that back in the garage for us?

811,811,"I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called Orange around 10:00, so I'll fax you a map on how to get there."

835,835,You were very dashing.
836,836,I liked the mascara.
837,837,But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
838,838,Really?
839,839,You don't remember?
840,840,"I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?"
841,841,Did I scowl at you?
842,842,"No, you smiled."
843,843,I did?
844,844,"Yes, it was a complete accident."
845,845,A freak. I haven't seen it since.
846,846,Just that one time.
847,847,"Like that, but bigger."
848,848,"Bigger. Yeah, big, big ..."
849,849,"Well, not that big."
850,850,"~ My goodness. ~ ~ Marcello, come here. Hurry up. ~ Why do they switch the ""R's"" and the ""L's"" here?"
851,851,"Oh, for yuks."
852,852,"You know, just to mix it up."
853,853,"They have to amuse themselves, 'cause we're not making them laugh."
854,854,"Let's never come here again, 'cause it would never be as much fun."
855,855,Whatever you say. You're the boss.
856,856,I'm stuck.
857,857,Does it get easier?
858,858,No.
859,859,Yes.
860,860,It gets easier.
861,861,"Oh, yeah?"
862,862,Look at you.
863,863,Thanks.
864,864,"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let ..."
865,865,things upset you.
866,866,Yeah.
867,867,I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.
868,868,You know?
869,869,"I tried being a writer, but ..."
870,870,I hate what I write.
871,871,"And I tried taking pictures, but they're so mediocre, you know."
872,872,Every girl goes through a photography phase.
873,873,"You know, like horses?"
874,874,You know?
875,875,Take dumb pictures of your feet.
876,876,You'll figure that out.
877,877,I'm not worried about you.
878,878,Keep writing.
879,879,But I'm so mean.
880,880, Mean's okay.
881,881, Yeah?
882,882,What about marriage?
883,883,Does that get easier?
884,884,That's hard.
885,885,We used to have a lot of fun.
886,886,"Lydia would come with me when I made the movies, and we would laugh about it all."
887,887,"Now she doesn't want to leave the kids, and she doesn't ..."
888,888,need me to be there.
889,889,"The kids miss me, but they're fine."
890,890,It gets a whole lot more complicated when you have kids.
891,891,Yeah. It's scary.
892,892,It's the most terrifying day of your life ...
893,893,the day the first one is born.
894,894,Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.
895,895,"Your life, as you know it, is gone."
896,896,Never to return.
897,897,"But they learn how to walk, and they learn how to talk, and ..."
898,898,And you want to be with them.
899,899,And they turn out to be the most ...
900,900,delightful people ...
901,901,you will ever meet in your life.
902,902,"Hmm, that's nice."
903,903,Where'd you grow up?
904,904,"I grew up in New York, and I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married."
905,905,But it's so different there.
906,906,"Yeah, I know."
907,907,John thinks I'm so snotty.
908,908,You're not hopeless.

942,942,"~ Is this a bad time? ~ No, it's always a good time."
943,943,"~ Look, your burgundy carpet isn't in stock. ~ ~ It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did you like any of the other colors? ~ Whatever you like."
944,944,I'm completely lost.
945,945,~ It's just carpet. ~ That's not what I'm talking about.
946,946,~ What are you talking about? ~ I don't know.
947,947,I just want to get healthy.
948,948,"You know, I want to take better care of myself."
949,949,I would like to start eating healthier.
950,950,I don't want all that pasta.
951,951,"~ What? ~ I would like to start eating, like, Japanese food."
952,952,"~ Well, why don't you just stay there, and you can have it every day? ~ How are the kids doing?"
953,953,~ They're fine.
954,954,"They miss their father. ~ ~ But they're getting used to you not being here. ~ ~ Do I need to worry about you, Bob? ~ Only if you want to."
