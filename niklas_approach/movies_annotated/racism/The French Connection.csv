437,437,Why did you choose to come by ship?
438,438,The next several weeks will be very difficult for me...
439,439,and the middle of the ocean is the only place...
440,440,where the telephone isn't ringing all the time.
441,441,"Mr. Devereaux, do you agree with the recent survey finding..."

462,462,You had a little trouble.
463,463, But don't get off on the wrong foot?

632,632,You know? Originally.
633,633,We don't want any feds screwin' it up.
634,634,Case? So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
635,635,"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
636,636, Get out  Knock it off.
637,637," Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."

649,649, So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
650,650, How many kilos?
651,651, Sixty.
652,652, Sixty kilos?
653,653,"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
654,654,This stuff'll take a 7to1 hit on the street.
655,655,"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
656,656,"Thank you, Howard. Take what's left there with you, and good night."
657,657,Not that one. The little one.
658,658, I guess we got a deal?
659,659," What we got here, Sal, is a test."
660,660,A deal for half a million dollars?
661,661,Maybe.
662,662,Maybe?
663,663,"Come on, Joel. I know that guy's in a hurry. Wants the bread."
664,664,He wants to go back to France. This guy's not gonna hang around and play games.
665,665,"Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across."
666,666,"What am I, a schmuck?"
667,667,What's the hurry?
668,668,He could see a couple of shows...
669,669,visit the top of the Empire State Building.
670,670,"Don't jerk me, Weinstock."
671,671,I spent a lot of time settin' this one up.
672,672,"So what do you want, a badge?"
673,673,"This is your first major league game, Sal."
674,674,One thing I learned...
675,675,"Move calmly, move cautiously."
676,676,You'll never be sorry.
677,677,Look. I've been damn careful up to now.
678,678,This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawling all over you like fleas.
679,679,"Look, I'm telling you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
680,680,So let him take his 60 kilos of heroin someplace else...
681,681,and find how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
682,682,He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this kind of business.
683,683,The stuff is here!
684,684,We could make the switch in an hour!
685,685,"Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you."
686,686,He'll split if we don't move!
687,687,This guy's got 'em like that.
688,688,He's everything they say he is.
689,689,"What about you, Sal?"
690,690,Are you everything they say you are?
691,691,I'll be a son of a bitch.
692,692,Come on!

696,696,"Yeah, I know that."
697,697,We got the Westbury covered like a tent.
698,698,"The Westbury, my ass!"
699,699,I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.
700,700,"Now, what the hell's goin' on up there?"
701,701,"I make him coming out of the hotel, free as a bird. There wasn't a soul awake."
702,702,What the hell are you talking about?
703,703,"Yeah, well..."
704,704,"Listen, I don't care how many bartenders you got that are sick."
705,705,"Nah, I'm not workin' that joint."
706,706,That's right.
707,707,"Same to you, buddy."
708,708,Can I get a grape drink?
709,709,Watch the closing doors.
710,710,You son of a bitch!

721,721,So?
722,722,"So everything's going great, terrific, beautiful."
723,723,I'll need a few more days though.
724,724,The boys think we oughta cool it for a while...
725,725,just to make sure there's no heat.
726,726,You must take me for an imbecile.
727,727,Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
728,728,I haven't spent five minutes in New York City...
729,729,without the company of a policeman.
730,730,"Look, I'm leveling with you."
731,731,I need a little more time.
732,732,It's just that my people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch.
733,733, That's all.
734,734, It has to be by the end of this week.
735,735,"Look, Charnier."
736,736,You got to be reasonable.
737,737,It's your problem.
738,738,"Well, it's your problem too."
739,739,It's so nice to have seen you again.
740,740,I don't want to get into this.
741,741,I gotta have time.
742,742,I can't get any more time.
743,743," Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
744,744, You're not gonna get it.
745,745,We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
746,746,His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
747,747,She's dead.
748,748, Give the car a complete toss.
749,749, I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
750,750,"Jimmy, give it up. Give it up."
751,751,It's all over with.
752,752,"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
753,753,We blew it.
754,754,We blew our warrants.
755,755,We blew our cover.
756,756,"Walter, listen."
757,757,I know the deal hasn't gone down.
758,758,I I know it. I can feel it.
759,759,I'm dead certain.

839,839,Ten after 4:00.
840,840,That's the third time those guys have been around.
841,841,All right. Let's hit 'em! Hit 'em!
842,842,Freeze!
843,843,All right. Nobody move!
844,844,Put your hands in the air!
845,845,Get over... Get over there! Hey!
846,846,Get up there!
847,847,Spread those fucking legs!
848,848,Now stay right there!
849,849,"You move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off!"
850,850, What the hell's that?
851,851, What are you doing? Turn around!
852,852," Man, I have my rights."
853,853," What do you mean, your rights?"
854,854,Who's the boss here?
855,855,"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
856,856, I am.
857,857, You are?
858,858, What are you doing here? Who sent you down?
859,859, Just runnin' around.
860,860,"Don't talk back to me, man."
861,861,What are you doing here?
862,862," We saw the car, man."
863,863, You heist this car?
864,864,No. We was breaking down the tires.
865,865,That's all it was.
866,866,Lock 'em up.
867,867,Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up.
868,868," All of you, come on."
869,869, Come on! Come on!
870,870,Come on. Stop draggin' your ass.
871,871,Keep your hands on your head.
872,872,"You dumb spics, get outta here!"
873,873,Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!
874,874,Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.
875,875, Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
876,876, Are you bullshittin' me?
877,877,That car's dirty.
878,878,Take it in and tear it apart.
879,879,Tear it right out. Tear it out!
880,880,"Nothing here, Jimmy."
881,881,Look in here.
882,882,This is all solid.
883,883,There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
884,884,That thing is clean.
885,885,"I don't buy that, Irv."
886,886,The stuff is in that car.
887,887,"Well, you find it. I can't."
888,888,"Look, the car was lost some time last night."
889,889,"First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here. Then what?"
890,890,I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront.
891,891,You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan...
892,892,and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge?
893,893,"Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television."
894,894,He probably left the car to look at some point of interest.
895,895,We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.
896,896,I demand its immediate return.
897,897,"You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux."
898,898,"We get 400, 500 cars here a day."
899,899,Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country.
900,900,He's working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.
901,901,Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
902,902,Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film...
903,903,I suggest you locate the car immediately.
904,904,"You're in a nosmoking area, sir."
905,905,Will you please extinguish your cigarettes?
906,906,"What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv?"
907,907,You sure?
908,908,"That's what it was... 4,795 pounds..."
909,909,when it came into the shop.
910,910,"The owner's manual says 4,675."
911,911,It's 120 pounds overweight.
912,912,"And when it was booked into Marseille, it was 4,795."
913,913,That's still 120 pounds overweight.
914,914,Jimmy's gotta be right.
915,915,"Listen, I ripped everything out of there except the rocker panels."
916,916,"Come on, Irv!"
917,917,What the hell is that?
918,918,"Well, shit!"
919,919,Son of a bitch.
920,920,All right.
921,921,It isn't the only car we have here.
922,922,"Got it for you, Randy."
923,923,It just came in from downtown.
924,924, Who's Devereaux?
925,925, I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?
926,926,"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux..."
927,927,"but we get a lot of cars here at night, and sometimes it's hard to keep track..."
928,928, You mean the car is here now?
929,929," Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside."
930,930,They stole it right off the street from you?
931,931,Goddamn.
932,932,"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
933,933,"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
934,934,"Well, that's New York."
935,935,Is this your first trip over here?
936,936," Yeah. Where's my car, please?"
937,937, It's right over here.
938,938,But you're lucky this time.
939,939,It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch.
940,940,You must lead a charming life.
941,941,Henri.
942,942,Je vous attendais.
943,943, Let's go!
944,944, Bon voyage.
945,945,Merci.
946,946,"I would give you a ride, but..."
947,947,"Tom, take care."
948,948,"Take care, baby."
949,949,Lou!
950,950,Yea!
951,951, Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight?
952,952," Okay, babe. Take care?"
953,953,We made a good strike?
954,954,What happened with Sal?
955,955,What's the matter with him?
956,956,They got the bridge blocked off!
957,957,Let me in! Open the door.
958,958,This is the police!
959,959,You're surrounded!
960,960,Come out with your hands up!
961,961,This is the police! You're surrounded!
962,962,Bring out the gas!
963,963,Hold your fire!
964,964,Stop!
965,965,Stop!
966,966,We're coming out! Hold your fire!
967,967,Drop the guns!
968,968,Over here! Move it. Let's go!
969,969,Popeye?
970,970,It's me! It's me!
971,971,Frog One is in that room.
972,972,Drop it!
973,973,Mulderig.
974,974,You shot Mulderig.
975,975,The son of a bitch is here.
976,976,I saw him. I'm gonna get him.
