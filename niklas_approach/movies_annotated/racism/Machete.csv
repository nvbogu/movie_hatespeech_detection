446,446,I think David is going to ask me to marry him.
447,447,But I have my priorities.
448,448,School and a career.
449,449,Salsa!
450,450,Actually I was thinking more about my modeling.
451,451,"You are a very pretty girl April, but that's tough enough to crack."
452,452,I know all about cracking nuts.
453,453,Do you even know how many hits I get on my website?
454,454,You own a website? She has a website? Did you know about this?
455,455,I know all about what the online public wants.
456,456,And they want ME!
457,457,All of ME!
458,458,That does it. I'm sending you to a convent.
459,459,What?
460,460,He's loose. He got away.
461,461,God Damn! How hard is it for you to kill a god damn day labourer?
462,462,You get to that corner where I picked him up.
463,463,You find him!
464,464,Do IT!
465,465,Seen a big wagon?
466,466,No... No speak English.
467,467,Speak. 45?
468,468,Where's the tacos truck lady at?
469,469,Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen her this morning. She's late.
470,470,She...
471,471,You know where you lives...
472,472,Alright... go get him.
473,473,You're all over the god damn TV.
474,474,Get in!
475,475,Agent You're the second beautiful girl that picked me up today.
476,476,Exploding houses!
477,477,Bodies falling from the sky!
478,478,Jesus Christ Machete...
479,479,You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!
480,480,Ya! I know who you are...
481,481,I'm Santana Evira.
482,482,Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).
483,483,ICE.
484,484,Fuckin' eh! Immigration...
485,485,"Don't worry, I won't ship you back, if you tell me what I need to know."
486,486,Working my way up.
487,487,I can't be busting people like tacos stands anymore.
488,488,"Well, I'm probably related to half of them."
489,489,You need me more than I need you.
490,490,Come on.
491,491,You know all the cops in this state are hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.
492,492,I wasn't gonna kill him.
493,493,"Just gonna shoot him in the neck, Stop him from saying all those stupid things."
494,494,It was a set up.
495,495,There was another shooter there.
496,496,There was another shooter?
497,497,Who?
498,498,Drive!
499,499,Drive.
500,500,I know what they did to your family.
501,501,"And if I were you I wouldn't trust anyone neither, but it's different here."
502,502,Laws are enforced.
503,503,And people control them.
504,504,Not drug lords.
505,505,The system works here...
506,506,Says you.
507,507,I started working on the night shift taking out the trash.
508,508,But I worked my way up.
509,509,"As translator, assistant..."
510,510,Now I'm special agent in charge of investigations.
511,511,Sounds like they still got you taking out the trash.
512,512,Let me take you in...
513,513,Put you into witness protection.
514,514,All you got to do is tell me who hired you to take out the senator.
515,515,Fine.
516,516,Holy Shit.
517,517,You mean to tell me that a Mexican daily is a god damn Federale?
518,518,"That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled in one mean fucking burrito."
519,519,Is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?
520,520,Yes.
521,521,And so far you failed.
522,522,So far.
523,523,"I'm sorry to see you have a high tolerance for failure, beautiful."
524,524,I don't...
525,525,not bad The last time we spoke you could have mentioned that he was a god damn Federale!
526,526,God Dammit!
527,527,"Notoriously is hard to kill, trust me."
528,528,I've tried.
529,529,"Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in."
530,530,The very best the great state of Texas has to offer.
531,531,Osiris Amanpour.
532,532,If Machete is captured alive.
533,533,He'll expose my entire operation.
534,534,"You have 24 hours take him down, or I'll come over there myself..."
535,535,And I'll kill him myself.
536,536,"Sorry, my friend."
537,537,My grandfather always says you can solve any problem with food.
538,538,"And you my friend, have plenty of problems."
539,539,So who you working for?
540,540,Who wants the senator dead?
541,541,Is it The Network?
542,542,Luz?
543,543,She doesn't know anything about it.
544,544,Network either.
545,545,The man who hired me...
546,546,was a Mexican.
547,547,Really So he was just a random guy who says...
548,548,"hey, wanna kill the senator today?"
549,549,And you are like cool?
550,550,I was afraid he wanted receptive work.
551,551,"Instead, he offered me $150,000 to kill the senator."
552,552,That's a lot of money.
553,553,So that's why you did it?
554,554,For the money.
555,555,"Look, Machete."
556,556,You're not legal in this country.
557,557,And after what happened in Mexico there is no way you're going home.
558,558,"So basically, you're a man with no country."
559,559,And lucky for you. I can help you out.
560,560,Look at me.
561,561,I can get you papers.
562,562,But you've got to let me bring you in.
563,563,I'm gonna find the guy who did this.
564,564,And bring him to you.
565,565,Why should I trust you?
566,566,Because we are both cops.
567,567,"I'd tell you to stop, but I know you took the bullets."
568,568,Luz!
569,569,Luz!
570,570,You wouldn't think they'll take me down that easily did ya?
571,571,You're alive.
572,572,But your house man!
573,573,It was small...
574,574,"I've got something to show you guys, come on..."
575,575,Told you they were gunning for us.
576,576,Who knows what they'll gonna do next.
577,577,"Holy shit, Luz!"
578,578,I didn't now that you were this loaded.
579,579,You got more heat than the police.
580,580,"It's a good start, but we need a lot more."
581,581,Need it for what?
582,582,The revolution.
583,583,Van and his men are coming for us.
584,584,We need to be ready.
585,585,I'm not gonna be around forever.
586,586,"If anything happens, you need to tell Machete the people need him."
587,587,Who exactly is this Machete?
588,588,That's him...
589,589,he's the one.
590,590,Hands up!
591,591,Against the wall.
592,592,"All of you, move it!"
593,593,Where's Machete?
594,594,Shit. She knows. Man!
595,595,Amigo's gonna deport our ass back.
596,596,Nobodies deporting anybody.
597,597,Machete already told me you guys weren't involved in the shooting.
598,598,Although... I should probably check the carnitas...
599,599,For lead!
600,600,What is this place anyway?
601,601,Welcome to The Network.
602,602,These are some of the people that I've help.
603,603,"Help them cross, Got them jobs, then make sure that they do their part."
604,604,And this?
605,605,These are the guys trying to stop us.
606,606,Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.
607,607,They started off with a couple of deer rifles and a warped sense of justice.
608,608,Then in the last year they've grown.
609,609,"More guns, more men."
610,610,Who's funding them?
611,611,"Whoever it is, is making a mess of our operation."
612,612,And these?
613,613,Missing They are supposed to have crossed.
614,614,But I have no way to track them.
615,615,How deep does your operation go?
616,616,Deep.
617,617,"All types, all races."
618,618,"Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys..."
619,619,"That's why they call it ""The Network""."
620,620,The way we see it.
621,621,People risk everything to get here.
622,622,The system doesn't work.
623,623,It's broken.
624,624,So we created our own.
625,625,You gonna burn us? huh?
626,626,Turn us all in?
627,627,no I'm gonna walk away and pretend I didn't see any of this.
628,628,Tell Machete I'm looking for him!
629,629,"I am a man of faith, I took a vow of peace."
630,630,And I don't shoot anymore.
631,631,And you don't shoot any less either.
632,632,"I don't see you or heard from you in three years, And now you want me to help you kill all these men?"
633,633,"Yes, brother..."
634,634,"I mean, father."
635,635,I'll see what I can do.
636,636,I want you to say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys.
637,637,Light a candle for mom...
638,638,For funerals.
639,639,A little side business.
640,640,I have these installed when too many things started walking away from the altar and collection plates.
641,641,Imagine if we have these kinda setup for all the Federales.
642,642,This is how you get the bad guys now.
643,643,You catch them on video.
644,644,Cuban?
645,645,Mexican.
646,646,"Yeah, I got some of that."
647,647,I've got something I want you to see Rest assure he will be caught.
648,648,It is the first shot of the war that...
649,649,we didn't ask for.
650,650,Nice way to find out your brother's in town.
651,651,Right there.
652,652,That's the guy that hired me.
653,653,Michael Booth?
654,654,He's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.
655,655,You know him?
656,656,Yeah... he comes in for confession all the time.
657,657,Lots of impure thoughts.
658,658,Mostly about his daughter.
659,659,I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink.
660,660,Here's his file.
661,661,Once he started talking about his connection to the cartels.
662,662,I figured. It'll come in handy.
663,663,"I bet McLaughlin doesn't even know that most of Booth's, business are just a front for his drug trade."
664,664,What I don't understand is why he hired you to kill his own boss.
665,665,Don't know.
666,666,Gonna find out.
667,667,It's not safe for you to be here.
668,668,Not looking for safe.
669,669,No I mean it's not safe for me for YOU to be here.
670,670,"I absolve you of all your sins, Now get the fuck out!"
671,671,"Okay, bro..."
672,672,But I'm borrowing your car.
673,673,"Why are you complaining about a weak neck, I'd said you should fucking do some situps."
674,674,"Hey... hey, hey boss?"
675,675,Who're you?
676,676,The new gardener Gardener?
677,677,"I'm just fucking with you, chief."
678,678,"It's Hungarian, it means that I'll kill you, you little monkey."
679,679,You know what?
680,680,There is a large pile shit in the back.
681,681,Make sure you do a good job.
682,682,Make sure you wipe those boots off!
683,683,He's carrying shit in the house.
684,684,Did you ever notice that you let go Mexicans into your home...
685,685,just because he's got gardening tools?
686,686,"I mean, no questions asked."
687,687,You just let him right in.
688,688,He could have a chainsaw or a machete...
689,689,God! Jesus!
690,690,Stop it!
691,691,"Dammit, that hurts!"
692,692,"If your father ever saw me, 2 minutes."
693,693,"Mom, everyone is gonna see you do this."
694,694,it's the Internet.
695,695,This is what my viewers wanna see online.
696,696,Hey! You not the usual guy.
697,697,He looks good to me.
698,698,"Oh don't be shy, come on in!"
699,699,Access denied.
700,700,What the fuck did you bring them here for?
701,701,Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?
702,702,Want me to dump them?
703,703,What? No... no.
704,704,I would make good use of them.
705,705,The Church can always use good people.
706,706,June?
707,707,April?
708,708,Where's my wife and daughter?
709,709,Woah... one family at a time.
710,710,It's Osiris...
711,711,Machete has a brother..
712,712,"or should I say, father."
713,713,State Senator John McLaughlin took a vow to defend the Constitution of this State.
714,714,Now!
715,715,he's taken a bullet for us.
716,716,And this is that bullet.
717,717,Vote to reelect Sen. John McLaughlin.
718,718,I'm John McLaughlin and I approve of this message.
719,719,Paid for by the Committee to reelect of John McLaughlin.
720,720,Sorry ma'am.
721,721,Damn new phone.
722,722,Should put on the vibrator.
723,723,Can you help me do that?
724,724,Pervert.
725,725,Yeah?
726,726,Senator?
727,727,It's Van.
728,728,I hear you got a problem maybe we can fix.
729,729,Don't call me on this line again.
730,730,I'll call you.
731,731,Now you said it yourself Senator war has begun.
732,732,Helter Skelter is here.
733,733,Your army awaits further orders.
734,734,Got to be respectful now.
735,735,No shit slaves.
736,736,What about the shooter?
737,737,He's still out there?
738,738,"There's nothing I'd like more, then to see that Mexican dance the bolero with the end of the rope."
739,739,He's gone underground for sure.
740,740,Let's say we go underground.
741,741,And get him.
742,742,You find the Network and you find the shooter.
743,743,Call our special friend.
744,744,Tell him we're gonna need a helluva more firepower.
745,745,If he is serious about wanting that border shut down.
746,746,Fix your damn gun.
747,747,Thanks.
748,748,Our friend is up.
749,749,Where the fuck have you been?
750,750,You could at least texted me.
751,751,Machete don't text.
752,752,But Machete get evidence.
753,753,Thanks for coming back.
754,754,"There is no way that McLaughlin is getting elected, unless something big happens."
755,755,"Can you imagine if someone shot the senator, and that someone was a Mexican."
756,756,The public would elect him to be president.
757,757,It's not a sin if someone clinch the senator in the leg is it?
758,758,"So, this is footage from your brother's confession?"
759,759,There's no open commandant against thou shall not wing a man.
760,760,Is there Padre?
761,761,But these files over here.
762,762,You got from Booth's office.
763,763,They're encrypted.
764,764,Is my little girl April... I spent nights...
765,765,Denied.
766,766,"You not going to think it's that easy, Do you?"
767,767,I just wish that April saw me as more a real man.
768,768,Holy shit...
769,769,You're right. The Network is not behind it.
770,770,This is something. A helluva lot bigger.
771,771,You've got enough here to bring down everyone.
772,772,"The Senator, Booth..."
773,773,Van...
774,774,Look here.
775,775,There's drug money financing the Senator's campaign.
776,776,Rogelio Torrez.
777,777,Torrez...
778,778,He's the drug kingpin who's been trying to gain control of the drug trade.
779,779,this must be the border fence McLaughlin wants to build.
780,780,See this?
781,781,These markings show the weakest spots.
782,782,It all makes sense now.
783,783,"Torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin reelected, so that he can build a border fence that he can control."
784,784,You did good work Machete.
785,785,I bet you're a great cop.
786,786,The best.
787,787,And modest too.
788,788,I'm dry.
789,789,Get up.
790,790,Why?
791,791,Because you're drunk.
792,792,Come be with me.
793,793,Speak English?
794,794,Depends on the question.
795,795,We know that you hired that Mexican to kill our senator.
796,796,"You're the Network, ain't ya?"
797,797,Hell! You're behind everything.
798,798,That's not how we work.
799,799,But if you want war...
800,800,I will give it to you.
801,801,How about an eye for an eye?
802,802,You burned your last burrito.
803,803,"You got to get better at this, Billy."
804,804,"Please, Father, have mercy."
805,805,"God has mercy, I don't Hello father."
806,806,The Blood of Christ?
807,807,Taste like Merlot to me.
808,808,Where is he?
809,809,He's everywhere.
810,810,Talk Padre.
811,811,Sing me one of those Mexican hymns like a chroming arch boy.
812,812,Go to hell.
813,813,You want to be a martyr?
814,814,I'm good at making martyrs.
815,815,Like Senator McLaughlin?
816,816,That's right.
817,817,We have to get that Senator reelected.
818,818,Get that fence built along the border.
819,819,before it is too late.
820,820,You really hate our kind that much?
821,821,"No padre, I hate declining profits that much."
822,822,An open border allows supply of flowing too easily.
823,823,Drives our prices down.
824,824,Restricted border limits supply.
825,825,Drives the prices up.
826,826,"Higher price, higher profits."
827,827,"You are drunk with power, even putting the hit on your own boss."
828,828,Just to boost his election numbers.
829,829,"Last chance, amigo."
830,830,Where's Machete and where are my wife and daughter?
831,831,In hell.
832,832,Then give them my best.
833,833,A real gentleman.
834,834,Comfortable...
835,835,Are they the same?
836,836,They want you dead too.
837,837,My brother.
838,838,Wait!
839,839,How do you text with this thing?
840,840,I thought Machete don't text.
841,841,Machete improvise.
842,842,Where're you going?
843,843,Take out the trash.
844,844,"Machete, sent me a text."
845,845,What's it say?
846,846,You just fuck with the wrong Mexican.
847,847,He's coming after us.
848,848,"No, he's coming after you."
849,849,You got some news?
850,850,Yes.
851,851,His brother's is dead.
852,852,You killed a priest.
853,853,Congratulations.
854,854,"That's right Booth, I'm in your town."
855,855,And I'm gonna kill Machete.
856,856,And you're gonna watch it happen.
857,857,And it will be the last you see.
858,858,Wait a second.
859,859,There's a girl from ICE.
860,860,"She's with Machete and they have a file on me, on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody."
861,861,She can make things very difficult for us.
862,862,Where is she?
863,863,"You know, I've been thinking."
864,864,"We let these people into our homes, Watch our kids, park our cars."
865,865,"But we won't let them, into our country."
866,866,Does that make any sense to you?
867,867,Hey! That wetback whack the both of us over the head.
868,868,"In case you forgot, he shot me in the leg."
869,869,I thought Jango shot you?
870,870,I don't want to hear that story again.
871,871,Think about it.
872,872,He wasn't here for us.
873,873,He's here for the boss.
874,874,I've been watching the boss. This guy is a real scumbag.
875,875,"Hey, hey, hey."
876,876,Where's your loyalty at?
877,877,Did you hear that?
878,878,It's weed whacker.
879,879,He's back!
880,880,Spread out.
881,881,Spread out NOW!
882,882,"Alpha unit, you copy?"
883,883,Quit!

885,885,You hear me?
886,886,Anybody?
887,887,Where's Booth?
888,888,"The senator, his with the senator."
889,889,I have a GPS.
890,890,Tracks his limo.
891,891,"Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it."
892,892,"That's Spanish, ""I let you live. "" Thanks Chief Let me see if I am hearing you right."
893,893,One of the city's most prominent businessmen.
894,894,A Texas vigilante.
895,895,"The most notorious drug kingpin of Mexico and a state senator, are all conspiring to enact stricter immigration laws?"
896,896,"I know how it sounds, but I have Booth on video committing a murder."
897,897,I have tons of confessions.
898,898,I mean it's...
899,899,"Listen to yourself, this man is an illegal alien, ILLEGAL as in against the law."
900,900,"Well, there's the law and there's what's right."
901,901,I'm gonna do what's right.
902,902,We are live from the Church of Hope where just moments ago.
903,903,Police discovered a gruesome murder.
904,904,The body of a priest was found nailed to the cross.
905,905,And witnesses descriptions of a man leaving the church.
906,906,Match those of a gunman wanted for the shooting of Senator McLaughlin.
907,907,"Excuse me, honey's just shut the door and give us a moment."
908,908,"On the street, they call him Machete."
909,909,"Who is he, what is he?"
910,910,And will he ever be brought down?
911,911,Where the fuck have you been?
912,912,This story is burning the whole fucking town to the ground.
913,913,It's giving us a war that I know we can win!
914,914,"He's a cockroach, sooner or later he'll be squashed."
915,915,"Oh, oh, yeah!"
916,916,"Well, this roach has got AK47's and he's laying waste to everything that gets in his fucking path."
917,917,I'm taking care of it.
918,918,They scheduled me for release in a couple of minutes...
919,919,I can't walk outta here like a fucking piñata waiting to get whacked.
920,920,The man they are calling Machete...
921,921, We're ready for you Senator.
922,922,It's show time...
923,923,"You forgot your cane, sir."
924,924,"Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John McLaughlin."
925,925,"Thank you, thank you."
926,926,This Frito Bandito is not any closer to justice.
927,927,"I urge this criminal and those that are hiding him, to turn him in."
928,928,"He's destroying us from the inside, like the plague that he is..."
929,929,We must not let terrorist win.
930,930,Senator?
931,931,"There are reports implicating, your advisors as having orchestrating the assassination attempt."
932,932,Would you care to comment?
933,933,What now?
934,934,Want to be a martyr?
935,935,I am good at making martyrs.
936,936,Like Senator McLaughlin?
937,937,That's right.
938,938,We have to get that Senator reelected.
939,939,Get that fence built along the border.
940,940,Before it's too late.
941,941,"Or do you care to comment, on the shooting. That happened on the border on the night of July 22nd?"
942,942,Who is gonna stop us?
943,943,I am!
944,944,Welcome to the America.
945,945,You catch all that?
946,946,Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters are going to like that!
947,947,A lot!
948,948,How about your connections with drug king pin Rogelio Torrez?
949,949,No further comment.
950,950,"I'm sorry, I just..."
951,951,Or the border vigilantes involved in running drugs?
952,952,I think I'm having a heart attack.
953,953,God dammit if you don't relax you will have one.
954,954,"You jeopardize more than my career, We got cut back."
955,955,He could have killed me.
956,956,Not with that scope.
957,957,You stupid son of a bitch...
958,958,You pulled something like that without consulting me?
959,959,Who the fuck do you think you are?!
960,960,I'm the one who got your campaign financed.
961,961,Made you a political powerhouse.
962,962,Your own personal Jesus.
963,963,"So, you better get down on your knees, and start praying for me to save your soul Because I'm the only one who can at this point!"
964,964,Get the fuck out.
965,965,"God dammit man, why don't you just die?"
966,966,It's gonna work.
967,967,We could have been rich.
968,968,Torrez.
969,969,Was stopping all those cheap shit from across the border.
970,970,Can lead more than a tired fool with a dime bag and a dream.
971,971,So we financed Van.
972,972,Giving the men guns.
973,973,The Vigilantes.
974,974,Our own little private border patrol.
975,975,But Torrez wanted the whole enchilada.
976,976,So I thought why not let politics do what guns couldn't.
977,977,Funny things is that I thought it would be a peaceful solution.
978,978,None of that tortured taco.
979,979,"Wait, wait..."
980,980,Torrez is looking for you.
981,981,"You find Van, you'll find Torrez."
982,982,Please...
983,983,Tell me...
984,984,where are my wife and daughter?
985,985,With God.
986,986,I guess I won't be seeing them.
987,987,Fuck! My head...
988,988,What is this shit?
989,989,That asshole drugged us.
990,990,Where are our clothes?
991,991,Call daddy.
992,992,"It's June, and April."
993,993,We're very sorry.
994,994,Your husband is dead.
995,995,He's what?
996,996,Senator McLaughlin shot him.
997,997,Secure that weapon!
998,998,Yeah!
999,999,"Vigilante leader, Van Jackson has refused declined comment, after startling revelations of their connections, to the Mexican drug cartels."
1000,1000,This is Van...
1001,1001,I'm coming in.
1002,1002,We're all over the news senator...
1003,1003,You compromised everything we worked for.
1004,1004,There is only one way this is gonna end.
1005,1005,smoke em' out.
1006,1006,But I wanna put a bullet in his head myself.
1007,1007,And just how you're figuring on doing that?
1008,1008,I'm joining you boys for one last ride along.
1009,1009,Machete.
1010,1010,Where's Luz?
1011,1011,"She's gone, man."
1012,1012,Vigilante's got her.
1013,1013,And now they're after you.
1014,1014,"You gotta lead us to fight, it's what Luz would have want!"
1015,1015,Not your war.
1016,1016,I may be adopted...
1017,1017,No shit.
1018,1018,But what's going on is not right!
1019,1019,"We just wanna help, bro."
1020,1020,I don't need your help.
1021,1021,Not us?
1022,1022,Then who?
1023,1023,Whatever you need.
1024,1024,"Build it, strip it, chop it."
1025,1025,"Garage's is yours, Homez..."
1026,1026,Got guns?
1027,1027,Yes.
1028,1028,"We missiles, machine guns."
1029,1029,"We fight Van, we fight Torrez."
1030,1030,We take em' all down at once.
1031,1031,Hey everyone!
1032,1032,Listen UP!
1033,1033,Now we got some work to do!
1034,1034,Does anyone knows who's Machete?
1035,1035,Does anyone knows who's Machete?
1036,1036,Please.
1037,1037,"Machete needs your help or he'll be killed just like Luz, just like father."
1038,1038,Listen to me!
1039,1039,"Yes, I am a woman of the law, and there are lots of laws!"
1040,1040,"But if they don't offer us justice, Then they aren't law!"
1041,1041,They are just lines drawn in the sand by men who would stand on your backs.
1042,1042,For power and glory.
1043,1043,Men who deserves to be cut down.
1044,1044,It's time to erase the line!
1045,1045,And show these bastards the true meaning of true law!
1046,1046,We didn't cross the border.
1047,1047,The border crossed us!
1048,1048,Long live Machete!
1049,1049,Long live Machete!
1050,1050,Youre Machete's girl.
1051,1051,I know.
1052,1052,Unless you're his type.
1053,1053,What type is that?
1054,1054,Dead.
1055,1055,"Earlier today, Senator McLaughlin allegedly pulled a gun, on his advisor Michael Booth."
1056,1056,And shot him twice in the chest.
1057,1057,After an altercation following the disaster reveal earlier this afternoon. Of the senator's connections to the Mexican drug king pin Rogelio Torrez.
1058,1058,Network!
1059,1059,"According to recent reports, McLaughlin's reelection campaign was been funded entirely by Mr. Torrez."
1060,1060,Machete!
1061,1061,Networks said the senator calling the vigilantes to kill you.
1062,1062,"And Agent Santana, she's been captured by Torrez!"
1063,1063,All hands and the armory to load up.
1064,1064,Time to roll out!
1065,1065,Give me a vest and a rifle.
1066,1066,My great grand daddy...
1067,1067,did not give his life at at The Alamo so that we could sell off our nation to some backstabbing politicians.
1068,1068,What are you talking about?
1069,1069,"You lied to us, you paid that Mexican to put on an act."
1070,1070,To fool the people.
1071,1071,And my pool of posse.
1072,1072,Now he's on his way...
1073,1073,And no doubt bringing a whole mess of bean eaters.
1074,1074,"You seem to be quite fond of Booth, Senator."
1075,1075,You've been in the desert too long amigo...
1076,1076,Well let's see just how this blows your skirt up?
1077,1077,We're gonna simulcast your execution for the crime of treason.

1084,1084,Hold the line...
1085,1085,I have desecrated the oath of our first...

1095,1095,How is your eye?
1096,1096,What eye?
1097,1097,"If you want to survive your own war, you better become Mexican real fast."
1098,1098,"You got enemies on all sides, Senator."
1099,1099,Who can you trust?
1100,1100,You aim to take down those boys?
1101,1101,Then I'm with you.
1102,1102,Take out that Mexican!
1103,1103,God Dammit!
1104,1104,"Van, we're fucked! We gotta get outta here."
1105,1105,Get outta here!
1106,1106,Sister...

1109,1109,I've done terrible this life...
1110,1110,And I'm not even from here I hate Texas.
1111,1111,I hate the heat.
1112,1112,Give me my last rites.
1113,1113,In the name of my father.
1114,1114,My father...
1115,1115,April.
1116,1116,Forgot the rest.
1117,1117,You never learn to stay down!
1118,1118,Jerkoff.
1119,1119,So I guess I have to teach you.
1120,1120,Got something to say?
1121,1121,Now you got something to say?
1122,1122,Back the fuck up and watch.
1123,1123,Okay jerkoff!
1124,1124,Forward.
1125,1125,We used to be Federales together.
1126,1126,Remember?
1127,1127,We were brothers...
1128,1128,But you?
1129,1129,Went for the honor.
1130,1130,Idiot.
1131,1131,Then I went for the power.
1132,1132,We killed a lot of bad guys together.
1133,1133,Now I'm the bad guy.
1134,1134,What do you wanna do?
1135,1135,Little brother?
1136,1136,"Look at your Machete now, asshole."
1137,1137,He's gonna kill him.
1138,1138,No he's not.
1139,1139,He's Machete.
1140,1140,No point.
1141,1141,Fuck.
1142,1142,You know I could kill you now very easily.
1143,1143,Believe me.
1144,1144,This is nothing.
1145,1145,This ain't shit.
1146,1146,But...
1147,1147,I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.
1148,1148,So...
