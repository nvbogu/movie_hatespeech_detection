1,1,"Please, let go!"
2,2,Please!
3,3,Please!
4,4,"Please, please, please, please don't do this."
5,5,Please!
6,6,No!
7,7,"Please, don't!"
8,8,"No, no, please (screams)."
9,9,"No, no!"
10,10,"The gray wolf is a rare sight to see in the wild, their numbers are decreasing, but it is still one of the most elegant predators in the world."
11,11,"As a predator, the gray wolf is known for its unmatched ferocity."
12,12,"In seconds, the wolf can go from a calm state to a vicious beast, it won't rest until it's overcome its opponent."
13,13,"How you doin', bud?"
14,14,(breathes heavily) Like a million bucks.
15,15,Where's Mom and Reese?
16,16,"They went home a few hours ago, they wanted to be here when you woke up, but Mom had an appointment this morning."
17,17,"Morning, Kyle."
18,18,Glad to see you're awake.
19,19,"How's he doing, doc?"
20,20,"Well, let's find out."
21,21,Everything's as we expected.
22,22,So how long do I have to be in here?
23,23,"We still have to run a few tests, so we'll have to wait and see."
24,24,"I'm sorry, I wish I had better news to give you."
25,25,"(sighs) Yeah, me too."
26,26,I wanna get out of here for a while.
27,27,"Kyle, are you gonna be okay?"
28,28,"I'll be all right, tell everyone I was okay."
29,29,I'll walk you out.
30,30,I take it you got my message?
31,31,Yeah.
32,32,Your wife?
33,33,I thought it best that I knew what was going on before I told her.
34,34,All right.
35,35,"We've been able to make some progress, but it's still getting worse."
36,36,What are our options?
37,37,(sighs) That's what I wanted to talk to you and your wife about.
38,38,Kyle is past the point of traditional treatments.
39,39,"There is, however, an experimental drug we can try."
40,40,So what's the catch?
41,41,Your insurance.
42,42,Insurance?
43,43,They're gonna cover this.
44,44,I'm sorry.
45,45,You're gonna tell me where you got this right now.
46,46,"Mom, don't worry about it."
47,47,What's going on?
48,48,Look at what I found in Reese's room.
49,49,"Reese, you tell me where you got this right now."
50,50,"I, I've been saving it up."
51,51,Don't lie to me.
52,52,"You stole it, didn't you?"
53,53,"No, Mom, I didn't steal it."
54,54,Then how did you get this much money?
55,55,"Don't look at your dad for help, just answer the question."
56,56,"Kate, I gave him the money, okay?"
57,57,What?
58,58,He said he needed it.
59,59,I gave it to him.
60,60,"You really don't take anything seriously, do you?"
61,61,"Oh, look, Kate."
62,62,"I'm sorry, Dad."
63,63,You can take the money back.
64,64,"No, that's okay, you're keeping that money."
65,65,Kate.
66,66,Kate.
67,67,"Look, I know I should've (Kate sighs) told you about the money."
68,68,You shouldn't have gave it to him in the first place.
69,69,"Dean, what were you thinking?"
70,70,That our son deserves to have a little extra.
71,71,You know we never do.
72,72,I had a little extra cash.
73,73,"No, he wanted it, he didn't need it."
74,74,Do you have any idea what he's gonna spend that much money on?
75,75,No.
76,76,"Kyle is in the hospital, we can barely afford to put food on our table, and you just give away money like that?"
77,77,I had a little extra.
78,78,There is no such thing as extra for us right now.
79,79,You can't give away money that we don't have.
80,80,"If you do have extra money, that goes to stuff we need around here."
81,81,You're gonna take it all back.
82,82,Why are you being such a...
83,83,"What, a bitch?"
84,84,I didn't say that.
85,85,"Well, I am a bitch."
86,86,"And let me tell you something, I have to be a bitch to keep this family together."
87,87,"You think I wanted to raise my kids this way, having to fight and scrounge for every last dollar?"
88,88,"And in the face of it all we can be thrown out on the street, I find out my husband isn't supporting me or this family."
89,89,I'm doing the best I can to support us!
90,90,Clearly you're doing the best you can!
91,91,You know this is gonna crush him.
92,92,I know.
93,93,I didn't say he didn't deserve it.
94,94,We just cannot afford it right now.
95,95,We're still a couple hundred dollars short this month.
96,96,"If you give me that, you can get him whatever you want."
97,97,Reese.
98,98,I'm gonna have to hold on to that money.
99,99,Knew Mom would screw this up!
100,100,Reese!
101,101,Come out!
102,102,How's it goin' man?
103,103,So what you got for me?
104,104,So I have a helmet.
105,105,All right.
106,106,Let's check it out.
107,107,"Yeah, it's in good condition, I mean."
108,108,Yeah.
109,109,I'll give you 150 for it.
110,110,Really?
111,111,Yeah.
112,112,This is an authentic army helmet.
113,113,"Yeah, where'd you get it?"
114,114,It was my brother's.
115,115,"Okay, did he ever make it overseas?"
116,116,They all go overseas at some point.
117,117,"Yeah, did he make it back?"
118,118,I need $300 for the helmet.
119,119,"Yeah, uh, listen man, do you know of any army surplus stores around here?"
120,120,No.
121,121,"All right then, that makes the buyer's market, I'm the buyer, I'm saying you're only gettin' 150 for this."
122,122,"All right, Dean, Charlie's on vacation this week, so I want you to work the game tonight."
123,123,"Now they've got the entire service themselves, you know the rules, don't speak unless spoken to, and don't make eye contact."
124,124,You got it?
125,125,"You better, Dean."
126,126,"I shouldn't have to tell you this, but if you screw up out there, you're gone."
127,127,"So, I'm at the office today, fired us some prick."
128,128,He's not going down without a fight.
129,129,Nice.
130,130,"So did he scream, or just yell?"
131,131,"No, he was kinda weird about it."
132,132,"I called him into the office, break the news, and he's just standing there, not saying a damn thing, like a statue."
133,133,So what you do next?
134,134,"Well, the guy goes the leave and he turns to me and asks me how I sleep at night."
135,135,"I said, look, I'm runnin' a business here, I'm not a charity."
136,136,"I bet he didn't like that, did he?"
137,137,"No, (chuckles), he didn't."
138,138,"So I said, look, you did a good job here, but the economy is not what it used to be."
139,139,"Then he has the nerve to talk to me about how much I'm makin', in my own damn (chuckles) company."
140,140,"I give him a little bit of free advice, I said, look, nobody's gonna take care you but yourself, it don't matter if you're making a mil a year or six bucks an hour."
141,141,Gotta do what you gotta do to survive.
142,142,"Have a good night, Dean."
143,143,Price is 200.
144,144,I just sold this to you for 150 earlier today.
145,145,"Yeah, you sold it to me, you didn't pawn it, and that means that I say the price to get it back is 200."
146,146,"This is the last thing I have of my brother's, he died in Iraq, 2008."
147,147,It's touching.
148,148,Price is still 200.
149,149,Fine.
150,150,Keep it.
151,151,"Reese, Reese."
152,152," (calm sad piano music)  Yeah, Dad?"
153,153,"Hey, bud."
154,154,Got this back for ya.
155,155,But what about Mom?
156,156,Just don't let her catch you.
157,157,Okay.
158,158,Okay?
159,159,"You know she loves you, right?"
160,160,I know.
161,161,Okay.
162,162,Sleep tight.
163,163,Hey.
164,164,Got some money.
165,165,"Yeah, I'll just leave it over to my window."
166,166,Cool.
167,167,Where'd you get all this money?
168,168,Work.
169,169,How'd you get this much from work?
170,170,You really wanna fight about something else?
171,171,"No, I don't wanna fight at all, I just, I just wanna know what we're doing here."
172,172,Taking it day by day.
173,173,Like we always have.
174,174,"You can see where that's gotten us, Dean."
175,175,I don't want our kids to grow up in trailers for the rest of their lives.
176,176,"Look, I don't want our kids to grow up in trailers either, but I'm doing the best I can."
177,177,Are you?
178,178,Are you really doing the best you can?
179,179,Well what exactly is it that you've been doing?
180,180,What?
181,181,Do you think there's jobs out there that'll pay good money for a guy like me?
182,182,"I've looked, there's nothing there."
183,183,"Well, I'll just add up to the list of things that you can't do."
184,184,Just stop!
185,185,"Getting fired from your last job, working in a bar, washing out of the army."
186,186, (glass breaks)  Shut the hell up!
187,187,I'm tired of you always starting the shit!
188,188,Fine!
189,189,"I went to the army and washed out, I couldn't even make it through basic boot camp."
190,190,I'm a loser!
191,191,I'm a piece of shit loser!
192,192,"That's what you wanted to hear, right?"
193,193,"Oh, oh Reese, oh God!"
194,194,Let me see.
195,195,"Oh, you're gonna need stitches, come here, come here, let's go."
196,196,Let's get your shoes.
197,197,Should go in here.
198,198,You can't leave.
199,199,Yeah.
200,200,Aw.
201,201," (calm music)  Check it out, bro."
202,202,"Woah, bet there was a lot of blood."
203,203,"Yeah, I did get 15 stitches."
204,204,"Didn't cry, did ya?"
205,205,Of course not.
206,206,"Hey, I have something for you."
207,207,What?
208,208,"Oh, thanks bro, where'd you get it?"
209,209,From one of the kids down the street.
210,210,I finally had enough money for it.
211,211,Where'd you get the money for it?
212,212,I have my tricks.
213,213,Dad?
214,214,Yeah.
215,215,Just don't tell him.
216,216,Okay.
217,217,"Hey, so where's Dad?"
218,218,"Well, he's back at the house."
219,219,Will he be coming tonight?
220,220,"Um, I don't think so."
221,221,I'm sorry that I hurt my foot.
222,222,"Hey, you know that we can't afford this kind of stuff?"
223,223,Hey!
224,224,"Hey, don't talk like that."
225,225,It's not your fault.
226,226,It's nobody's fault.
227,227,Just life sometimes and it does not mean that I don't love you or your dad.
228,228,It just means you need to try a little harder.
229,229,"Everything is gonna be okay, I promise."
230,230,"So, is that what the money was for?"
231,231,"If you want, I'll just give it right back."
232,232,No way!
233,233,Got any songs on it yet?
234,234,"No, not yet."
235,235,I think that we can download some for free on the Internet.
236,236,"Cool, what are we gonna download first?"
237,237,"I don't know, let's find out."
238,238,"Yeah, I'm seeing some old ones."
239,239,Nice.
240,240,"Old, hey, what do you mean, old?"
241,241,"Ah, oh, I mean the ones that were, you listened to."
242,242,"Thanks, yeah! (Reese laughs) I'm just joking, Mom."
243,243,"Good morning, Dad."
244,244, Okay.
245,245," Hi, bud."
246,246,Good night.
247,247,Hey.
248,248,Hi.
249,249,I'm sorry about...
250,250,"No, look, me too."
251,251,"Kate, I have something I need to tell you."
252,252,"What is it, Dean?"
253,253,"Apparently the insurance for Kyle's medical bills are just, they're not gonna cover him anymore."
254,254,They're all gonna fall on us.
255,255,What do you mean?
256,256,We can't afford that.
257,257,They have to cover him!
258,258,"I'm not sure, but we're gonna figure this out."
259,259,"Look, I will do whatever it takes, we're not gonna let our son die."
260,260,I don't know what to do.
261,261,"Kate, look, Kate, look, I love you, I have always loved you, I'm not gonna let this tear our family apart."
262,262,"(Kate sobs) Just have faith and believe, and we will get through this."
263,263,Okay?
264,264,"I love you, Kate."
265,265,"I love you, too."
266,266,"Been a long night, guys."
267,267,I'm all in.
268,268,"Well, I'm out."
269,269,"I'll call you on it, see what you got."
270,270,Dean.
271,271,You need to empty your pockets for me.
272,272,Get in the car.
273,273,No.
274,274,Wasn't a question.
275,275,Come with me.
276,276,He doesn't like to be kept waiting.
277,277,Drink?
278,278,I like to make my guests their drink personal.
279,279,So what's it gonna be?
280,280,You the guy that busted me at the bar?
281,281,Didn't take a bunch of rich pricks to notice you've taken a few hundred dollars are down in the (mumbles).
282,282,"Name is Sam, by the way."
283,283,You're Dean.
284,284,How'd you know my name?
285,285,I know everything about you.
286,286,"Wasn't hard to figure out, really."
287,287,"Now Dean, don't make me ask again."
288,288,I'm good.
289,289,What's the best drink you've ever had in life?
290,290,"Really, I'm fine."
291,291,"Tell you what, give you something I know you've never had before."
292,292,It's called Louis XIII (drink splashes in glass).
293,293,"(glass thuds on table) Bet you never even heard of this stuff before, haven't you?"
294,294,No.
295,295,Didn't think so (drink splashes in glass).
296,296,This glass here (glass thuds on table) probably cost more than you make in a month.
297,297,"This bottle alone, 75,013."
298,298,Damn good stuff.
299,299,"Wouldn't want to waste a drink from a $13,000 bottle, would you?"
300,300,"Tell me, Dean, why are you here?"
301,301,You tell me.
302,302,I think you know exactly why you're here.
303,303,"Well, at first I thought you brought me here to kill me."
304,304,(chuckles) Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.
305,305,Have a couple of questions for you.
306,306,Why'd you do it?
307,307,I don't owe you anything.
308,308,"No, I think you do."
309,309,"Well if you have me so figured out, it should be easy."
310,310,"A sick kid in the hospital, another kid and a wife at home, in this economy."
311,311,Hear that.
312,312,This nation's been hurting.
313,313,Lord knows I had to cut back.
314,314,"I could sense it in you the first time I saw you, could see the desperation."
315,315,"See, I like a desperate man."
316,316,"Most men are predictable, but the desperate man, you never can tell how he's gonna act."
317,317,"Well, it's not like I have piles of money laying around like some people."
318,318,I have real life problems to deal with.
319,319,"There's nothing special about you or your problems, Dean."
320,320,"Well if there's nothing special about me, I guess I'll be on my way."
321,321,I brought in (glass thuds on table) for a reason.
322,322,Like to offer you a job.
323,323,What kind of a job?
324,324,More of an opportunity.
325,325,Sit back down.
326,326,"See, I belong to a select group of people, I've traveled all over the world, I've hunted some of the most exotic animals in existence."
327,327,"My offer to you is as follows, I'll take you into the wilderness for seven days, from the first sunrise to the last sunset, I will hunt you."
328,328,"You'll be permitted to defend yourself, but you won't receive any assistance."
329,329,"On the eighth day, I'll transfer one million dollars into the bank account of your choosing, whether you're alive or dead."
330,330,(sighs) You're sick.
331,331,"What, it's not enough to have all of this money, you've got to play God?"
332,332,Is that it?
333,333,"I'm just a hunter, trying to hunt the ultimate game."
334,334,I'm not gonna stick around to listen to this sickening speech anymore.
335,335,Think about it (Dean sighs).
336,336,I'm offering you enough money to change your life forever.
337,337,That's what I don't get about you people.
338,338,You get every opportunity in the world and you're just too stupid to take it.
339,339,"Go home, Dean, look at your kids, your wife, and know that no matter how hard you work, the best life that you're gonna be able to create for them is the same sad pathetic one you're living now."
340,340,You think about that.
341,341,I'll be seeing you soon!
342,342,Dean.
343,343,Take this card.
344,344,In case you change your mind.
345,345,The men outside will take you anywhere you wanna go.
346,346,He always gets what he wants.
347,347,Always.
348,348,Hey!
349,349,Hey!
350,350,Hey!
351,351,What the hell are you doing?
352,352,"Oh, what, like you didn't think I'd find out?"
353,353,"Kate, wait, look, I can fix this, you just have to give me some time."
354,354,"Dean, I don't care, I don't care where you've been all night and I don't care what you have to say."
355,355,I'm done!
356,356,"Kate, you can't do this to me, I can't lose you and the kids."
357,357,Please!
358,358,"Well, I can't keep being the only person who takes care of this family."
359,359,"Kate, give me a chance, I can make this right."
360,360,Please.
361,361,"Fine, but you better fix this, Dean, you better make it right, you better start taking care of this family, because if you don't, I will find someone who will (car engine rumbles)."
362,362,Kate.
363,363,What?
364,364,Should I get someone to interpret that for you?
365,365,"No, just one thing."
366,366,What is it?
367,367,I want cash.
368,368,Whatever works for you.
369,369,All right.
370,370,Welcome to the hunt (Dean sighs).
371,371,What?
372,372,You thought I was gonna be alone?
373,373,"A thing you have to remember about this hunt, I can use any means necessary to kill you."
374,374,"A few minutes before sunup, Dean."
375,375,I suggest you start running.
376,376,"All right, boys, I got him."
377,377,He's heading east towards the river.
378,378,"Making this too easy on us, Dean!"
379,379,"Right, go."
380,380,"Go find him, right?"
381,381,"Go find him, go on!"
382,382, What the hell happened here?
383,383, Quiet!
384,384,Damn (breathes heavily).
385,385,"Jason, come in."
386,386,(walkie talkie clicks) This is Jason.
387,387,We heard a shot.
388,388,Did you get him?
389,389,"Negative, he's heading east, I'm going after him."
390,390,(walkie talkie clicks) Copy that.
391,391,Found something you're gonna wanna check out first.
392,392,You think this is where they got in?
393,393,"Yeah, one probably came over to to that tree looking for food, and these grounds are empty."
394,394,The guards didn't stop him coming in?
395,395,"Its job to keep stuff from getting out, not from getting in."
396,396,What are we gonna do about it?
397,397,What you all so worried about?
398,398,This adds more fun to the game.
399,399,That's right.
400,400,Part of the hunt now.
401,401,All right.
402,402,Oh.
403,403,Damn.
404,404,Just missed him.
405,405,Couldn't gone too far.
406,406,Any sign of him?
407,407,"Nah, I looked all around, couldn't find any tracks."
408,408,You did?
409,409,Guess that means I've better check it out.
410,410,"What, you think I can't track?"
411,411,I know you can.
412,412,"Anyway, looks like we're getting close."
413,413,Got some food.
414,414,"Yeah, we shouldn't let that out."
415,415,"It's all right, I like 'em when they get a little food in 'em, makes 'em more fun to hunt."
416,416,"It's getting late, let's go and eat here."
417,417,"All right, I'm with Carl."
418,418,"So what are we doing tonight, steak or lobster?"
419,419,"We might've underestimated this one, Sam."
420,420,How so?
421,421,"We've been hunting this guy for two days, and he's still breathing."
422,422," (scary music)  Let me ask you something, besides this, what's the best animal to hunt?"
423,423,Best?
424,424,One should say most difficult.
425,425,"Land, it's a lion, not too long ago, (mumbles) weren't difficult."
426,426,"Rhino, believe it or not."
427,427,"They're easy enough to track down, but once they start to charge, they don't stop until it's over."
428,428,"Elephant, same with the rhino, they're easy enough to track down, but that's one smart animal."
429,429,What's the one thing those animals have in common?
430,430,"Desperation, the most dangerous time to approach an animal is when they're down, that's when they're the most desperate."
431,431,"You asked me why I chose this man, he lives in desperation, combine that with his military training, you have one hell of a hunter."
432,432,"Ah, is anyone home?"
433,433,I need help.
434,434,(bangs on door) Hello!
435,435,Hello?
436,436,(door creaks) Is anyone home?
437,437,I need help.
438,438,Hello?
439,439,Woo!
440,440,"Ah, let's go!"
441,441,"Come on, come on I got him!"
442,442,Come on!
443,443,Come on!
444,444,Come on!
445,445,Come on!
446,446,Hey!
447,447,Woo hoo!
448,448,I got him.
449,449,Please!
450,450, Hell yeah!
451,451, Let me go!
452,452, Please!
453,453, Nice shot!
454,454,"Don't, no!"
455,455,"Please, please!"
456,456,No!
457,457,No!
458,458,Okay!
459,459,Please!
460,460,Guys.
461,461,Why don't we just call somebody and have him taken out?
462,462,"We already have, they won't be here for a few days."
463,463,I'm not willing to wait that long.
464,464,"I'm saying no, it's going to be getting dark soon, we should eat first before we go out there."
465,465,"You two don't have the slightest clue of what's going on here, do you?"
466,466,"Dean has evidence, actual video evidence of what goes on out here."
467,467,So what?
468,468,He goes to the cops and the organization will take care of it.
469,469,"Oh, they'll take care of it."
470,470,Then they'll care of us.
471,471,"You know the rules, anything gets out, we're responsible."
472,472,So shut the hell up and get ready.
473,473,We're going now.
474,474,Stop!
475,475,Are you with them?
476,476,You gotta help me.
477,477,There's people in here trying to kill me.
478,478,Return to the hunting grounds.
479,479,Get back!
480,480,"Hunting party, come in (walkie talkie rings)."
481,481,"Hunting party, over."
482,482,(walkie talkie rings).
483,483,Think it's him?
484,484,Has to be.
485,485,"Think he tried to get through, they must've stopped him."
486,486,Right.
487,487,I think we should go back to the cabin.
488,488,We're huntin' through the night.
489,489,How the hell we're supposed to follow footprints at night?
490,490,"Guys, check this out."
491,491,Woo!
492,492,Woo!
493,493,"You find him, don't hesitate to shoot."
494,494,"Keep in mind, we need to bring him back alive."
495,495,Won't the guards get suspicious if we don't kill him?
496,496,"Oh, we're gonna kill him, all right, we gotta get those DVDs back first."
497,497,"Besides, they don't care, they're just here to keep the hunt going."
498,498,"All right (gun is cocked loudly), let's get this son of a bitch."
499,499,Help!
500,500,Son of a bitch!
501,501,âª I am I'm gonna kill you!
502,502,God damn head off!
503,503,"âª Every time you think you're gone âª Wake up âª Livin' Help, please."
504,504,I can get you out of this.
505,505,"âª So wake up âª Wake up âª People âª Have a twisted frame âª Every time defeat their pride âª And wake up Come on, Dean."
506,506,See you in the hunt.
507,507,âª Wake up âª Wake up Look.
508,508,Right by the guidance!
509,509,âª You'll have âª Trying to beat them âª Swallow their pets âª Like never fed âª It's all in your head âª It's all in your head Luke.
510,510,Luke?
511,511,Luke?
512,512,Did you get him?
513,513,No.
514,514,Jesus Christ.
515,515,You all right?
516,516,What do you think?
517,517,We were ambushed.
518,518,Where's your gun?
519,519,Shit.
520,520,You guys gotta kill this son of a bitch.
521,521,Don't worry about that.
522,522,It's only a matter of time.
523,523,So how'd he do this to you?
524,524,"Don't know, (breathes heavily) followed the trail of blood, I thought he was wounded."
525,525,"Good night, we'll go after him in the morning."
526,526,I'll call someone to pick you up tonight.
527,527,Let's get Tyler to the car.
528,528,Come on.
529,529,Shit.
530,530,Damn it!
531,531,"Sam, I found something."
532,532,Think it's a trap?
533,533,"Oh, I know it is."
534,534,But we don't have a choice.
535,535,We could just leave him.
536,536,Thomas?
537,537,Just let him die out here like Luke?
538,538,"Dean's got him, he's probably dead anyway."
539,539,"Either way, we still have to find Dean."
540,540,What's the plan?
541,541,He's hiding in the area somewhere.
542,542,What kind of weapons does he have left?
543,543,Not sure.
544,544,A few knives and at least one rifle.
545,545,Probably a few grenades.
546,546,All right.
547,547,"I'm gonna go into the cave, you keep watch out here."
548,548,I've got it.
549,549,If you see anything at all.
550,550,I'm not gonna let him bury you in there.
551,551,Thomas.
552,552,"Sam, I'm over here."
553,553,Where is he?
554,554,Don't know.
555,555,"Dragged me here last night, I didn't see anything since."
556,556,Jason?
557,557,"A second, don't leave me here."
558,558,Don't leave me here (sobs).
559,559,Jason?
560,560,Jason?
561,561,"What, were you just gonna leave me down there?"
562,562,Jason's dead.
563,563,Jesus.
564,564,We've gotta go.
565,565,Can you move?
566,566,"Yeah, I think so."
567,567,"Ah, shit."
568,568,We've gotta move.
569,569,"Samuel, Samuel, don't leave me!"
570,570,"Samuel, Samuel (sobs)."
571,571,Who's the desperate one now?
572,572,"This is my verse now, Samuel!"
573,573,"Morning, Dean!"
574,574,"Don't know where you are, but I know you can hear this."
575,575,"Gotta say, Dean, I'm impressed by what you did yesterday."
576,576,"Knew this hunt was gonna be different, but I never could've imagined it was gonna be this exciting."
577,577,"In fact, thought I'd bring someone along to make it even better."
578,578,"Dean, who the hell is this?"
579,579,"You don't make a deal with the devil, Dean, and not expect him to collect what's due."
580,580,Say hello.
581,581,"Dean, they've got me and Reese."
582,582,I think you get the picture.
583,583,"Imma make this real easy on you, Dean."
584,584,You got 10 seconds.
585,585,Dean.
586,586,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, No!"
587,587,"Copy that, (mumbles)."
588,588,"That's right, she's still alive."
589,589,"She'll stay that way, as long as I get what I want."
590,590,"Doing good, Dean."
591,591,Further than I ever thought you'd make it.
592,592,Where's my family?
593,593,"Like I said before, they're safe."
594,594,Whether or not they stay that way is entirely up to you.
595,595,"You have something I want, something you stole from me."
596,596,Where is it?
597,597,My family first (Sam chuckles).
598,598,You think you're in a position to be making demands?
599,599,"Okay, see what your wife has to say about this..."
600,600,"No wait, no wait."
601,601,"Please, I'll show you, just don't hurt her, please."
602,602,Where?
603,603,"It's in the mountains, I'll show you."
604,604,So we have an agreement then?
605,605,Yes!
606,606,"Swear to it, Dean."
607,607,"Yes, I swear on my life."
608,608,"I'll show you, just please don't hurt them."
609,609,"That wasn't so hard after all, was it?"
610,610,"Funny, isn't it?"
611,611,Only thing you love the most ends up hurting in the end.
612,612,"I'll take you to the DVDs, you'll let 'em go, right?"
613,613,Right.
614,614,And that's it.
615,615,That's it?
616,616,"Don't your remember, Dean?"
617,617,We had a contract.
618,618,"I have two, well, a day and a half left."
619,619,This has gone too far.
620,620,There is no too far.
621,621,"Shoulda paid attention, Dean."
622,622,There are no rules in the hunt.
623,623,You got me.
624,624,I'm dead already!
625,625,True enough.
626,626,I guess I'll just have to take my time.
627,627,"Admit it, Dean, you've been going there for a while."
628,628,Expect you to make it this long.
629,629,"See, I'm a man that like to play with fire."
630,630,But ultimately...
631,631,"No, please."
632,632,Just like having control.
633,633,"No, no (breathes heavily)."
634,634,"No, no, no (groans)!"
635,635,"About that time, isn't it?"
636,636,Wouldn't want you to run off again.
637,637,"Well, let's go."
638,638,I can't.
639,639,"Fine, where is it?"
640,640,Up there on the ridge.
641,641,"All right, you stay here, you're with me."
642,642,Check it out.
643,643,"You can't hide from me now, Dean."
644,644,Find you wherever you go.
645,645,"You can't run forever, Dean!"
646,646,End of the line!
647,647,"Been fun, time to wrap this up."
648,648,Got a date with your wife and son later.
649,649,It's offset.
650,650,The jig's over.
651,651,You win!
652,652,Will master be joining us?
653,653,My wife and son.
654,654,Back at the house.
655,655,Would you like to count it?
656,656,"Yes, I do."
657,657,As you wish.
658,658,Bring some over your drinking.
659,659,Can I get you anything else?
660,660,"That'll be it, for now."
661,661,What are they doing with the mansion?
662,662,"They're selling it, it's in accordance with master's will."
663,663,For how much?
664,664,I'm not sure.
665,665,You go find that out.
666,666,And my wife and kids.
667,667," (peaceful music)  Dean, if you're reading this that means you've survived the hunt."
668,668,I'm glad you're still alive.
669,669,"Money is important, Dean, but it can't buy everything."
670,670,"It won't bring my son back to me, or change the fact that he died, alone and scared."
671,671,And it will never let me trust you again.
672,672,"You can tell yourself you did it for us, but that's a lie."
673,673,We both know you did it for yourself.
674,674,"Our family is gone, Dean, you sold us for a million dollars."
675,675,I hope it was worth it.
