68,68,"So, you gonna take care of us now, huh?"

144,144,"Yeah, I noticed."
145,145,What's her name?
146,146, Rosalinda.
147,147, That sounds like two names.
148,148, At least.
149,149," Yeah. Well, it's just one."
150,150,You're completely sure there's only one woman in there?
151,151,"Just one, man, it's just her."
152,152,Rosalinda.
153,153,This is the Bulwark Police.
154,154,I need you to open that door and come out with your hands up.
155,155,"Rosalinda, are you in there?"
156,156,Rosalinda speaks English?
157,157,"Yeah, yeah, but she got a problem with her ears, man."
158,158, Is she deaf?
159,159," She wears something, man, to make her hear better but not when she goes to sleep though."
160,160,He looks like a snorer.
161,161,"Yeah, it's called sleep apnea, man."
162,162,She got a firearm in there?
163,163,"No gun, man, but she got some pepper spray in her purse, so, you know..."
164,164," Oh. Come on. Come on, man."
165,165, This will be snug.
166,166,"Shit, that's cutting off my circulation."
167,167,We'll be back before your foot turns blue.
168,168,Probably.
169,169,A lot nicer than my place.
170,170,Even the smell.
171,171,We've met Davids.
172,172, Officer?
173,173, Detective?
174,174,You dove deep on this plumber thing.
175,175,I've got a cousin who plumbs.
176,176,Vasquez a shackle?
177,177,On the fire escape.
178,178,His deaf girlfriend's in here.
179,179,You guys gonna shoot her?
180,180, She's got a gun.
181,181," 75percent chance, yeah."
182,182,All right. Where do you want me?
183,183,Window.
184,184,Should've let the plumber in.
185,185,Police. Okay?
186,186,"Comprende, si or no?"
187,187,Her handbag seemed a little heavy.
188,188,You been taking into account the amount of makeup  Latinas carry?
189,189," Yeah, even still."
190,190,She's got a gun.
191,191,"gasps Come on. Come on, honey."
192,192,You stay there.
193,193,Why don't you shut the doors and crank up the fans?
194,194,Where did your novio put that green duffel bag you got last night?
195,195,Can I have something to wear?
196,196,I'm cold.
197,197,"I didn't understand that, did you?"
198,198,No.
199,199,Sounded kind of like dolphin.
200,200,I expect she'll get more intelligible when she answers our questions.
201,201, Where's the green duffel bag?
202,202, I'm gonna call a lawyer.
203,203,I wanna... stutters Where's the green duffel bag?
204,204,"We saw Vasquez bring it here last night at 11:00, that swell guy who fled and left you here with us."
205,205," You see, a time..."
206,206, rolls ball ...to get a soulmate.
207,207,Tell us where it is and my partner and I will be done in time to get the breakfast special at Bert's.
208,208,Maybe that's reason enough to forget all about you and that gun of yours.
209,209,Where is it?
210,210,The closet.
211,211,There.
212,212,In the wall behind the suits.
213,213,I smell three eggs over easy.
214,214,Hash browns...
215,215,and pumpernickel toast.
216,216,Plus that coffee you owe me.
217,217, Officer.
218,218, Detective?
219,219,Drag Vasquez back inside.
220,220,"We got cash, narcotics, and two imbeciles to drive downtown and paper."
221,221,You said if I told you where the bag was you'll let me go.
222,222, Can you understand her?
223,223, No.
224,224,âª We can be considerate âª âª To people or strangers âª âª Until you get to know them âª âª Ooh âª This a guy or a girl singing this song?
225,225,âª Yeah âª âª It's raining so hard outside âª âª Before you go I'll give you my favorite umbrella âª âª To keep you dry âª Can't tell.
226,226,âª Would you like to have... âª Not that there's much of a difference these days.
227,227,I think that line was obliterated.
228,228,"The day men started saying, ""We're pregnant,"" when their wives were."
229,229,Your breakfast specials.
230,230,Thanks.
231,231, cell phone vibrates  cell phone chimes Didn't know the Chief Lieutenant was so fond of intrigue.
232,232,Excuse me.
233,233,Could you box our food up in togo containers?
234,234,You want me to pack up everything I just carried from all the way over there?
235,235,Correct.
236,236,I'll get some takeout boxes.
237,237,You two crashed into a truck filled with breakfast buffet?
238,238,We were getting the breakfast specials at Bert's when we got your message and we boxed them up and rode in with the ruminations.
239,239,I like their pumpernickel toast.
240,240,"They get it fresh from Jeanette's, bakery across the way."
241,241,clears throat There's an issue with the bust you two made this morning.
242,242,Who's complaining?
243,243,"Civilian, saw you out on the fire escape."
244,244,Vasquez was armed and a threat.
245,245, We did what was...
246,246, There's a video.
247,247,You've seen it?
248,248,I have. It's not terrible.
249,249,"Certainly could be much, much better."
250,250,Sound is shit.
251,251,Civilian was too far away to get anything intelligible.
252,252, That helps us.
253,253, Who tipped you off?
254,254,My contact at Channel 7.
255,255,long sniff Anchovies.
256,256, When's it airing?
257,257, Six o'clock.
258,258,You'll survive.
259,259,"Though, I think it'll end our current discussions about raises and promotions."
260,260,Anchovies.
261,261,We didn't give Vasquez that much castiron.
262,262," It was mostly me, Anthony..."
263,263, He gave him plenty.
264,264,"Mr. Lurasetti's in that video, too, smiling like a yearbook picture when you put your foot on that hombre's cabeza."
265,265,Our inspector...
266,266,"our MexicanAmerican inspector, is unlikely to be lenient."
267,267,Though your productivity is exemplary and it'll keep you from losing your badges.
268,268,Politics like always.
269,269,"Like cell phones and just as annoying, politics are everywhere."
270,270,Being branded a racist in today's public forum is like being accused of communism in the '50s whether it's a possibly offensive remark made in a private phone call or the indelicate treatment of a minority who sells drugs to children.
271,271,"The entertainment industry, formerly known as the news,  needs villains."
272,272, There's certainly nothing hypocritical about the media handling every perceived intolerance with complete and utter intolerance.
273,273,It's bullshit.
274,274,But it's reality.
275,275,But I'm not racist.
276,276,Every Martin Luther King Day I order a cup of dark roast.
277,277,How long is this suspension gonna be?
278,278,Six weeks.
279,279,No pay.
280,280,We need the hours.
281,281,I know what detectives make and more.
282,282,Go have some pumpernickel.
283,283,Ridgeman.
284,284,Gotta be aware of this stuff.
285,285,Digital eyes are everywhere.
286,286,I do what I think best when I'm out there.
287,287,I was that way when we were partners and I'm still that way now.
288,288,There's a reason I'm sitting behind this desk running things and you're out there crouching on fire escapes in the cold for hours with a partner that's 20 years younger than you.
289,289,"Hey, Anthony's got a mouth with its own engine but he's solid."
290,290,That wasn't my point.
291,291,Thanks for letting us know about this situation and any word you can have with the inspector on our behalf would be greatly appreciated.
292,292,One thing before you go.
293,293,I watched that video a couple times.
294,294,You threw a lot more castiron than you needed to.
295,295,And when we worked together...
296,296,you weren't that rough.
297,297,And?
298,298,It's not healthy for you to scuff concrete as long as you have.
299,299,"You get results, but you're losing perspective and compassion."
300,300,Couple more years out there and you're gonna be a human steamroller covered with spikes...
301,301,and fueled by bile.
302,302,There's a lot of imbeciles out there.
303,303,Yeah.
304,304,Use your time off to think about things.
305,305,Talk it over with Melanie.
306,306,Spend some time with her and Sara.
307,307,"Yeah, I will."
308,308,I won't.
309,309,I won't.
310,310,Sara?
311,311,"Yeah, Mom, it's me."
312,312,Sweetie?
313,313,What's wrong?
314,314,Sweetie?
315,315,Come here.
316,316,Good evening.
317,317,"And welcome back, Mr. Lurasetti."
318,318,Anybody born in New York  calls me Tony.
319,319, Tony it is.
320,320,"One moment, please."
321,321,"Is something wrong with it, Tony?"
322,322,"No, no, it's beautiful."
323,323,Exactly like you promised.
324,324,"It's... If Denise has any doubts about saying yes when I'm on my knee, this will nudge her in the right direction."
325,325,I got an issue at work.
326,326,Do you need a payment plan?
327,327, I'd be more than happy to...
328,328, Thanks.
329,329,I saved enough for this. It's a different kind of problem.
330,330,My wife has two brothers who are therapists and three sisters who were lawyers.
331,331,"Well, my problems don't require those kinds of professionals."
332,332,"I just... I'm thinking about the kind of future I can offer my girlfriend and, you know, that life won't have a lot of diamonds."
333,333,You must be ready by tomorrow night.
334,334,Okay. You gotta be careful around these parts.
335,335,It's got lions.
336,336,Can we shoot them?
337,337,"Well, yeah."
338,338,But it's gonna be pretty hard unless you have a pumpaction shotgun.
339,339,"Not if we get one... Oh, shit."
340,340,"Okay, look. Get behind me."
341,341,"Okay, stay there."
342,342,Nigga iced that feline.
343,343,"Okay, look, we gotta go."
344,344,There's more coming.
345,345,"Okay, once you get across this stream, we gotta look out for boa constrictors."
346,346,This nigga's ready for a real safari.
347,347,Even if my legs worked right I wouldn't wanna be hunting animals for real.
348,348,It's like some rich white people shit.
349,349,"Still, you're real good at this game."
350,350,"And the other ones we played, too."
351,351,"Well, yeah, this is what I wanna do when I grow up."
352,352, Play games?
353,353," No. No, be a game designer."
354,354,"To create worlds that are, you know, different from the outside."
355,355,There's schools that teach you how to do that?
356,356, College or something?
357,357, Yeah. They got schools.
358,358,"Maybe once you finish high school, you can..."
359,359, cell phone vibrates  pauses game I gotta go.
360,360,Can you save this adventure?
361,361,Yeah. I can save it.
362,362,All right.
363,363,His cousins are gonna be there this time.
364,364,"Yeah, they are."
365,365,I don't like doing things with so many question marks everywhere.
366,366,Yeah. Me neither.
367,367,But they was moved up.
368,368,You already got our advances.
369,369,"Plus, Andrei already vouched for 'em."
370,370,Andrei himself is questionable.
371,371,You got our insurance?
372,372,In the glove compartment.
373,373,Why'd you want them wrapped in cellophane?
374,374,There's some times a nigga ain't got time for gloves...
375,375,or to wipe things down.
376,376,Yeah. We don't need to use those.
377,377,We'll stash them in the vehicles when we get the chance.
378,378,The van and the getaway.
379,379,It's all cotton candy.
380,380,reporter The two detectives were filmed by a concerned Bulwark citizen this morning.
381,381,Both partners have been suspended.
382,382,Brett Ridgeman was charged with excessive force in 1998 and 2004...
383,383,And Anthony Lurasetti was suspended for violating the code of conduct last year.
384,384,The police commissioner has declined to comment...
385,385,You've got five seconds to hand me your drawer.

398,398, Hey.
399,399, Hey.
400,400, Want a beer?
401,401," No, thanks."
402,402,I have to take some extra meds today.
403,403,I'm sorry to hear that.
404,404,You okay?
405,405,Fair.
406,406,What's that about?
407,407,Some kids were menacing Sara on her way back from the bus and one of them threw a cup of orange soda all over her.
408,408, What kids?
409,409, The one she didn't recognize.
410,410,"Four blacks, one on a bike."
411,411,But does it actually matter who?
412,412,That's the fifth time.
413,413,"This fucking neighborhood, it just keeps getting worse and worse."
414,414, Is she okay?
415,415," Well, yeah. But, coming home from school and walking four blocks  shouldn't be an ordeal."
416,416, No. It shouldn't.
417,417,"Did you offer to pick her up at the bus, escort her back?"
418,418,Of course I did.
419,419,She knows it isn't easy for me to get around a lot and she'd be too embarrassed anyways.
420,420,"Well, she's got two sets of cop DNA, so of course she's tough."
421,421,"Yeah, especially for her age and gender."
422,422,"But she's getting older, more womanly."
423,423,"And these boys are gonna start having different kinds of ideas about her pretty soon, if they don't already."
424,424,"You know, I never thought I was a racist before living in this area."
425,425,I'm about as liberal as any excop could ever be. But now...
426,426, We really need to move.
427,427, I know.
428,428,No. Yesterday or the day before.
429,429,I know.
430,430,"Well, this thing that's going on with you and Anthony right now,  it's not gonna help."
431,431, You saw the Vasquez footage?
432,432, I did.
433,433, And?
434,434,It's really time you got a new windbreaker.
435,435,Yeah.
436,436,A couple people made comments.
437,437,"Well, I was starting to say before that I called up Bulwark Security Provider  and I asked them..."
438,438, You're not doing security work.
439,439,We need money to move.
440,440,Absolutely not.
441,441, I can take painkillers if...
442,442, No. You're taking painkillers to peel potatoes as it is.
443,443,It's not worth debating.
444,444,But I wanna do something.
445,445,"I need to do something as a mother, as a former cop."
446,446,"Or someday, someday you and me we are in a hospital room with our daughter talking to a rape counselor."
447,447,Yeah.
448,448,I'll handle this.
449,449,How?
450,450,There's a way.
451,451,But it's not something that we're gonna talk about...
452,452,ever.
453,453,Okay.
454,454,knocking Sara.
455,455,Yeah?
456,456,That show about the lion cubs is on if you wanna watch it with me.
457,457,"If you'd rather read that's, you know..."
458,458,"No, it's fine."
459,459,Been staring at the same page for the past 20 minutes anyway.
460,460,"Hey, you want something to nibble?"
461,461,Sure.
462,462,Are you okay with what happened?
463,463,"Yeah, I'm fine."
464,464,Hey.
465,465,Hey.
466,466, Do you want a cookie?
467,467," No, thank you."
468,468,They're so cute before they get big.
469,469,I got an errand to run.
470,470,Be back in a couple hours.
471,471,I'm here to talk with Friedrich or Freddie if he prefers.
472,472, And who can I say is...
473,473, Tell him Ridgeman is here.
474,474, I'll go see if he's available.
475,475, He is.
476,476,How much are these?
477,477,I don't see a tag.
478,478,Five thousand dollars.
479,479,So they're bulletproof?
480,480,You care for a drink?
481,481,I'm not here for a beverage.
482,482,Yes.
483,483,You're looking for a new suit?
484,484,Now that you have violently earned some leisure time.
485,485, I'm not.
486,486, Why then have you decided to inhabit my shop this evening?
487,487,How's your son doing?
488,488,"Well, very well."
489,489,His mother and I are taking him to visit some campuses next month.
490,490,He scored very high on his tests.
491,491,I thought he had potential.
492,492,Thank you.
493,493,I know that you're not inclined towards exceptions.
494,494,"Well, he was a kid, the ringleaders are in jail and I knew I could get something more valuable from you someday if I let him slip through a crack."
495,495, How can I be of aid?
496,496, I need a lead.
497,497,And what are you hoping to find?
498,498,"A dealer, or a buyer."
499,499,Preferably one from out of town.
500,500,I am not as wellinformed as I once was.
501,501,Call someone that is.
502,502,I shall.
503,503,Now.
504,504,Anthony. Yeah.
505,505,Be outside my place at 4:30.
506,506,"Yup, a.m."
507,507,Put on your fake license plate.
508,508,Bring all your hardware and dress nonchalant.
509,509,cell phone vibrates Are you the famous police officer I saw in the news?
510,510,Any reason you're back there?
511,511,There is.
512,512,Things okay with you and Melanie?
513,513,They're fine.
514,514,Are you gonna tell me the nature of this endeavor?
515,515,I'm gonna sleep.
516,516,What are we here...
517,517,You're gonna drive to 19th and Brant.
518,518,Why are we going all the way up there?
519,519,Every answer I give you is gonna engender three times as many questions.
520,520,"Let me sleep while I can and once we're there, you'll get your answers and a nap if you need one."
521,521,Sounds like a stake out.
522,522,You realize we're suspended.
523,523,Wake me at 18th.
524,524,We're at 18th.
525,525,Corner right.
526,526,Before you touch anything.
527,527,Ash tray.
528,528,One of these big orange things opened up by my apartment.
529,529,Ripe and Fresh.
530,530, Shit?
531,531, I haven't been in it.
532,532,I thought Denise cooked.
533,533,Only at her place.
534,534,She only shops at organic stores that specialize in assuaging guilt.
535,535,Let's pull over the other side of this dumpster.
536,536, Is this good?
537,537, It's perfect.
538,538,Take two.
539,539,Something's going on in Room 633 of that tan stucco.
540,540,What?
541,541,Hard to tell.
542,542,Especially because Apartment 633 doesn't even exist.
543,543,How do you mean?
544,544,"Well, there's no door marked There's no windows or a buzzer."
545,545,No mail gets delivered there either.
546,546,But it's there.
547,547,This is sounding metaphysical.
548,548,You got a tip on this?
549,549,Yeah.
550,550,My contact tells me that one Lorentz Vogelmann is looking for an invisible residence.
551,551,And 633 in this tan stucco is where he landed.
552,552,"Vogelmann, I don't know that name."
553,553,"Well, he's not local."
554,554,What line of work is he in?
555,555,Distribution.
556,556,Heroin mostly.
557,557,Large bundles.
558,558,What are we doing here?
559,559,You asking me this question as a civilian?
560,560,"Because that's what we are right now, civilians."
561,561,No different than kindergarten teachers or the bum that collects aluminum cans outside my building.
562,562,I know where I flung my badge yesterday.
563,563,What are we doing here?
564,564,We're monitoring a suspicious individual to try and figure out if he's got any money he doesn't need.
565,565,Anchovies.
566,566, If you don't wanna be part of...
567,567, Christ.
568,568,Are you insane?
569,569,"You get suspended, not for the first time in your career either."
570,570,Now you decide to become a criminal?
571,571,And what the hell are you even thinking with this?
572,572,Well...
573,573,Say something.
574,574,Talk!
575,575,I'm a month away from my 60th...
576,576,I'm still the same rank I was at 27.
577,577,"For a lot of years, I believed that the quality of my work, what we do together, what I did with my previous partners..."
578,578,would get me what I deserved.
579,579,But I don't politic and I don't change with the times.
580,580,And it turns out that that shit's more important than good honest work.
581,581,"So yesterday, after we stop a massive amount of drugs from getting into the school system, we get suspended because it wasn't done politely."
582,582,When I go home and I find my daughter has been assaulted for the fifth time in two years Because of the shit neighborhood my shit wage has forced me to live in.
583,583,And my wife can't help.
584,584,She's barely getting through the day on her meds as it is.
585,585,They okay?
586,586,Yeah. Melanie's coping.
587,587,Sara's doing okay.
588,588,She's dealing with it better than most kids her age would.
589,589,But who knows what kind of longterm damage is going on with her.
590,590,"There has been opportunities before, more than a few."
591,591,"Take a bribe, pocket a bundle, pilfer cash."
592,592,I was a cop on active duty.
593,593,"Today, I'm a poor civilian who's nearly 60."
594,594,"I can accept that, but I'm not gonna ask my wife and daughter to."
595,595,"If we put all our collars together, every imbecile we ever nabbed, it'd probably fill two entire wings of the state prison."
596,596,Maybe three.
597,597,We have the skills and the right to acquire proper compensation.
598,598, Christ.
599,599, Weddings aren't cheap.
600,600,Don't be an asshole. That's not what I'm thinking about.
601,601,Do you think our wages accurately reflect what we did?
602,602,Enough with the justifications.
603,603,"I'm smarter than you by a yard stick, you're not gonna manipulate me."
604,604,I saw how you looked at that duffel bag yesterday.
605,605,Quiet.
606,606,Let me think.
607,607,Anchovies.
608,608,"Look, if you don't wanna hear any more about this, fling the gear and drop me off."
609,609, I don't want you to get hurt.
610,610, I don't need a guardian.
611,611,I can do this myself if I have to.
612,612,You don't know that.
613,613,"Not for sure, no."
614,614,"But if things get tricky, I'll disengage and find something else."
615,615,This is a bad idea.
616,616,"It's bad for you, and it's bad for me."
617,617,It's bad like lasagna in a can.
618,618,"Well, then, fling the gear and drop me off."
619,619,"Look, if you do this, you do it for yourself."
620,620,You don't do it because you pity my situation.
621,621,"Or because we're partners or because we're friends that grill burgers on Sundays, or go to the fights."
622,622,You do it solely because you wanna earn. And that's it.
623,623,We disguise ourselves at the point of contact.
624,624,"Yeah, I got ballistic masks and vests in the garbage bags, some teargas bombs as well."
625,625,I'm in until I'm not.
626,626, Lorentz Vogelmann?
627,627, Yeah.
628,628,He looks cast iron.
629,629,He is.
630,630,Any idea if his merchandise is in 633?
631,631,"No idea, but after we confirm that he's there, we'll tail him and we'll learn his itinerary."
632,632,You got a timeframe?
633,633,My contact said he's rendered 633 for two weeks.
634,634,We're at day two of that period.
635,635,"You know anything else about him, vehicles, associates?"
636,636,That's what we're learning now.
637,637,Camera?
638,638,Thanks.
639,639,Why don't you take a nap?
640,640,Gladly.
641,641,Make sure to ask me if I'm still in when I wake up.
642,642,I've been processing here for five hours.
643,643,You should have given me a nudge.
644,644,There wasn't a reason to.
645,645,Are you still in?
646,646,I am until I'm not.
647,647, You see Vogelmann yet?
648,648, Nope.
649,649,I'm gonna get something from this big orange thing.
650,650,You want egg salad on rye toast?
651,651,"Two of them, and root beer."
652,652,Amen.
653,653,I've been listening to and smelling that for the last 98 minutes.
654,654,"Best part of a stake out, other than when it ends..."
655,655,is when you're eating.
656,656,A single red ant could've eaten it faster.
657,657,Nope.
658,658,Take two.
659,659,I'm still enjoying the aftertaste.
660,660,Not all of us are.
661,661,Where did you park?
662,662,"I've been telling you, you're getting senile."
663,663,You didn't lock it?
664,664,I for...
665,665,I was thinking about something else at the time. Sorry.
666,666,This your duffel?
667,667,I don't think so.
668,668,Face the windshield.
669,669,Put on your seat belts and lock the doors.
670,670,Paco...
671,671,"put up that sunshade, por favor."
672,672,Good. Now empty your pockets.
673,673,"Put everything in that duffel bag, or you'll be painting houses in heaven."
674,674,"No, please."
675,675,You have five seconds.
676,676,Four...
677,677, Three...
678,678, That's all I got.
679,679,"Me too, I swear to God."
680,680,Show me your pocket whites.
681,681,See?
682,682,Shut off that phone.
683,683,Bye.
684,684,I expected you...
685,685,You'll f...
686,686,Airless.
687,687,"Please, allow me to show you the interior."
688,688,"If anything moves in there, a rat, a mouse, a baby mosquito, you'll get to ring Allah's doorbell."
689,689,Pop the hood.
690,690,All is as expected?
691,691,The blood is gratis.
692,692,Keys.
693,693,"Melanie Brett, that you?"
694,694,Confirmed.
695,695,"Look in the closet, I got you something."
696,696,Try it on.
697,697,Everything you get me fits perfect.
698,698,Thanks for getting it.
699,699,Thank me in bed.
700,700,"So, did you guys beat up any minorities today?"
701,701,That's only when we're on the clock.
702,702, This was really delicious.
703,703, Glad you liked it.
704,704,And should I infer from your reticence this is one of those times you can't talk about your work?
705,705,"Please, infer about my reticence."
706,706,Even though you've been suspended and you're technically a civilian?
707,707,Criminals don't stop doing what they do just 'cause two cops get benched.
708,708,And we don't do what we do just for the paycheck.
709,709,What?
710,710,Don't try and bluff somebody who's smarter than you are.
711,711,Smarter by a yardstick.
712,712,Did you see I brought cannolis from Theo Renzo's?
713,713,"Just don't do anything to jeopardize your career, please."
714,714,I won't.
715,715,Seven unaccounted for.
716,716,"If Vogelmann's in that tan stucco and owns a vehicle, one of them is his."
717,717,Are you still in?
718,718,At the outermost edge.
719,719,Denise?
720,720,She guessed that something wasn't right.
721,721,I didn't say anything.
722,722,So?
723,723,Picked up the engagement ring.
724,724, From Feinbaum?
725,725, Yeah.
726,726,Okay.
727,727,"Got it the day we busted, uh, Vasquez and..."
728,728,"Well, the timing wasn't great, but..."
729,729,"I was gonna propose anyway, I wasn't gonna let some work bullshit interfere with my private life, but turned out..."
730,730,"she was in a bad mood that night because of some drama at her job, and I didn't do it."
731,731,"And then yesterday you bring me here, suggest this thing, and I'm sort of okay with the idea, us taking money off some fuckhead dealer."
732,732,If the risk isn't too great.
733,733,"But, you know, that night, when I see Denise, even before she suspected anything..."
734,734,I know that I can't propose to her until this thing is done.
735,735,I evade her questions at dinner and for the first time since I went to the jeweler...
736,736,I'm not certain she'd say yes if I proposed.
737,737,Yeah. I'm driving you home.
738,738,I haven't made a decision yet.
739,739,I'm just pondering...
740,740,"Bullshit. You're decided, even if you think you aren't."
741,741,"You're younger than me, you've got more options."
742,742,"Request a new partner when we're back on duty, they'll probably make you a sergeant one day."
743,743,I don't want a new partner.
744,744,And I told you that I'd finish out the shift.
745,745,"Yeah, I appreciate it."
746,746,"But look, you're not obligated."
747,747, I have done it with...
748,748, My word is an obligation.
749,749,Thanks.
750,750,"Two egg salads, and I'll pay for yours, too, if it's not Sobrasada."
751,751,Here's one.
752,752,This guy's parking.
753,753,These brothers have seen some stuff.
754,754,"Yeah, they're tainted."
755,755,Think they're with Vogelmann?
756,756,His buyers?
757,757,Twentypercent.
758,758,Gobetweens or local muscles probably more like it.
759,759,And two root beers.
760,760,No choice.
761,761,Ridgeman?
762,762, Vogelmann?
763,763, Yeah.
764,764,The black dudes we saw before.
765,765,They're going west.
766,766,Are you sure?
767,767,engine sputtering The grey lady needs a decongestant.
768,768,Don't give 'em a wedgie.
769,769,Driving any slower than this will get us noticed.
770,770,I don't know this area real well. What's west?
771,771,"Well, more of this."
772,772,Then the turnpike and then the school district.
773,773,Probably not doing all this to steal crayons.
774,774,You feel like some construction work?
775,775,Is that necessary right now?
776,776,Five percent.
777,777,"That's for shooting out tires, sending a warning, things like that, right?"
778,778,We're not going after any precedence.
779,779,I need a better answer than that.
780,780,"Right now, we're heading into new territory."
781,781,"Foggy gray landscape, but I know all of my limits, but maybe not yours."
782,782,"So before I build a killing instrument that I last used in the army, I wanna hear that you don't plan on executing a human being to facilitate a robbery."
783,783,We're not executing anybody.
784,784,That boundary is reinforced in steel concrete.
785,785,"Agreed. Now, build."
786,786,The carpool lane.
787,787,Right by the black SUV.
788,788,Don't let that catch you cold.
789,789,You think the transactions happened today?
790,790,"Oh, this is business."
791,791,Two tainted black dudes and an outoftown convict going for a drive before dawn.
792,792,Although it's probably just a preliminary.
793,793,Vogelmann was carrying two black briefcases when he got in.
794,794,Is there anything else you forgot to tell me?
795,795, No.
796,796, No. Are you sure?
797,797,"Something subtle, like maybe one of the black dudes  had a bazooka?"
798,798, Hey.
799,799,I was up for hours listening to you process air. It escaped me.
800,800,Fine.
801,801,"And I suppose you could have let me sleep through all of this, and been done with the whole thing."
802,802,I definitely should have.
803,803,Considering the briefcases...
804,804,seventy percent this is the transaction.
805,805,What's the other 30?
806,806,"Vogelmann maybe showing somebody some cash, or some merchandise, depending on which end of the deal he's doing."
807,807,The briefcases?
808,808,The financial district?
809,809,What's going on here?
810,810,Any idea?
811,811,I'm trying to flush the ideas I have 'cause none of them seem to fit this.
812,812,Still under construction.
813,813,Want me to mail or hand deliver your genius award?
814,814,Nice.
815,815,Real stylish.
816,816,You're saying this before you use your gay hair shit?
817,817,Can't say it after.
818,818,Time for a walk by?
819,819,At 5:45.
820,820,Why is that?
821,821,"Well, the nearest most likely time for a meet up is 5:30, and we should allow the other party room for tardiness."
822,822,Unless Vogelmann is 19 minutes late.
823,823,"Possible, but not probable."
824,824,And I'm doing the walk by myself.
825,825, Usually...
826,826, You're barely here as it is.
827,827,Any and every bigger risk we come upon is mine to take.
828,828,spraying coughs I'll do you first.
829,829,Don't make no mess of it.
830,830,I used to graffiti back in the day.
831,831,And I remember what it looked like.
832,832,"You would know better yourself, you know that?"
833,833,I was only doing tags.
834,834,You was the one trying to make art.
835,835,Nigga painted a pitbull everybody thought was a turtle.
836,836,Nothing.
837,837,How about getting on a nearby roof for a better vantage?
838,838,"Not worth the exposure, or the risk of us getting split up in case things get urgent."
839,839,This is a bad location for...
840,840,Who the hell are those guys?
841,841,Must have been here since before Vogelmann arrived.
842,842,It's them.
843,843,Who?
844,844,The black dudes.
845,845,The ones who drove Vogelmann.
846,846, Anchovies.
847,847, Crud.
848,848,Any idea what's going on here?
849,849,I dunno. These guys expect to be exposed to people or a camera at some point.
850,850,That's the only way those disguises make any sense.
851,851,What kind of job?
852,852,Robbery?
853,853,Kidnapping?
854,854, Murder?
855,855, One or some of those. Yeah.
856,856,Ma'am?
857,857,You need some assistance?
858,858,Sorry.
859,859,Can you hold that?
860,860,Please hold it. Ma'am?
861,861,Jeffrey?
862,862,"Jeffrey, let me in."
863,863, Open this.
864,864," Kelly, please stop yelling."
865,865, I was in the bathroom.
866,866, Why put the chain on the door?
867,867,Why aren't you on your way to work?
868,868,You are not allowed to answer a question with a question.
869,869,"Don't shout at me, okay?"
870,870,Just...
871,871,"You need to go back downstairs, get on the bus and go to work."
872,872, Open this right now.
873,873, I can't.
874,874,What do you mean you can't?
875,875,Of course you can.
876,876,"I want to, I really, really do, but I can't."
877,877,The maternity leave ended four weeks ago.
878,878,You've used all of your vacation and every single sick day staying here with Jackson.
879,879,He needed me.
880,880,I'm taking good care of him...
881,881,and I will continue to do so until you're home from work.
882,882,I hate you.
883,883,And I love you twice as much.
884,884,You need to go to work... today.
885,885,My job is so stupid.
886,886,"I go there and I sell chunks of my life for a paycheck, so that..."
887,887,rich people I've never even met can put money in places I've never even seen.
888,888,How am I supposed to sit at a stupid desk and talk about bank accounts when my baby is here?
889,889,"Jackson needs diapers, and clothes and gourmet baby food."
890,890,"Eventually, he's gonna need school supplies."
891,891,"And if he's anything like me and my brothers, he'll need braces, too."
892,892,"Now, all these things cost money and you make way more than I do."
893,893,"Yeah, I know."
894,894,Please get on the bus and go to work.
895,895,Okay.
896,896,I'm sorry I said I hate you.
897,897,That's all right.
898,898,I know what you really meant.
899,899,Can I see him though?
900,900,Just through the opening.
901,901,"I promise, I'll go if you let me see him just for a second."
902,902, I need to touch him.
903,903," Kelly, please..."
904,904,I... Just for a second.
905,905,I swear I'll go.
906,906,You've broken that swear before and recently.
907,907,Do you swear on the life of our baby that you will leave after you've touched him?
908,908,"No, no, no."
909,909,"Say it out loud for it to count, that's how swears work."
910,910,I swear on the life of our child that I will go to work after I've touched him.
911,911,You swore on his life.
912,912,I'll see you both when I get home from work.
913,913,So cute.
914,914,Hey.
915,915, Hey.
916,916, Hi.
917,917," Welcome back, bonita."
918,918, Thank you.
919,919,Good heavens and praise be to Him.
920,920,Can that radiant vision of maternity that just walked through our front doors possibly be our beloved Mrs. Summer?
921,921,Welcome back.
922,922,Welcome back and congratulations on bringing such a lovely boy child into this world.
923,923,"Thank you, Mr. Edmington."
924,924,All of us in the bank have great expectations for your boy.
925,925,Wondrous expectations on a global scale.
926,926,So do I.
927,927,"Well, in that case, our expectations are aligned."
928,928, Yeah.
929,929, Welcome back.
930,930, Nice to see you.
931,931, You too.
932,932,"Mrs. Summer, your absence was a weight upon us, your return is a divine blessing."
933,933,It was just three months.
934,934,"Nevertheless, a doleful era."
935,935,You really shouldn't look that good after having a baby.
936,936,Thanks.
937,937,It's kind of annoying how good you look.
938,938, Thank you.
939,939, I made cupcakes.
940,940," Oh, double chocolate."
941,941, Of course.
942,942,"Oh, yeah, your husband helped me with that part."
943,943,"A small token, a minuscule manifestation of our affections."
944,944,"Mr. Edmington, everybody, really, thank you for this, really."
945,945,"It was really hard to leave the baby, but..."
946,946,Any deliveries scheduled for today?
947,947,"No, not that I'm aware of."
948,948,"Everyone, listen."
949,949,"Hands up, and keep them there or this man dies."
950,950,distorted voice Keep your hands raised.
951,951,Cooperate.
952,952,"If you make any sudden moves, you will be executed."
953,953,If the police show up everyone will be executed.
954,954,Do not prioritize money over having a heartbeat.
955,955,Do you understand?
956,956,Yes.
957,957, Mr. Edmington.
958,958, Sir.
959,959,Are there any employees in the back?
960,960,"If so, get them right now."
961,961,You have 20 seconds.
962,962,"No, there is no one in the back, everyone is here in the front."
963,963,Are you certain of this response?
964,964,You appear to be uncertain.
965,965,"No, I'm quite certain everyone is here in the front of the bank."
966,966,We will accept this response.
967,967,"If you are mistaken, your testicles will be removed..."
968,968,with this.
969,969,"Please, let's not talk about anything rash."
970,970,"Everyone is here, as I said,  in the front of the bank..."
971,971, You.
972,972,You seem honest and obedient.
973,973,"Handcuff every single person here, except for the manager."
974,974,Use these.
975,975,Fasten their hands behind their backs.
976,976,Tight.
977,977,"Do not say anything to anyone at any time, or you will be executed."
978,978,Mr. Edmington.
979,979,Sir.
980,980,One of us will follow you to the vaults.
981,981,Open them all.
982,982,I will open every vault that I am capable of opening for you.
983,983,"If our associate does not return with gold bullion in three minutes or less, we will execute this woman."
984,984,clock ticking Send it.
985,985,Will you make sure my baby gets this?
986,986,His name is Jackson.
987,987,Must have gone this way.
988,988,Think they know we're following?
989,989,Thirty percent.
990,990,Though I'm hoping they saw us at Brownvine.
991,991,You're hoping they saw us?
992,992,"Yeah, if they know they've been spotted, maybe they'll abort whatever it is they got planned."
993,993,Glad to hear your priorities changed.
994,994,"Well, civilians are at risk, they're the priority."
995,995,"Money or no money, badge or no badge. You had doubts?"
996,996,"Microscopic ones, if any, but..."
997,997,good to hear things articulated.
998,998,Trusted bank of North Bulwark.
999,999,That isn't ambiguous.
1000,1000,Is that an embrasure?
1001,1001, What's an embrasure?
1002,1002, See that opening?
1003,1003,The horizontal slit above the word security.
1004,1004,A guy's in there.
1005,1005,So it's a robbery.
1006,1006,Yup.
1007,1007,We wait until they drive off?
1008,1008,Yeah.
1009,1009,It's a robbery until somebody turns it into something worse.
1010,1010,You looking to box them in?
1011,1011,Pointlessly.
1012,1012,Financial district in a weekday.
1013,1013,Shouldn't engage them here.
1014,1014,You think they'd go back to the parking garage after this?
1015,1015,Fifty percent.
1016,1016,Fifty percent doesn't value anything.
1017,1017,Any yes or no question.
1018,1018,Hope this asshole doesn't get too curious.
1019,1019,"""The bank will reopen in 15 minutes, come back then."" He might have said 50, but why?"
1020,1020,Probably not.
1021,1021,This guy's like a cigarette commercial.
1022,1022,They're loading.
1023,1023,horns honking Christ.
1024,1024,We could have stopped this.
1025,1025, Are you gonna say anything?
1026,1026, Focus on that.
1027,1027,We let those people get killed.
1028,1028,You're not gonna say anything?
1029,1029,You don't have anything to say about our culpability?
1030,1030,Those Italian emotions are saying plenty.
1031,1031," Go to hell, you heartless fuck."
1032,1032, I never saw that opera.
1033,1033,"Look, by the time we knew it wasn't a routine drug deal,  it was already too late."
1034,1034, You could have called it in.
1035,1035,When the van left the parking garage.
1036,1036,Put the Bulwark PD on alert.
1037,1037,We didn't.
1038,1038,"The chance of that accomplishing anything in the 16minute interim, less than 50 percent or even 25."
1039,1039,"You wanna call the Bulwark PD, the state police, the Feds, let them handle it, go ahead."
1040,1040,"But that van, and the cutthroats inside, they'll be vapor before any enforcement agency can respond."
1041,1041,We're it.
1042,1042,You said you weren't gonna kill anyone unless it was in selfdefense.
1043,1043,You gave us your word.
1044,1044,Get on the interstate.
1045,1045,It was excessive what happened back there.
1046,1046,Do you wish to expand upon your critique?
1047,1047,Give us the urban point of view?
1048,1048,He ain't got nothing more to say.
1049,1049,"Hush that flap, nigga."
1050,1050,Keep your attention on the road.
1051,1051,We'll get through this.
1052,1052,"Muscles, Slim."
1053,1053,Yeah.
1054,1054,Place your firearms inside of the glove box.
1055,1055,That wasn't a suggestion.
1056,1056,All right.
1057,1057,Cover that weaponry with the sport section.
1058,1058,Close the door.
1059,1059,Close the door.
1060,1060,It's closed.
1061,1061,We didn't hear it click.
1062,1062,We want to hear it click.
1063,1063,Do not open that glove box unless I have given you my permission.
1064,1064,All right.
1065,1065,You see something?
1066,1066,"Nah, nothing."
1067,1067,"Crud, the interstate."
1068,1068,Any idea where they're gonna land?
1069,1069,"Somewhere rural, where they're gonna exchange vehicles, but where that is..."
1070,1070,Need gas pretty soon.
1071,1071,"Yeah, so do they."
1072,1072,We'll curb when they pull in somewhere.
1073,1073,The cans in the truck?
1074,1074,Is that a question you just asked me?
1075,1075,squeals Quiet.
1076,1076,I need to pee.
1077,1077,groans The other quiet.
1078,1078,Say another word and you're a pirate.

1082,1082,Slim.
1083,1083,Yeah?
1084,1084,Come get rid of this lady piss.
1085,1085,We'll get through this.
1086,1086,Just do what you're paid to do and never mind them back there.
1087,1087,Remember when your ma brung us out here for your birthday?
1088,1088,"You and me, at least ten other locals."
1089,1089,"Severos was there too, even though we ain't really want him around."
1090,1090,"But there was your sister's friends and a couple of neighbors, I think."
1091,1091,You wanted an ice cream cake so your ma brung it in a cooler.
1092,1092,What was it again?
1093,1093,Tyrannosaurus rex.
1094,1094,That's right. That's right.
1095,1095,I remember now.
1096,1096,Nigga was a Trex.
1097,1097,And its fangs was made out of candy corns.
1098,1098,The ones that was white with red on the tips that look like blood.
1099,1099,"The meal he just ate, Stegosaurus or whoever."
1100,1100,I was really into dinosaurs back then.
1101,1101,"Yeah, you was."
1102,1102,And you got all pissed and shit 'cause your ma gave me the biggest piece.
1103,1103,Yeah. Yeah.
1104,1104,The birthday boy gets the biggest piece.
1105,1105,And that's in the moms' handbook.
1106,1106,Yeah.
1107,1107,But she probably knew my ma wasn't taking care of me too good.
1108,1108,She knew.
1109,1109,Always had a crush on you.
1110,1110,"She knew that, too."
1111,1111,"Thanks, bro."
1112,1112,We'll get through this.
1113,1113,Together.
1114,1114,Is anybody following us?
1115,1115," Well, there's a..."
1116,1116, No.
1117,1117,Only things behind us are a green pickup and a gray car that got on a little while back.
1118,1118,Be vigilant.
1119,1119,Always am.
1120,1120,First estimate is five people dead.
1121,1121,"Two in critical, one missing."
1122,1122,Crud. That last one's a hostage.
1123,1123,Looks like a large amount of gold bullion was delivered two days ago.
1124,1124,Not a coincidence.
1125,1125,Christ.
1126,1126,Six people got punctuation.
1127,1127,Six human beings died.
1128,1128,I gotta know.
1129,1129,"In case we don't come back, I gotta know what she would have said."
1130,1130,We're coming back.
1131,1131,One hundred percent?
1132,1132,I'm at 80.
1133,1133,"Maybe even 85, you're 70."
1134,1134,Experience?
1135,1135,"Yeah, plus I'm not Italian."
1136,1136,That's her voicemail.
1137,1137,"Hey, Denise, I..."
1138,1138,I got a favor to ask you.
1139,1139,Pretty important.
1140,1140,I'm just out of town right now and I need some information back at my place.
1141,1141,"So if you could swing by and get it, I would really, really appreciate it."
1142,1142,"It's in the right pocket of my tan blazer, herringbone one that I wore to your sister's the last time."
1143,1143,"And I know this is inconvenient, but it would really be helping me out."
1144,1144,Call me when you get it.
1145,1145,"That's it, I'll talk to you soon."
1146,1146,"Love you, bye."
1147,1147,Ain't the most romantic way to propose.
1148,1148,It isn't.
1149,1149,"Denise is smart, she's very clearminded."
1150,1150,She's not gonna change her answer one way or the other because of how I asked her.
1151,1151, I'd give you about...
1152,1152, Don't tell me a percentage.
1153,1153,Watch this up here.
1154,1154,I see it.
1155,1155,Let's grab take out when we're done with this.
1156,1156,I'm really in the mood for some cellophane noodles.
1157,1157,Okay.
1158,1158,Muscles.
1159,1159,Yeah?
1160,1160,Is anybody following after us?
1161,1161,"The green pickup, the gray car?"
1162,1162, No.
1163,1163, Please check your mirrors.
1164,1164,Nothing but rust and air.
1165,1165,I'll keep an eye out.

1167,1167,to whom are you signaling?
1168,1168,"Nobody, no one."

1173,1173,We are here or we're here.

1180,1180,Look like.
1181,1181,Open the right bay.

1188,1188,Give me the key.
1189,1189,Shoot him and use the spare key.
1190,1190,The spare is on the ring that I gave to Slim.
1191,1191,Where is the key?
1192,1192,Did you check your mother's rectum?
1193,1193,Where is the key?
1194,1194,Ask a proctologist.
1195,1195,"Hold tight, nigga."
1196,1196,"Hey, get out of here."
1197,1197,"Just leave me, man."

1212,1212,One of those...
1213,1213,Do you see the key?
1214,1214,He swallowed it.
1215,1215,And Slim's still out there.
1216,1216,Should we drive past him and come at him from behind?
1217,1217,"No. We need to box him in right here, right now."
1218,1218,Conflict couldn't happen in a better less populated place than this.
1219,1219,Looks like problems with the hired help.
1220,1220, So Reed's still alive?
1221,1221, That front door looks armored.
1222,1222,Why are they making her do that?
1223,1223,They wanna clean things up before they go?
1224,1224, Seventyfive percent.
1225,1225, What's the other 25?
1226,1226,I'm not sure. Something weird.
1227,1227,This is excessive.
1228,1228, We got a leak.
1229,1229, I'm aware.
1230,1230,Don't get shot.
1231,1231,They don't have the right angle.
1232,1232,Unless they get on the ground.
1233,1233,"Since I'm already here, I'll get off the first shots."
1234,1234,You learn that in the army?
1235,1235,Geometry actually.
1236,1236,Did you see what happened to that other helper?
1237,1237, The skinny black guy?
1238,1238, Him.
1239,1239,No.
1240,1240,I think he disappeared during the first barrage.
1241,1241,That's a variable we didn't need.
1242,1242,Start the party.
1243,1243,Did you miss?
1244,1244,Don't be an asshole.
1245,1245,They're rolling bunkers on airless tires.
1246,1246,"Remove the stomach, so that the key doesn't fall into his entrails."
1247,1247,I will.
1248,1248,Think they're cops?
1249,1249,"Not unless they're crooked ones, looking for the gold."
1250,1250,I suspect these men are Slim's associates.
1251,1251,gunshot ricochets Just stay focused on your work.
1252,1252,This duo isn't properly armed for an engagement with us.
1253,1253,"It's the pale sac in there, the one that looks like..."
1254,1254,I know which one it is.
1255,1255,Careful not to pop his liver.
1256,1256,"That is the worst smell in the world, black guys especially."
1257,1257,Let's dump him and drive.
1258,1258,Shells.
1259,1259,"Should we call this in, anonymously?"
1260,1260,I'm not equipped for it.
1261,1261,Things are getting weird.
1262,1262,Get in.
1263,1263, Protection?
1264,1264, A hundred percent.
1265,1265, Thanks for letting me know.
1266,1266, You heard me. Buckle.
1267,1267,Is her home address literally in that picture?
1268,1268,Completely. And she's younger than she looks.
1269,1269,She probably had kids.
1270,1270,Do you have any loved ones at this address?
1271,1271,That photo had some very unpleasant instructions that will go to our associates.
1272,1272,Unless you do exactly what we tell you to do.
1273,1273,The drip has become a trickle.
1274,1274,Yeah. I got ears.
1275,1275,I'm concerned.
1276,1276,Should we make an announcement?
1277,1277, Say we're cops?
1278,1278, No.
1279,1279,That will increase the likelihood of hostage situation by 60 percent.
1280,1280,Hey!
1281,1281,Shitheads!
1282,1282,Listen up!
1283,1283,This is the only deal you're gonna get.
1284,1284,We're just here for the gold.
1285,1285,That's it.
1286,1286,Leave the bullion where it is and come on out.
1287,1287,We'll let you walk away.
1288,1288,"You stay in the van, we'll kill all of you, Vogelmann, sidekick number one, sidekick number two, the girl, everybody."
1289,1289,Get the gas.
1290,1290,Teargas?
1291,1291, The gas?
1292,1292, Gasoline.
1293,1293,Don't hold the meeting for me.
1294,1294,I've been delayed.
1295,1295,I don't think the budget is realistic for wheelchair access and metal detectors so we need to provide them both.
1296,1296,"Well, let me just do this thing for Tony and then we can get into it when I get back."
1297,1297,Thanks. Bye.
1298,1298,You got 45 seconds to come out.
1299,1299,woman screams You got 15 seconds.
1300,1300, woman Stop! whimpers  gunshot Looks female but verify.
1301,1301,She's a she.
1302,1302,Mrs. Reed?
1303,1303,What happened to Vogelmann and his sidekicks?
1304,1304,Can you get on the other side of this vehicle?
1305,1305,"Mrs. Reed, did you hear me?"
1306,1306,I'm coming.
1307,1307,"Keep coming, Mrs. Reed."
1308,1308,You're doing great.
1309,1309,You're almost here.
1310,1310,You okay?
1311,1311,Hey.
1312,1312,Stop.
1313,1313,I don't want to see what's under there.
1314,1314,Okay.
1315,1315,That girl was innocent.
1316,1316,Want me to drive you to the emergency room?
1317,1317,"No, it's too much to move."
1318,1318,And there's no reason.
1319,1319,Don't have the right words for this situation.
1320,1320,"God, I really hope that this..."
1321,1321,mistake...
1322,1322,is not what I'm remembered for.
1323,1323,I'll keep your name out of it.
1324,1324, I hope you can.
1325,1325, I will.
1326,1326,Want me to get that?
1327,1327,When she called?
1328,1328,I don't know.
1329,1329,"Well, I'll type for you."
1330,1330, Passcode is...
1331,1331," I know, I know what it is."
1332,1332, Let me hold it.
1333,1333, Yeah.
1334,1334,I'm sorry.
1335,1335,It wasn't what I wanted to hear.
1336,1336,Want me to break it?
1337,1337,Yeah.
1338,1338,Damn!
1339,1339,Damn!
1340,1340,Good?
1341,1341,I'm surrendering.
1342,1342,Taking your deal.
1343,1343,All right.
1344,1344,Come on out with your hands up.
1345,1345,I need...
1346,1346,"Get rid of that gas can, nigga."
1347,1347,I ain't done all this to see you burn up no money.
1348,1348,Gold isn't flammable.
1349,1349,"Yeah, I don't want it melting."
1350,1350,And there's cash in there too.
1351,1351,You wanna come over here and take care of Vogelmann yourself?
1352,1352,"No, nigga. No."
1353,1353,You the professional.
1354,1354,Look at the all good work you've done here.
1355,1355,Can execute naked women and everything.
1356,1356,Prick.
1357,1357,distorted voice Do not prioritize money over having a heartbeat.
1358,1358,The next bullet ain't a warning.
1359,1359,That bulletproof vest you got there's real nice.
1360,1360,Makes you look svelte.
1361,1361,Like when a female puts on a girdle.
1362,1362,It's much more flattering than that windbreaker you wore on the news when you stomped that Mexican.
1363,1363,Where did you spot me?
1364,1364,When you drove by the bank.
1365,1365,And twice when you was following on the parkway.
1366,1366,What do you want?
1367,1367,Stay right there.
1368,1368,So I can thank you face to face for wiping out all these cruelass thugs.
1369,1369,That's what most cops do when they get suspended.
1370,1370,Ridgeman grunts Go rob bank robbers.
1371,1371,Why you taking that off?
1372,1372,I need the strap to stop the bleeding.
1373,1373,'Aight.
1374,1374,I'm gonna ask you some questions.
1375,1375,You tell me some bullshit and I send that video I made of you killing that white girl to the news.
1376,1376,I got a real good angle from up there.
1377,1377,Even got you when you took off your mask.
1378,1378, So ask.
1379,1379, What do the Bulwark PD know...
1380,1380, Nigga.
1381,1381, Likewise.
1382,1382,Let's talk through this.
1383,1383,Make some words.
1384,1384,We should clean up this mess together and split the gold.
1385,1385,"We can fight each other some more, do this until we're crippled or dead, or we can both be rich."
1386,1386,I don't see how this is a dilemma.
1387,1387,"Trusting a cop, one that's crooked as fuck, is the dilemma."
1388,1388,Only thing absolutely certain about you is that you don't give a shit about any oath you swear to.
1389,1389,My daughter got assaulted for the fifth time two days ago.
1390,1390,My wife has multiple sclerosis and can't even walk half the time without a cane.
1391,1391,I need this.
1392,1392, Seventythirty.
1393,1393, Sixtyforty.
1394,1394,'Aight.
1395,1395,There's a getaway car in there?
1396,1396,Detective is astute.
1397,1397,We need to tow this one to the lake.
1398,1398,All right.
1399,1399,Let's unload the guns together and slowly so neither one of us is tempted.
1400,1400,All right.
1401,1401,What we do with our friends?
1402,1402,Can't leave them here.
1403,1403,We can't go bringing them back with us neither without exposing ourselves.
1404,1404,We bury them.
1405,1405,I didn't know they was gonna grab no woman.
1406,1406,Nobody was supposed to get shot unless they pulled a gun on us.
1407,1407,That was the deal.
1408,1408,Did you believe that or did you just want to?
1409,1409,Ain't no guns in here.
1410,1410,A lot of firearms in that van.
1411,1411,Our word's good. It'll be 60/40.
1412,1412,We go in the van at the same time.
1413,1413,Whatever you want.
1414,1414,It's all cotton candy.
1415,1415,It's not gonna smell great in there.
1416,1416,We'll put the gold in here.
1417,1417,Why?
1418,1418,This wreck is dead as an insect.
1419,1419,"Right, but I got to sit in it and steer."
1420,1420,I don't want you cutting me loose and driving off with everything in your trunk.
1421,1421,You're so paranoid and suspicious you're making me paranoid and suspicious.
1422,1422,I'm just trying to avoid temptation.
1423,1423,Detective is a priest.
1424,1424,We go slow.
1425,1425,It's all cotton candy.
1426,1426,Smells like all these dudes shitted themselves.
1427,1427,Don't fondle any guns.
1428,1428,"On Father's Day, does your daughter give you one salute or two?"
1429,1429,She's respectful.
1430,1430,It's all in these duffels.
1431,1431,Yeah.
1432,1432,Some loose bits on the concrete.
1433,1433,âª I'll kiss you when the lights go down âª âª Until the credits rolls âª âª I wish I could do something âª âª To make you feel better âª âª Oh âª âª The doctor said that you don't have much time âª âª No medicine can help you recover âª âª Oh no âª âª But I do know one thing âª âª That will help ease the pain âª That old place is still around âª âª No we won't choose to go âª âª Let me take you âª âª To the drivein âª âª There's a space in the last row âª âª I will show you âª âª A very fine time âª âª I'll kiss you when the lights go down âª âª Till the credits roll âª âª Maybe this night will last forever âª âª Please don't close the drivein âª âª Maybe this night will last forever âª âª Please don't close the drivein âª âª Please don't close the drivein âª âª Please don't close... âª I'll unhook these.
1434,1434,I'll get the bags.
1435,1435,Sorry.
1436,1436,Don't drive too close to that muck.
1437,1437,"You sure you ain't an elementary teacher, used to dealing with little kids who don't know nothing?"
1438,1438,"I believe what you meant to say was, ""Who don't know anything."" You understood me, didn't you?"
1439,1439,"Yeah, but you're a lot smarter than you sound, a whole lot smarter from what I've seen."
1440,1440,It's good to be underestimated.
1441,1441,You're doing that in case I confuse  this car with a submarine?
1442,1442, Yup.
1443,1443,Keep calm.
1444,1444, What the fuck is this shit?
1445,1445, Just a precautionary measure.
1446,1446,I don't intend to hurt you.
1447,1447,Take out your cell phone.
1448,1448,That video is my insurance policy.
1449,1449,Wrong. You can identify me if they toss you in jail.
1450,1450,"If we get brought to trial, I can do the same to you."
1451,1451,We keep each other quiet.
1452,1452,That's fair. That's balanced.
1453,1453,"But that video opens me up to extortion from you, or anyone you send it to, or for anyone that hacks  into your hardware."
1454,1454, None of that's gonna happen.
1455,1455,We 60/40.
1456,1456,I'm just trying to remove temptation.
1457,1457,Get that gun off my neck.
1458,1458,Give me your phone and give me your password.
1459,1459,Get that fucking gun off me.
1460,1460,I don't wanna hurt you but if...
1461,1461,You fucking dumbass.
1462,1462,I wasn't gonna blackmail you.
1463,1463,My word is good.
1464,1464,You should have trusted a nigga.
1465,1465,"All I ever did for this was steal some autos, peddle some blow and put the fool who crippled my brother into intensive."
1466,1466,I ain't never killed nobody.
1467,1467,Damn.
1468,1468,"Bury my friend, please."
1469,1469,I don't want him involved in this.
1470,1470, All right.
1471,1471, Thanks.
1472,1472,You was being true and honest when you said that shit about your baby girl getting attacked and your wife with her mess?
1473,1473,I was being honest.
1474,1474,All right. I'll give them some.
1475,1475,Forty percent.
1476,1476,They ain't getting 40.
1477,1477,But I'll take good care of them.
1478,1478,"Sorry to put you into these, cops, but I can't be finicky right now."
1479,1479,"After all this is finished, forgotten, I'll come back and bury you right."
1480,1480,"Hey, Henry."
1481,1481,"Oh, I could have Christopher finish this in the guest room  if you want."
1482,1482," No problem, Ma."
1483,1483,I know you like to look at the ocean when you get massaged.
1484,1484,Yes.
1485,1485,"Oh, you had some stuff come in the mail while you were gone."
1486,1486,I think it was your broker.
1487,1487,Been up too many hours to look at numbers right now.
1488,1488,Ethan's home or at Jeremy's?
1489,1489,He's in the game room.
1490,1490,All right.
1491,1491,You want sushi for dinner?
1492,1492,I'll make you something homemade if you want.
1493,1493,Thanks.
1494,1494,I would enjoy your cooking.
1495,1495,Your game good?
1496,1496,You done with everything?
1497,1497,Finally.
1498,1498,reporter The victims of the home invasion that occurred in southeast Bulwark Thursday night...
1499,1499,"Hey, sweetie."
1500,1500, There's a package downstairs...
1501,1501," Close the door, please."
1502,1502,No suspect for this violent crime has been apprehended at this time.
1503,1503,The police commissioner has neither confirmed...
1504,1504,I think it's from Dad.
1505,1505,What does the return address say?
1506,1506,It says Ridgeman and a PO Box.
1507,1507,"Let me have it, please."
1508,1508,"Oh, God. This is heavy."
1509,1509, I can help you open it.
1510,1510," Uh, no, no."
1511,1511,"It's addressed to me, and I want to open it myself, in private."
1512,1512," Mom, I wanna..."
1513,1513," Sara, please."
1514,1514,Okay.
1515,1515,I wasn't able to cook tonight so I ordered Chinese.
1516,1516, Okay.
1517,1517, Kiss.
1518,1518,Thank you.
1519,1519,Pause this.
1520,1520,"When I was out mailing that package, I start thinking about that game we was playing right before everything changed for us, the one in the jungle."
1521,1521,You still got it?
1522,1522,Shotgun Safari?
1523,1523,Yeah.
1524,1524,You ready?
1525,1525,Yeah.
1526,1526,Let's hunt some lions.
