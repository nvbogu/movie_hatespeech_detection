0,0,Reynolds has made my dreams come true.
1,1,And I have given him what he desires most in return.
2,2,And what's that?
3,3,Every piece of me.
4,4,"He's a very demanding man, isn't he?"
5,5,Must be quite a challenge to be with him.
6,6,Yes.
7,7,Maybe he's the most demanding man.
8,8,"Morning, ladies."
9,9, Morning.
10,10," Morning, madam."
11,11,"Good morning, ladies."
12,12," Morning, Biddy."
13,13," Morning, Mr. Woodcock."
14,14," Morning, Nana."
15,15," Morning, Mr. Woodcock."
16,16, Pippa.
17,17," Morning, sir."
18,18,Try these.
19,19,Reynolds. They're delicious.
20,20,"Remember I told you, Johannaâ."
21,21,No more stodgy things?
22,22,I didn't know that.
23,23,You may have told it to someone else.
24,24, Morning.
25,25," Morning, my old soandso."
26,26,"Where have you gone, Reynolds?"
27,27,There's nothing I can say to get your attention aimed back at me.
28,28,Is there?
29,29,"I cannot begin my day with a confrontation, please."
30,30,I'm delivering the dress today.
31,31,And I can't take up space with a confrontation.
32,32,I simply don't have time for confrontations.
33,33,"Good morning, Countess."
34,34,"Good morning, Cyril."
35,35,"Good morning, Peter."
36,36,Who is this beautiful stranger?
37,37,"I need to see you far more often, Henrietta."
38,38, I am very excited.
39,39," I am, too. Come in."
40,40,Exquisite.
41,41,Yes?
42,42,Let's take it for a walk.
43,43,"Beautiful work, ladies."
44,44, Thank you very much.
45,45, Thank you.
46,46,"It's beautiful, Reynolds."
47,47,Worth everything we've been through.
48,48,I feel like it will give me courage.
49,49,"Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats, please."
50,50," Evening, Stephen. Is she here?"
51,51," Yes, sir."
52,52,What do you want to do about Johanna?
53,53,"I mean, she's lovely, but the time has come."
54,54,"And she's getting fat, sitting around waiting for you to fall in love with her again."
55,55,I'll give her the October dress.
56,56,If that's all right.
57,57,"I have an unsettled feeling, based on nothing I can put my finger on."
58,58,Just butterflies.
59,59,"Been having the strongest memories of Mama lately, coming to me in my dreams, smelling her scent."
60,60,The strongest sense that she's near us.
61,61,Reaching out towards us.
62,62,I very much hope that she saw the dress tonight. Don't you?
63,63,Yes.
64,64,It's comforting to think the dead are watching over the living.
65,65,I don't find that spooky at all.
66,66,Why don't you go to the country tonight?
67,67,I'll follow tomorrow.
68,68,Good idea.
69,69,I like that idea very much.
70,70,My old soandso.
71,71,Mr. Hansford?
72,72, Mr. Hansford?
73,73, Hello?
74,74, Good morning.
75,75, Morning.
76,76," Fill it up, please."
77,77, I will do.
78,78,Check the oil and the tires.
79,79,Lovely. Thank you.
80,80,It's a hard frost this morning.
81,81,"It's cold, isn't it?"
82,82,It's very bitter.
83,83,Ugh.
84,84,"Excuse me. Could we have a bit more toast, please?"
85,85,Yes.
86,86, Here you are.
87,87, Thank you.
88,88, Good morning.
89,89, Morning.
90,90,What would you like to order?
91,91,A Welsh rarebit...
92,92,"With a poached egg on top, please."
93,93,Not too runny.
94,94,"And bacon, scones, butter, cream, jam, not strawberry."
95,95,No.
96,96,Raspberry?
97,97,What else?
98,98,Coffee or tea?
99,99,Do you have Lapsang?
100,100,"I'll have a pot of Lapsang, please."
101,101,Good choice.
102,102,And some sausages.
103,103,And some sausages.
104,104,Show me.
105,105,Will you remember?
106,106,Yes.
107,107,I'm keeping this.
108,108,And now?
109,109,Will you have dinner with me?
110,110,Yes.
111,111,"For the hungry boy, my name is Alma."
112,112, Am I late?
113,113, No.
114,114,What do you think?
115,115,Hmm.
116,116,I like the sauce.
117,117,Custard.
118,118,It's quite good.
119,119,Mmmhmm.
120,120,"May I, Alma?"
121,121,I like to see who I'm talking to.
122,122,Here.
123,123,Mmm.
124,124,There you are. That's better.
125,125,Does your mother have brown eyes?
126,126,Green.
127,127,Do you look very much like her?
128,128,"I don't know, I think so."
129,129,Do you have a photograph?
130,130,Yes.
131,131, Would you let me see it?
132,132," Not here, at home."
133,133,Carry it with you.
134,134,Always carry her with you.
135,135,Where's yours?
136,136,Your mother.
137,137,She's here in the canvas.
138,138, What do you mean?
139,139, Hmm.
140,140,You can sew almost anything into the canvas of a coat.
141,141,"Secrets, coins, words, little messages."
142,142,"When I was a boy, I started to hide things in the linings of the garments, things that only I knew were there."
143,143,"And over my breast, I have a lock of my mother's hair, to keep her close to me always."
144,144,She was quite a remarkable woman.
145,145,She taught me my trade.
146,146,So I try to never be without her.
147,147,You must love her very much.
148,148,Hello.
149,149,This is Alma. Say hello to Alma.
150,150,Hello.
151,151,This is Alma.
152,152,Come say hello to Alma.
153,153," Come on, come on."
154,154, Hello.
155,155,"Shall we show her the house, lads?"
156,156,I made this dress for her when I was 16 years old.
157,157,It's beautiful.
158,158,"'Twas for her second husband, for the wedding."
159,159,My father had died many years before.
160,160,"Our nanny, the evil Miss Blackwood..."
161,161,"Black Death, we used to call her."
162,162,"Because of superstition, she refused to help me sew the dress, as she believed it would bring her bad fortune, to never be a bride."
163,163,Not that anyone would have had her.
164,164,"And she seemed ancient to us, I have no idea how old she actually was, and monstrously ugly."
165,165,So...
166,166,"I worked alone for months and months, hunched over, sewing and sweating and sewing."
167,167,And the Black Death never married anyway.
168,168,All the help I could have had from her.
169,169,"'Twas my sister, Cyril, came to my rescue in the end."
170,170,There are endless superstitions when making a wedding dress.
171,171,Young girls afraid they'll never marry if they touch one.
172,172,Or models afraid they'll marry only bald men if they put one on.
173,173,And where's the dress now?
174,174,I have no idea what happened to it.
175,175,No idea.
176,176,Most probably turned to ashes by now.
177,177,Fallen to pieces.
178,178,And your sister?
179,179,What?
180,180,Did she ever marry?
181,181,No.
182,182,"C'mon, boys, let's have a fire."
183,183,"If you want to have a staring contest with me, you will lose."
184,184,Hmm.
185,185,Hmm.
186,186,You're a very handsome man.
187,187,You must be around many beautiful women.
188,188,Yes.
189,189,"So, why are you not married?"
190,190,I make dresses.
191,191,You cannot be married when you make dresses?
192,192,I'm certain I was never meant to marry.
193,193,I'm a confirmed bachelor.
194,194,I'm incurable.
195,195,Hmm.
196,196,Marriage would make me deceitful and I don't ever want that.
197,197,You sound so sure about things.
198,198,I'm sure about that.
199,199,I think you're only acting strong.
200,200,"No, lam strong."
201,201,"For who? Not for me, I hope."
202,202,I think it's the expectations and assumptions of others that cause heartache.
203,203,Would you help me with something?
204,204, Yes.
205,205, Come on.
206,206,Good. Just jump up on the box for me.
207,207,I think we're going to try and pull this back for you.
208,208,Pretty good.
209,209,One moment.
210,210,We'll save that one for another time.
211,211,Quite nice.
212,212,"But, um..."
213,213,Mmm.
214,214,Bit serious.
215,215,This one.
216,216,Do you like it?
217,217, Yes.
218,218, It's very good.
219,219,That's it.
220,220,"Let's get that off you, and then I'd like to take your measurements."
221,221,Is that all right?
222,222,And who's this lovely creature making the house smell so nice?
223,223,"Hello, I'm Alma."
224,224,I'm Cyril.
225,225,Sandalwood and rose water.
226,226,"Mmm. Sherry, and..."
227,227,Lemon juice?
228,228,Mmm. Mmmhmm.
229,229,We had fish for dinner.
230,230,My old soandso.
231,231,Would you mind?
232,232,Can you step towards me? Ready?
233,233,Thirtytwo.
234,234,Thirty.
235,235,Thirtyone.
236,236,Thirtyfive and a half.
237,237,Fourteen and a half...
238,238,Seventeen...
239,239,Twenty.
240,240, Can you just stand normally?
241,241, Yes.
242,242, I stand normally.
243,243, Like before.
244,244, What do you mean?
245,245, Straight.
246,246, Straight.
247,247, Like that.
248,248,"Yeah, you didn't say that."
249,249,Sixteen and a half.
250,250,Eight and a half.
251,251,You have no breasts.
252,252,Twentytwo.
253,253," Yes, I know."
254,254, Thirtytwo and a half.
255,255,You can drop your arm now.
256,256, I'm sorry.
257,257," No, no, you're perfect."
258,258,"My job to give you some, if I choose to."
259,259,Ten.
260,260,Nine.
261,261,Six and a half.
262,262,Twentyfive.
263,263,And 45. That's it.
264,264, Would you try something else for me?
265,265, Yes.
266,266,You have the ideal shape.
267,267, I do?
268,268, Mmmhmm.
269,269,He likes a little belly.
270,270,I never really liked myself.
271,271,"I thought my shoulders were too wide, my neck was skinny like a bird, that I had no breasts."
272,272,"I felt my hips were larger than needed, and my arms too strong."
273,273,I feel as if I've been looking for you for a very long time.
274,274,You found me.
275,275,"Whatever you do, do it carefully."
276,276,"But in his work, I become perfect."
277,277,And I feel just right.
278,278,"Good evening, Mr. Woodcock, sir."
279,279,Maybe that's how all women feel in his clothes.
280,280,"You look beautiful, really."
281,281,Very beautiful.
282,282,You're making me extremely hungry.
283,283, Thank you.
284,284, I ordered you a steak tartare.
285,285,"Oh, perfect. Thank you."
286,286,My little carnivore.
287,287,I've just been on the telephone to your favorite client.
288,288,Mmmhmm.
289,289,Barbara Rose is getting married again.
290,290,"Oh, goody."
291,291,All right. Well...
292,292,Think I'd better have another one of these.
293,293,That's your room.
294,294,I'm right next door.
295,295,Get your rest.
296,296,We'll start early in the morning.
297,297,How early?
298,298,I'll wake you.
299,299,Good night.
300,300,Good night.
301,301,"Sometimes we wake up at 4:00 in the morning, after we've gone to bed at midnight."
302,302,And then he's ready to start again.
303,303,And I can stand endlessly.
304,304,No one can stand as long as I can.
305,305,"What is it, Alma?"
306,306,"What are you looking so forlorn about, hmm?"
307,307,"I don't know, I..."
308,308,I think I don't like the fabric so much.
309,309,"Well, Alma, this fabric is adored by the women who wear our design."
310,310,It's perfect for this dress.
311,311,Cyril is right.
312,312,Cyril is always right.
313,313,It's not because the fabric is adored by the clients that Cyril is right.
314,314,It's right because it's right.
315,315,Because it's beautiful.
316,316,"Maybe one day you'll change your taste, Alma."
317,317,Maybe not.
318,318,Maybe you have no taste.
319,319,Maybe I like my own taste.
320,320,"Yes, just enough to get you into trouble."
321,321, Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.
322,322, Stop!
323,323,"You know, at the big races and the Derby and, uh, thoseâ."
324,324, Yes?
325,325," Excuse me, Mr. Woodcock."
326,326,I would like to say that I hope one day I could wear one of your dresses.
327,327,"Oh, thank you."
328,328,"If that's your wish, I hope it comes true for you."
329,329,She really means it.
330,330,She told me she wants to be buried in a dress that you make.
331,331,Hmm.
332,332, Thank you.
333,333," Thank you, ladies, for your kind words."
334,334,Good night.
335,335, Thank you.
336,336, Thank you!
337,337, Good night. Thank you very much.
338,338, Good night.
339,339,"You'd dig her up and sell the dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?"
340,340,"Well, otherwise it would seem to be going to a waste, but, yeah, I mean, one but can try."
341,341,"Nigel, why aren't you eating your profiteroles?"
342,342,What?
343,343,Have you had enough to eat?
344,344,You seem thirsty.
345,345,"Morning, Reynolds."
346,346,Mmmhmm.
347,347," Morning, Cyril."
348,348,"Please, don't move so much, Alma."
349,349,"I'm buttering my toast, I'm not moving too much."
350,350,"Well, it's too much."
351,351,"It's a distraction, it's very distracting."
352,352,Maybe you pay too much attention to it.
353,353,It's hard to ignore.
354,354,It's as if you just rode a horse across the room.
355,355,This is too much movement.
356,356,It is entirely too much movement at breakfast.
357,357,Perhaps you should take your breakfast after him.
358,358,Or in your room.
359,359,I think he's being too fussy.
360,360,"His routine, when he's in it, is best not shaken."
361,361, Well...
362,362," This is a quiet time, not to be misused."
363,363,"If breakfast isn't right, it's very hard for him to recover for the rest of the day."
364,364,I didn't know that.
365,365,"No, of course you didn't."
366,366,But you do now.
367,367,Still I think he's too fussy.
368,368,"Well, that's as may be."
369,369,This is Flemish bobbin lace from the late 1600s.
370,370,"It's very rare, very precious."
371,371,I rescued it from Antwerp during the war.
372,372,I've been waiting for the right moment to...
373,373,To make something with it.
374,374,Hold it.
375,375, That's very nice. That's beautiful.
376,376, That's good.
377,377, Best yet. Beautiful.
378,378, Very nice. Turn towards the light.
379,379,"Um, just look towards the window, please, Alma."
380,380,"Amber, could you just lift the bodice, a little bit?"
381,381,It keeps dropping down.
382,382,We need to get that adjusted properly.
383,383,It's ridiculous.
384,384, Just get it fixed.
385,385," Yes, sir."
386,386,"Should've been ready today, quite honestly."
387,387,Keep your eye on that.
388,388, Together.
389,389, I'm not sitting on the floor.
390,390,Sit on the floor.
391,391,You're lovely.
392,392,"Ah, it's great."
393,393,That's great.
394,394,"Okay, hold that while I change the film."
395,395,Have I finished yet?
396,396,"All right, that's it."
397,397,I need to do some work.
398,398,Hell.
399,399,Yes?
400,400,May I come in?
401,401,I'm working.
402,402,Do you need anything?
403,403,It's fabulous on the shoulders.
404,404,"Shoulder drapes, and then you can put it on completely."
405,405,Okay?
406,406,"Good, good, good."
407,407,Alma? Is she ready?
408,408,Nearly.
409,409,"Come on, please."
410,410,Mmmhmm.
411,411,Ingrid.
412,412,"Uh, cape's wrong."
413,413,Let me do it.
414,414,Let me do it.
415,415,"Ellie, you ready?"
416,416,Let's have a look at you.
417,417,"Stand here, please."
418,418,Mmm.
419,419,All right.
420,420,"Off you go. Thank you, Pippa."
421,421,"Ingrid, you ready?"
422,422,"Let me do it, let me do it."
423,423,Damn it.
424,424,"You're no good to me just standing there, Pippa!"
425,425, I need your hands on this.
426,426," Sorry, sir. Sorry. Yes."
427,427,"Just go. Go, go!"
428,428,I'm sorry.
429,429,Let me drive for you.
430,430,"You see, when you..."
431,431,When you love your work and you can give like he does...
432,432,You need to come down again.
433,433,And then he's...
434,434,He's a baby.
435,435,Like a spoiled little baby.
436,436,"When he's like this, he's very tender."
437,437,Open.
438,438,How long will these episodes last?
439,439,"Only a few days, and then he's well again."
440,440," No. Alma, what are you doing?"
441,441, There's tea for you.
442,442,"Don't put the tray on the table, please."
443,443,Just take it off.
444,444,I didn't ask for tea.
445,445,"No, but..."
446,446,"Can you take it out, please?"
447,447,"Yes, I can take it out."
448,448," It's a bit late now, isn't it?"
449,449, I'm taking it out.
450,450,"Yeah, but it's a bit late now, isn't it?"
451,451,But I'm taking it out.
452,452,"The tea is going out, the interruption is staying right here with me."
453,453,What if they are yellow underneath and white on top?
454,454,The poison ones have gills.
455,455,Look at the book in the kitchen.
456,456,We cook them in fat?
457,457,"No, we'll cook them in butter."
458,458,But not too much.
459,459,Mr. Woodcock detests too much butter.
460,460,There's a very good chance Barbara Rose will ask you to attend her wedding.
461,461,What do you want me to do with that?
462,462,Accept her invitation.
463,463,If you can stomach it.
464,464,"I really wish I hadn't heard this till later on, Cyril."
465,465,It's very unsettling.
466,466,"Well, chin up."
467,467,Barbara Rose pays for this house.
468,468,All right?
469,469,"Morning, Barbara."
470,470,"Morning, Cal."
471,471,"Morning, Tippy."
472,472," Good morning,  Mr. Woodcock."
473,473,Reynolds.
474,474,Let's get started.
475,475,Put it in there.
476,476,Thank you.
477,477,"I'm just going to lift this up, Barbara."
478,478,Oh.
479,479,I know you're doing the best you can.
480,480,Don't do that.
481,481," Take your hand away, please."
482,482, I'm still so ugly.
483,483,"Barbara, I'm trying to make you a beautiful dress."
484,484,I need your help.
485,485,"Uh, please."
486,486,"Reynolds, will you come?"
487,487,"Just stand still, please."
488,488,"It's really not my place, Barbara."
489,489,This is what I do.
490,490,"This is my place, here."
491,491,I'm afraid I must insist that you come.
492,492,"George Riley, News of the World."
493,493, Who'll be the attendant at the wedding?
494,494," My son, Cal."
495,495,"My Cal, my son."
496,496,"He's so wonderful, he's so in favor of this marriage."
497,497,"John Evans, Daily Mail."
498,498,"And what of your holdings, Miss Rose?"
499,499,Do they become Dominican property?
500,500," I don't know, I don't think so."
501,501," If I may say, we are being married under Dominican law, but in my country, her money belongs to her and my money belongs to me."
502,502,"Anyway, why would I need her money?"
503,503,I have enough of my own.
504,504,What's Barbara brought into your life?
505,505,I brought sincerity into his life.
506,506, Sincerity?
507,507, Then one kiss for the cameras.
508,508,"Go on, give us a kiss for the cameras, Miss Rose."
509,509,The answer to the question  is sincerity.
510,510, Let's give them a kiss...
511,511,"Rubio, tell us about selling visas to the Jews during the war."
512,512,Thank you.
513,513,Visas? Jews?
514,514," Thank you very much, gentlemen."
515,515, Thank you for that.
516,516,"Jews, visas?"
517,517,That dress doesn't belong here.
518,518, Don't start crying.
519,519, I'm not crying.
520,520,I'm angry.
521,521," Well, don't start blubbering, Alma."
522,522, I'm not blubbering.
523,523,She doesn't deserve it.
524,524,It's your work.
525,525,Come on.
526,526,Tippy?
527,527,Mr. Woodcock.
528,528, What is it?
529,529, I would like the dress back.
530,530,Miss Rose is sleeping.
531,531,"Well, that's got nothing to do with the dress."
532,532,"Can you go and get it for me, please?"
533,533,She's sleeping.
534,534,In the dress?
535,535,"Well, yes."
536,536,Go and take the dress off her and bring it to me right away.
537,537, I don't think so.
538,538, Take the fucking dress off Barbara and bring it to me or I'll do it myself!
539,539,I beg your pardon?
540,540,Alma.
541,541," Hello, Mr. Woodcock."
542,542, Cal.
543,543,I...
544,544,It's no business of ours what Mrs. Rose decides to do with her life.
545,545,But she can no longer behave like this and be dressed by the House of Woodcock.
546,546,Thank you.
547,547,I love you.
548,548, Pedigree. That's for mother.
549,549, Racy.
550,550,"Uh, she'd like something like that, but..."
551,551," Thank you, dear."
552,552, It's Mona's day.
553,553," Yes, it is."
554,554, So I'd like to wear something for her.
555,555," Yes, of course."
556,556, She mentioned that last time.
557,557, Did she?
558,558, Yeah.
559,559, Did she really?
560,560, Yeah.
561,561,All right.
562,562, Julie.
563,563," Yes, sir."
564,564, Do we have porridge?
565,565," Yes, we do."
566,566," Um, do we have cream?"
567,567," We do, yes."
568,568, Thick cream?
569,569," Oh, yes."
570,570,"That's what I'd like for breakfast, please."
571,571," All right, sir."
572,572, Don't forget the salt this time.
573,573," I shan't, I shan't."
574,574," Oh, Alma, would you like some porridge..."
575,575, Yes.
576,576, This morning?
577,577," Some for Alma as well, please."
578,578, Right away.
579,579," And, um, bacon and eggs with that."
580,580," All right, sir."
581,581,Morning.
582,582,I'm so hungry.
583,583,Delighted that we have cream in the house.
584,584, Yes.
585,585, Makes all the difference.
586,586,It's essential with porridge.
587,587,A little bit naughty though.
588,588, Dear Reynolds.
589,589, Your Royal Highness.
590,590, Hello.
591,591, How beautiful you are.
592,592, How nice to see you again.
593,593, Your Royal Highness.
594,594, Cyril!
595,595, Your Highness.
596,596, Hello.
597,597, How lovely to see you.
598,598,Good morning.
599,599,"When you dream about your wedding dress, what is it that you dream?"
600,600,I dream that it's the most beautiful wedding dress in the world.
601,601,Naturally.
602,602,Perhaps the only wedding dress in the world.
603,603,Yes.
604,604,"Or to take it just a little step further, perhaps the only wedding dress that was ever made."
605,605,Oui.
606,606,Is Your Royal Highness a gold person or a silver person?
607,607, Silver.
608,608, Good.
609,609,Lace or pearl?
610,610,Lace.
611,611,Very good.
612,612,Merci.
613,613,I want to wish you good fortune for your wedding.
614,614,Thank you.
615,615,Je m'appelle Alma.
616,616,"Lovely to meet you, Alma."
617,617,I live here.
618,618,Come in.
619,619,Alma.
620,620,"Good morning, Cyril."
621,621,I wanted to ask your help in a gift I wanted to make for Reynolds.
622,622,I want to make him a surprise.
623,623,"If everyone left the house when he takes his walk on Thursday, I will cook for him, dinner."
624,624,"And when he comes back, no one will be there but me."
625,625,"I'll be waiting for him, I will surprise him and we can have dinner together, just the two of us."
626,626,Do you like this idea?
627,627,Would you help me?
628,628,It isn't his birthday.
629,629,I know.
630,630,"I would advise against this, Alma."
631,631, Why?
632,632, Because he doesn't like surprises.
633,633, He does.
634,634," Well, he won't like this one."
635,635,I'm trying to surprise him and love him the way that I want to.
636,636,"Well, if you're looking for something kind to do, perhaps you could think of something else."
637,637,"No, I really must advise against this, Alma."
638,638,I don't think there could be a more inappropriate time to try something new.
639,639,"This is what I want to do, and I think it will be very nice."
640,640,"I respect your advice, Cyril."
641,641,"But I have to know him in my own way, and this is what I want to do for him."
642,642,Good night.
643,643, Good night.
644,644," Good night, madame."
645,645,"Good night, madame."
646,646,Good luck.
647,647,"Oh, Alma. What is this?"
648,648,"I love you, Reynolds."
649,649,"Yes, but what is this?"
650,650,It's a surprise.
651,651,Are you hungry?
652,652,Where is Cyril?
653,653,I've sent everyone home.
654,654,Where is Cyril?
655,655,She's left.
656,656,What time did she leave?
657,657,This afternoon.
658,658,I've made us dinner.
659,659,Let me collect myself for a moment.
660,660,"I'll just have a bath, I think."
661,661,"This is very kind of you, Alma."
662,662, Would you like a champagne or a martini?
663,663," No, thank you."
664,664,"Oh, is that your dress?"
665,665,It's finished.
666,666,Let's have a look at it.
667,667,Hmm.
668,668,It's rather interesting.
669,669,Very good work.
670,670,I'll just have my bath now.
671,671,When will Cyril get back?
672,672,"Mmm, tonight?"
673,673,How was your appointment with the princess?
674,674,"She's very beautiful, like a sculpture of some kind."
675,675,Mmmhmm.
676,676,So will you make her a wedding gown?
677,677,"I have made her baptism, her First Communion and confirmation dresses."
678,678,"I made the dress for her presentation at court, indeed the entire wardrobe for her coming out season."
679,679,"It's only right that I should make her wedding dress, wouldn't you think?"
680,680, Christ.
681,681, No.
682,682,But this is not what I wanted to say.
683,683,"I'm sorry, I don't know what I said, I..."
684,684,This is meant to be a nice evening.
685,685,Let me serve you.
686,686,Do you like it?
687,687,I do.
688,688,"No, you don't."
689,689,You don't like it at all.
690,690,"Usually, you always tell me what you think."
691,691,What is this?
692,692,You're lying.
693,693,"As I think you know, Alma, I prefer my asparagus with oil and salt."
694,694,"And knowing this, you've prepared the asparagus with butter."
695,695,"Now, I can imagine in certain circumstances being able to pretend that I like it made this way."
696,696,"Right now, I'm just admiring my own gallantry for eating it the way you've prepared it."
697,697,I don't know what I'm doing here.
698,698,I don't know what I'm doing here.
699,699,I'm just waiting around like an idiot for you.
700,700,"This was an ambush, Alma."
701,701,To what purpose?
702,702,This is not...
703,703,I know it's not going as I expected.
704,704,I didn't mean these things to come out.
705,705,"I'm sorry, but it was meant to be nice."
706,706,"Well, what did you expect?"
707,707,I wanted time with you. I wanted to have you to myself.
708,708, You have me all the time.
709,709, No.
710,710, What on earth are you talking about?
711,711, I don't!
712,712,There are always people around.
713,713,"And if not, then there's something between us."
714,714, Something between us?
715,715, Yes.
716,716, What?
717,717, Some...
718,718, What?
719,719, Distance!
720,720,When did this happen?
721,721,What happened to make you behave like this?
722,722,Is it because you think I don't need you?
723,723, Yes.
724,724, I don't.
725,725,"Well, that's very predictable of you."
726,726,Don't act so tough.
727,727,I know you are not.
728,728,"Yeah, that's right. That's right."
729,729,If I don't protect myself somebody will come in the middle of the night and take over my corner of the room and ask me about their fucking asparagus!
730,730, Don't be a bully. You're being a bully.
731,731, There are other things  I'd like to do with my time. It's my time!
732,732, I have no idea  what I'm doing here in your time!
733,733, My time!
734,734,What am I doing here?
735,735,I'm standing around like an idiot waiting for you!
736,736, Waiting for what?
737,737, Waiting for you.
738,738,Waiting for what?
739,739,Waiting for you to get rid of me.
740,740,To tell me to leave.
741,741,So tell me.
742,742,So I don't stand around like a fucking fool.
743,743,"Asparagus, is this all about your asparagus?"
744,744," No, it's not about asparagus."
745,745, Then what the hell is it about?
746,746,Are you a special agent sent here to ruin my evening and possibly my entire life?
747,747,Why are you so rude to me?
748,748, Why are you talking to me like this?
749,749, Is this my house?
750,750," This is my house, isn't it?"
751,751," Yes, this is your house."
752,752, Is this my house?
753,753, Of course it's your house.
754,754, Or did somebody drop me on foreign soil.
755,755, What a question!
756,756,Behind enemy lines?
757,757, It's you who brought me here.
758,758, I'm surrounded on all sides.
759,759,It's you who brought me here.
760,760,When the hell did this happen?
761,761,Who are you?
762,762,Do you have a gun?
763,763,You here to kill me?
764,764, Why are you...
765,765, Do you have a gun?
766,766, Stop it!
767,767, Where's your gun?
768,768, Stop being a child.
769,769, Where's your gun?
770,770, Stop playing.
771,771, Show me your gun.
772,772,Stop playing this game!
773,773, I am not.
774,774, I'm not playing a game.
775,775, Yes. Mmmhmm. Uhhuh.
776,776, What game am I playing?
777,777,What game? What precisely is the nature of my game?
778,778, You tell me.
779,779," Oh, this whole..."
780,780, What?
781,781, All your rules and your walls and your doors and your people and your money and all these clothes and everything!
782,782,"This, this, this game!"
783,783,Everything here!
784,784,The whole... Pfft!
785,785,Nothing is normal or natural or...
786,786,Everything is a game!
787,787,"""Yes, mister!"
788,788,"No, madam! Yes."" Well..."
789,789, if it's my...
790,790," ""I don't eat this. I don't drink that."
791,791," ""I don't...""  If it's my life that you're describing, it's entirely up to you whether you choose to share it or not."
792,792,"If you don't wish to share that life, as apparently it's so disagreeable to you in every respect, why don't you just fuck off to back where you came from?"
793,793,Yeah.
794,794,Sometimes it's good for him to slow down his steps a little.
795,795,Would you like me to ask Alma to leave?
796,796,No. Why?
797,797,"Well, if you're going to make her a ghost, go ahead and do it."
798,798,"But, please, don't let her sit around waiting for you."
799,799,I'm very fond of her.
800,800,"Oh, you're very fond of her, are you? In that case..."
801,801,"No, don't turn it on me. I don't want your cloud on my head."
802,802," Oh, shut up, Cyril."
803,803," No, you can shut right up."
804,804,"Don't pick a fight with me, you certainly won't come out alive."
805,805,I'll go right through you and it'll be you who ends up on the floor.
806,806,Understood?
807,807," Morning, Pippa."
808,808," Morning, sir."
809,809," Pen, book and glasses?"
810,810," Yes, they're all there for you, sir."
811,811," Morning, ladies."
812,812," Good morning, sir."
813,813,"Excellent work, ladies. Um..."
814,814,"It's just not very good, is it?"
815,815,It's ugly.
816,816,"You all right, sir?"
817,817,Reynolds?
818,818,"Reynolds, are you all right?"
819,819,"Mr. Woodcock, he seems to be ill."
820,820,Who seems to be ill?
821,821,"Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over and he's damaged the dress."
822,822,"I'm sorry, Biddy."
823,823,Who's fallen over?
824,824,"Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over and he's damaged the dress."
825,825,There's stains on the front of the skirt and there's a hole in the lace on the bodice and there's shoe polish on the front of the dress.
826,826,Shoe polish from what?
827,827,From his shoe.
828,828,I'm fine.
829,829,"Oh, I don't know what the hell came over me."
830,830,Must be something I've eaten.
831,831,Mmmhmm.
832,832,"Oh, God."
833,833, You should lie down now.
834,834," No, I'll be fine in a minute."
835,835, Please lie down.
836,836," No, really, don't fuss, Alma, please."
837,837,Just don't fuss.
838,838,"Whatever it is, if you fuss, I'll die right here."
839,839,I promise I won't fuss.
840,840,"Let me do that, please."
841,841, I have to take these off.
842,842," Yes, I'll take them off."
843,843,Alma? Alma?
844,844,Yes?
845,845,Um...
846,846,Would you tell them I'll be down shortly?
847,847,"Yes, of course."
848,848,"Hello, Cyril."
849,849,Hello.
850,850,What is it?
851,851,I don't know what the bloody hell came over me.
852,852,I'll be all right in a moment.
853,853,"Oh, you don't look all right."
854,854,Where does it hurt?
855,855,Hurts all over.
856,856,I've never really felt like this before.
857,857,Is it your stomach?
858,858,Is it something you've eaten?
859,859,"No, I don't think so."
860,860,"Just sore, really."
861,861,So please tell them I'll be with them in a minute.
862,862,"No, you're not going anywhere."
863,863,You're to stay here and rest.
864,864,Would you like me to do anything?
865,865,Just give me silence.
866,866, Shall I call the doctor?
867,867," No, Cyril, you certainly will not, please."
868,868, All right.
869,869, Um...
870,870, Exhausted yourself.
871,871, Just give me silence.
872,872, Burning up.
873,873, You take care of the dress for me.
874,874,"Yes, of course I will."
875,875,It's all right.
876,876,I just...
877,877,I just want...
878,878,That's it.
879,879,"Come on, Alma."
880,880,I think I may be sick again.
881,881,"We're gonna have to do a lot of work to get this dress ready for tomorrow, you know."
882,882,We're gonna have to undo the front of the dress and replace the skirt.
883,883,We're gonna have to cut a new panel of the satin and then there's also the organza that needs to be...
884,884,"Yes, I'll deal with that in a minute, Biddy. Thank you."
885,885,You're soaked. We need to change your pajamas.
886,886,"I'm scared, Alma."
887,887,"Yes, of course you are."
888,888,Do you think I'll ever get better?
889,889,Of course.
890,890,I'll take care of you.
891,891,"Madam, there's a telephone call."
892,892,"He's settled now, sleeping."
893,893, The doctor's here.
894,894, What doctor?
895,895,The doctor I sent for.
896,896," Oh, no, but he doesn't..."
897,897, He needs to be examined.
898,898, No.
899,899, Yes!
900,900,"No, he's not dying."
901,901,He needs to be examined.
902,902,He's sleeping now.
903,903,That's what he needs.
904,904,Let me be unambiguous.
905,905,Come out of the room and downstairs immediately.
906,906,All right.
907,907,"Alma, this is Dr. Hardy."
908,908,"How do you do, Mrs. Woodcock?"
909,909,How do you do?
910,910,How's he feeling?
911,911,He's better.
912,912,He's sleeping.
913,913,Is he able to keep anything down yet?
914,914,He hasn't tried yet.
915,915,"Uh, I was going to make some soup."
916,916,And his fever?
917,917,It has gone down.
918,918," Uh, would you like me to see him?"
919,919, Yes.
920,920," Is that all right, Mrs. Woodcock?"
921,921," Yes, it is!"
922,922,"Reynolds, Lady Baltimore has sent her godson to see you."
923,923,Dr. Hardy.
924,924,"Hello, Mr. Woodcock."
925,925,May I examine you?
926,926,Keep your hands off me.
927,927, I'd just like to take your temperature.
928,928," Alma, there's a strange boy in the room."
929,929,"Can you get him out, please?"
930,930," I admit I do look young, but I..."
931,931, Fuck off.
932,932,"Reynolds, please, just let him examine you."
933,933,"Yes, fuck off."
934,934, I think this is clear.
935,935, Hmm.
936,936,He wants you to fuck off.
937,937,"I'm so sorry, Doctor."
938,938, I'm very sorry.
939,939, Not to worry.
940,940,I'll drop by tomorrow morning to see how he's coming along.
941,941, 9:00 a.m.?
942,942, Yes.
943,943,"If his fever increases during the night, you'll telephone me?"
944,944,"Of course, Doctor."
945,945," Good night, Mrs. Woodcock."
946,946," Good night, Doctor."
947,947,Follow me.
948,948,When will it be ready?
949,949,I don't know.
950,950,Let me put it another way.
951,951,This dress will be ready by 9:00 a.m.
952,952,because that's when it leaves for Belgium.
953,953,"Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to work late this evening."
954,954,The dress needs to be ready by 9:00 a.m.
955,955,to make its journey to Belgium.
956,956,Do expect to be here for quite some time.
957,957,"If you need to use the telephone, please use the one in my office..."
958,958, Nana and Biddy...
959,959, ...to alert your families.
960,960,What can I do to help?
961,961,"Could you pin the ribbon on the hem there, please? Thank you."
962,962,"Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to work late this evening."
963,963,The dress needs to be ready by 9:00 a.m.
964,964,and I know there's rather a lot to do on it still.
965,965,So please do expect to be here possibly for most of the night.
966,966,"If you need to make telephone calls, do so from my office. Thank you."
967,967,Are you here?
968,968,Are you always here?
969,969,I miss you.
970,970,I think about you all the time.
971,971,I hear your voice say my name when I dream.
972,972,"Then when I wake up, there are tears streaming down my face."
973,973,"I just miss you, it's as simple as that."
974,974,I want to tell you everything.
975,975,I don't understand what you're saying.
976,976,I can't hear your voice.
977,977,Your fever's gone down.
978,978,"I love you, Alma."
979,979,I don't ever want to be without you.
980,980,I love you.
981,981,I have things I want to do.
982,982,I had thought my days were unlimited.
983,983,"The mistakes I've made and made again, they can no longer be ignored."
984,984,There are things nagging at me.
985,985,Things that now must be done.
986,986,Things I simply cannot do without you.
987,987,To keep my sour heart from choking.
988,988,To break a curse.
989,989,A house that doesn't change is a dead house.
990,990,"Alma, will you marry me?"
991,991,Will you marry me?
992,992,What the bloody hell are you thinking about?
993,993,Will you marry me?
994,994,No?
995,995,Yes.
996,996,Will you marry me?
997,997,"Yes, I will."
998,998,"Reynolds to Alma, when you say these binding and contracting words, you'll be looking at each other."
999,999,"After all, it is each other you are marrying and not me."
1000,1000,Reynolds... I call upon these persons here present...
1001,1001,I call upon these persons here present...
1002,1002,"To witness that I, Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock..."
1003,1003,"Do take thee, Alma Elson..."
1004,1004,"Do take thee, Alma Elson..."
1005,1005,To be my lawful wedded wife...
1006,1006,To be my lawful wedded wife.
1007,1007,Alma... I call upon these persons here present...
1008,1008,I call upon these persons here present...
1009,1009,"To witness that I, Alma Elson..."
1010,1010,"To witness that I, Alma Elson..."
1011,1011,"Do take thee, Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock..."
1012,1012,"Do take thee, Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock..."
1013,1013,To be my lawful wedded husband.
1014,1014,To be my lawful wedded husband.
1015,1015,And it now gives me great pleasure to say...
1016,1016,Congratulations.
1017,1017,You are now husband and wife.
1018,1018,And you may kiss the bride.
1019,1019, An hour?
1020,1020," Uh, an hour? That's okay."
1021,1021,Cuckoo.
1022,1022, I'll see you later.
1023,1023, See you later.
1024,1024, Have a good time.
1025,1025," You, too."
1026,1026,"You, too, have a good time."
1027,1027,"Not for me, thank you."
1028,1028,Dr. Hardy?
1029,1029, Dr. Hardy?
1030,1030," Oh! Hey. Sorry, excuse me."
1031,1031,"Reynolds, do you remember Dr. Hardy?"
1032,1032," Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Woodcock."
1033,1033," Oh, hello."
1034,1034,"How do you do, Mr. Woodcock?"
1035,1035,How are you feeling?
1036,1036,"I think we met in a puddle of sweat, didn't we?"
1037,1037,"Yes, that's right."
1038,1038,I probably owe you an apology of some kind.
1039,1039, I seem to remember barking at you.
1040,1040, There's no need.
1041,1041, I've been laid siege by much worse.
1042,1042," Oh, really?"
1043,1043,You look very healthy.
1044,1044,How are you feeling?
1045,1045,Didn't I tell you to fuck off?
1046,1046,"Yes. Yes, you did."
1047,1047,"Dinner is served, everybody!"
1048,1048,Come along.
1049,1049,That's your shiftyeyed godson?
1050,1050,Shiftyeyed?
1051,1051,He's got perfectly normal eyes.
1052,1052,"I'm rather less fat, I think, than when you last saw me."
1053,1053, Really?
1054,1054, Yes.
1055,1055,Thank you very much indeed.
1056,1056,It's fallen off me.
1057,1057,Ooh! I'm so sorry.
1058,1058,...there are secrets nobody tells.
1059,1059,Your wife has got that gorgeous glow you get with a first marriage.
1060,1060,How long will you be here for?
1061,1061,Seems my godson's rather enjoying that glow as well.
1062,1062,"So, what are your plans for New Year's Eve?"
1063,1063,"Oh, um..."
1064,1064,We don't have any.
1065,1065,"Well, you should come out for the Chelsea Arts Club Ball."
1066,1066, I don't know what that is.
1067,1067, It's not something I'd suggest if I didn't think you'd have a wonderful time.
1068,1068,It's really something to be seen.
1069,1069,I'll pass it on to my husband.
1070,1070,But I think we'll stay in.
1071,1071,Change your mind.
1072,1072,"Or get him to change his mind, or whatever it takes."
1073,1073,"Now, please come. I promise you the time of your life."
1074,1074,How do you know how my life has been?
1075,1075,I don't.
1076,1076,You're right.
1077,1077,"I think this would be quite a fine time, if you'd like to come."
1078,1078,"She's barely looked at you this evening, has she?"
1079,1079,I think they're well and truly shaken now.
1080,1080,What on earth are you doing?
1081,1081, I rolled a three.
1082,1082," Yes, but that's the four pip."
1083,1083, Go back to the bar where you belong.
1084,1084," Oh, sorry."
1085,1085,"Let's not start cheating at this stage, Alma."
1086,1086,I'm not cheating.
1087,1087,I don't need to cheat.
1088,1088,"Oh, good. You do need to be able to count, on the other hand."
1089,1089,"Backgammon, by the way, I get treble the score because you haven't gotten any checkers off the board."
1090,1090,Oh.
1091,1091,Stupid game anyway.
1092,1092,"Well, maybe it seems stupid to you now as you're currently losing, but I dare say if you were victorious, I'm confident you'd see it in a different light."
1093,1093,"Now, they need your chair for my next opponent. Next."
1094,1094,"Me, please."
1095,1095,What? What are you so cranky about?
1096,1096,Have fun with your next opponent.
1097,1097,"Why, I think I will, a lot more than I did with you."
1098,1098,"Gosh. She's really very rude, isn't she?"
1099,1099,My heart breaks for you.
1100,1100,"Oh, really?"
1101,1101,Being married to a toddler.
1102,1102,"I don't want to be racist, but, I mean, is there some sort of custom at this time of the night in her country, where..."
1103,1103," I mean, what's she doing?"
1104,1104, Where what?
1105,1105,"I don't know. I don't know if she's up stealing things or attacking people, I mean..."
1106,1106,I want to go dancing.
1107,1107,When?
1108,1108,Right now.
1109,1109, You're joking.
1110,1110," No, I'm not."
1111,1111,It's New Year's Eve.
1112,1112,"Well, I'm not going dancing."
1113,1113,There's a party at the Devonshire Hall to celebrate the New Year and I want to go.
1114,1114,We need to go dancing.
1115,1115,So what are you going to do about it?
1116,1116,I'm going to stay right here and I'm going to work.
1117,1117,"On the hour, ladies and gentlemen!"
1118,1118,"Are you ready to welcome in our lovely, glorious, Happy New Year?"
1119,1119,Are you ready?
1120,1120,Here we go!
1121,1121,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!"
1122,1122,Happy New Year!
1123,1123,How does it feel?
1124,1124,"Well, I think it feels a little big."
1125,1125,Shall we just take it in on the waist?
1126,1126,We can take it in a little on the waist.
1127,1127, Yes.
1128,1128," Yes, okay. Just take it out."
1129,1129,How's that feeling?
1130,1130,I think that's better.
1131,1131,"Would you excuse me for a minute, please, Mrs. Vaughan?"
1132,1132,Where has Henrietta Harding been?
1133,1133, She's been to another house.
1134,1134, Which one?
1135,1135, Why didn't you tell me?
1136,1136, Because I didn't want to.
1137,1137,Is there something I'm unaware of?
1138,1138,"Because as far as I can remember, all I have done is to dress her beautifully."
1139,1139,I don't think that matters to some people.
1140,1140,I think they want what is fashionable and chic.
1141,1141,"Chic? Oh, don't you start using that filthy little word. ""Chic""?"
1142,1142,Whoever invented that ought to be spanked in public. I don't...
1143,1143,I don't even know what that word means.
1144,1144,"What is that word? Fucking ""chic""?"
1145,1145,"They should be hung, drawn and quartered! Fucking ""chic""!"
1146,1146,It shouldn't concern you.
1147,1147,It does concern me.
1148,1148,"It concerns me very much, Cyril, because it's hurt my feelings."
1149,1149,It's hurt my feelings.
1150,1150,"So, what's all this moaning about?"
1151,1151,I am not moaning.
1152,1152,I do not like to be turned away from.
1153,1153,Nobody does.
1154,1154,But I don't want to hear it because it hurts my ears.
1155,1155,"I've made a terrible mistake in my life, Cyril. I've made a..."
1156,1156,I've made a terrible mistake.
1157,1157,I need you to help me.
1158,1158,What do you want me to do?
1159,1159,I can't work.
1160,1160,"I can't concentrate, I have no confidence."
1161,1161,She does not fit in this house.
1162,1162,"We built this house, the two of us."
1163,1163,"Now, she's turning the whole bloody place upside down."
1164,1164,She's turning me inside out.
1165,1165,She's turning you and me against each other.
1166,1166,"Her arrival has cast a very long shadow, Cyril."
1167,1167,Mrs. Vaughan is satisfied with the dress.
1168,1168,No one gives a tinker's fucking curse about Mrs. Vaughan's satisfaction!
1169,1169,"Thank you, Alma."
1170,1170,Not at all.
1171,1171,What a model of politeness you two are.
1172,1172,There is an air of quiet death in this house and I do not like the way it smells.
1173,1173,Would you like a glass of wine?
1174,1174,"No, thank you."
1175,1175,Can I make you a martini?
1176,1176,"Nothing for me, thanks."
1177,1177,Water?
1178,1178,I want you flat on your back.
1179,1179,Helpless.
1180,1180,Tender.
1181,1181,Open.
1182,1182,With only me to help.
1183,1183,And then I want you strong again.
1184,1184,You're not going to die.
1185,1185,"You might wish you were going to die, but you're not going to."
1186,1186,You need to settle down a little.
1187,1187,"Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick."
1188,1188,"I think, perhaps, you should telephone that boy doctor of yours, just in case."
1189,1189,You don't trust me?
1190,1190,"No, I do trust you."
1191,1191,It's just...
1192,1192,If you wish.
1193,1193,But I will make you well again.
1194,1194,I will.
1195,1195,I love you.
1196,1196,"I love you, too."
1197,1197,"And I think, perhaps, you should leave the room."
1198,1198, Close the door behind you.
1199,1199, Yes.
1200,1200,I'll be right outside.
1201,1201,"If he didn't wake up from this, if he wasn't here tomorrow, no matter."
1202,1202,For I know he'd be waiting for me in the afterlife.
1203,1203,"Or some safe, celestial place in this life and the next and the next one after."
1204,1204,"And for whatever there is on the road that follows from here, it would only require my patience to get to him again."
1205,1205,"You see, to be in love with him makes life no great mystery."
1206,1206,"Say, ""Ah."" Ahh."
1207,1207,Very good.
1208,1208,You can put your robe back on.
1209,1209,Sometimes I jump ahead in our life together.
1210,1210,And I see a time near the end.
1211,1211,I can predict the future and everything has settled.
1212,1212,And all our lovers and children and friends come back and are welcome.
1213,1213,And we have large gatherings where everyone is laughing and playing games.
1214,1214,"I am older and I see things differently, and I finally understand you."
1215,1215,And I take care of your dresses.
1216,1216,Keeping them from dust and ghosts and time.
1217,1217,"Yes, but right now, we're here."
1218,1218,"Yes, of course we are."
1219,1219,And I'm getting hungry.
