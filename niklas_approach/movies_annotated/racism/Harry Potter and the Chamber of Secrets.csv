2,2,Now you've done it.
3,3,He's in there. Vernon?
4,4,"l'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go."
5,5,But she's bored.
6,6,lf l could only let her out for an hour or two.
7,7,"So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir."
8,8,But l haven't had any messages from any of my friends.
9,9,Not one...
10,10,...all summer.
11,11,Who would want to be friends with you?
12,12,l should think you'd be a little more grateful.
13,13,"We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table..."
14,14,...even let you have Dudley's second bedroom...
15,15,...purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
16,16,Not now. lt's for when the Masons arrive.
17,17,Which should be any minute.
18,18,"Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we?"
19,19,"Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?"
20,20,"ln the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home."
21,21,"Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?"

24,24,And you?
25,25,"l'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that l don't exist."
26,26,"Too right, you will."
27,27,"With any luck, this could be the day l make the biggest deal of my career..."
28,28,...and you will not mess it up.
29,29,"Harry Potter, such an honor it is."
30,30,Who are you?
31,31,"Dobby, sir. Dobby the houseelf."
32,32,Not to be rude or anything...
33,33,...but this isn't a great time for me to have a houseelf in my bedroom.
34,34,"Yes, sir. Dobby understands."
35,35,lt's just that Dobby has come to tell you....
36,36,"lt is difficult, sir."
37,37,Dobby wonders where to begin.
38,38,Why don't you sit down?
39,39,Sit down? Sit down?
40,40,"Dobby, l'm sorry. l didn't mean to offend you or anything."
41,41,Offend Dobby?
42,42,"Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir..."
43,43,"...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
44,44,You can't have met many decent wizards then.
45,45,"No, l haven't."
46,46,That was an awful thing to say.
47,47,Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
48,48,"Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush."
49,49,"Dobby, please, stop."
50,50,Don't mind that. lt's just the cat.
51,51,Bad Dobby.
52,52,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet."
53,53,Are you all right?
54,54,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir."
55,55,"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
56,56,Your family?
57,57,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir."
58,58,Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.
59,59,lf they ever knew Dobby was here....
60,60,But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.
61,61,Harry Potter must not go back...
62,62,...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
63,63,"There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
64,64,What terrible things?
65,65,Who's plotting them?
66,66,Can't say.
67,67,"Okay, l understand. You can't say."
68,68,"Don't make me talk. l Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down."
69,69,Bad Dobby.
70,70,So when they arrive at the ninth hole....
71,71,Give me the lamp.
72,72,"Dobby, stop!"
73,73,Let me go.
74,74,Get in there and keep quiet.
75,75,What the devil are you doing up here?
76,76,l was just You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.
77,77,Sorry.
78,78,"One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy."
79,79,And fix that door.
80,80,"Yes, sir."
81,81,See why l've got to go back?
82,82,l don't belong here.
83,83,"l belong in your world, at Hogwarts."
84,84,lt's the only place l've got friends.
85,85,Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?
86,86,"Well, l expect they've been...."
87,87,Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
88,88,Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby.
89,89,Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him...
90,90,"...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
91,91,Give me those. Now.
92,92,No!
93,93,"Dobby, get back here."
94,94,"Dobby, please, no."
95,95,Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.
96,96,l can't. Hogwarts is my home.
97,97,"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
98,98,"lt spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this building."
99,99,"One plumber said, ''Look at all that water.'' The second plumber said, ''Yes, and that's just the top of it.'' Mr. Mason."
100,100,Vernon tells me that you're a wonderful golfer.
101,101,l play occasionally.
102,102,Mrs. Mason.
103,103,Where do you get your beautiful suits?
104,104,All of my suits are tailormade.
105,105,Dudley.
106,106,Wasn't there something you wanted to say?
107,107,Pudding.
108,108,Pudding? What pudding?
109,109,l'm so sorry. lt's my nephew.
110,110,He's very disturbed.
111,111,Meeting strangers upsets him.
112,112,That's why l kept him upstairs.
113,113,"Well, we have ice cream."
114,114,You're never going back to that school.
115,115,You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
116,116,"Hiya, Harry."
117,117,Ron. Fred. George.
118,118,What are you all doing here?
119,119,"Rescuing you, of course."
120,120,"Now, come on, get your trunk."
121,121,You better stand back.
122,122,Let's go.
123,123,What was that?
124,124,What was it?
125,125,Potter!
126,126,"Dad, what's going on?"
127,127,Go. Go. Go.
128,128,"Dad, hurry up."
129,129,Come on.
130,130,"Come on, Harry, hurry up."
131,131,"Petunia, he's escaping!"
132,132,"l've got you, Harry."
133,133,Come here!
134,134,Let go of me!
135,135,"No, boy!"
136,136,You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere.
137,137,Get off!
138,138,Drive!
139,139,Right.
140,140,Right!
141,141,No! No! No! No!
142,142,Dad!
143,143,Damn.
144,144,"By the way, Harry, happy birthday."
145,145,Come on.
146,146,"Okay, come on."
147,147,"Okay, come on."
148,148,Think it'd be all right if we had some?
149,149,"Yeah, Mum will never know."
150,150,"lt's not much, but it's home."
151,151,l think it's brilliant.
152,152,Where have you been?
153,153,"Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear."
154,154,Beds empty. No note. Car gone.
155,155,You could have died.
156,156,You could have been seen.
157,157,"Of course, l don't blame you, Harry, dear."
158,158,"They were starving him, Mum."
159,159,There were bars on his window.
160,160,"Well, you best hope l don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley."
161,161,"Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast."
162,162,"Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in."
163,163,That's it. There we go.
164,164,"Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
165,165,"Yes, dear, it was on the cat."
166,166,Hello.
167,167,What did l do?
168,168,"Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really."
169,169,"Morning, Weasleys."
170,170,"Morning, Dad."
171,171,What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
172,172,Raids?
173,173,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office."
174,174,"Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
175,175,"Well, now."
176,176,And who are you?
177,177,"Sorry, sir. l'm Harry, sir."
178,178,Harry Potter.
179,179,Good Lord. Are you really?
180,180,"Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
181,181,This morning.
182,182,Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
183,183,Did you really? How did it go?
184,184,"l mean That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you."
185,185,"Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles."
186,186,"Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
187,187,"Well, that'll be Errol with the post."
188,188,"Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?"
189,189,Errol.
190,190,He's always doing that.
191,191,"Look, it's our Hogwarts letters."
192,192,They've sent us Harry's as well.
193,193,Dumbledore must know you're here.
194,194,"Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
195,195,No.
196,196,This lot won't come cheap.
197,197,The spell books alone are very expensive.
198,198,We'll manage.
199,199,There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
200,200,Right.
201,201,"Here we are, Harry."
202,202,"You go first, dear."
203,203,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
204,204,Floo powder?
205,205,"You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes."
206,206,ln you go.
207,207,That's it.
208,208,Diagon Alley.
209,209,"You see? lt's quite easy, dear."
210,210,Don't be afraid. Come on.
211,211,Come on.
212,212,ln you go. That's it. Mind your head.
213,213,That's right.
214,214,"Now, take your Floo powder."
215,215,"That's it, very good."
216,216,"Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
217,217,Diagonally.
218,218,"What did he say, dear?"
219,219,Diagonally.
220,220,l thought he did.
221,221,"Don't touch anything, Draco."
222,222,"Yes, Father."
223,223,"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again."
224,224,And young Master Malfoy too. Delighted.
225,225,"l must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced l'm not buying today, Borgin. l'm selling."
226,226,Selling?
227,227,Draco.
228,228,"You're aware, no doubt, that the Ministry of Magic..."
229,229,...is conducting more raids on private houses.
230,230,There's even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act.
231,231,"Pure wizard blood is counting for less everywhere, l'm afraid."
232,232,Not with me.
233,233,"Anyway, l brought a few items from home that might prove..."
234,234,...embarrassing were the Ministry to call.
235,235,Poisons and the like.
236,236,Look at this.
237,237,That particular item is not for sale.
238,238,l understand. lt has unique qualities.
239,239,One wouldn't want to see it falling into the wrong hands.
240,240,You can keep the box.
241,241,What did l say?
242,242,Touch nothing.
243,243,Exactly.
244,244,"Sorry, Father."
245,245,Come on. We're going.
246,246,"lt's a pleasure to do business with you, Mr. Malfoy."
247,247,Always a pleasure.
248,248,Looking for something?
249,249,"No, l...."
250,250,l'm just in the wrong place.
251,251,Sorry.
252,252,Thank you.
253,253,"Not lost, are you, my dear?"
254,254,"l'm fine, thank you. l was just going...."
255,255,Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.
256,256,No. Please Harry?
257,257,Hagrid!
258,258,What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
259,259,"You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place."
260,260,Don't want no one to see you there.
261,261,People will think you're up to no good.
262,262,"l was lost, l Hang on. What were you doing down there then?"
263,263,Me? l was.... l was looking for FleshEating Slug Repellent.
264,264,They're ruining all the school cabbages.
265,265,Harry. Hagrid.
266,266,"Hello, Hermione."
267,267,lt's so good to see you.
268,268,lt's great to see you too.
269,269,What did you do to your glasses?
270,270,Oculus Reparo.
271,271,l definitely need to remember that one.
272,272,"You'll be all right now then, Harry?"
273,273,Right. l'll leave you to it.
274,274,"Okay, bye."
275,275,Thank you. Bye.
276,276,"Come on, everyone's been so worried."
277,277,Harry.
278,278,Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
279,279,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
280,280,Here he is.
281,281,Mum fancies him.
282,282,"Make way there, please."
283,283,"Let me by, madam. Thank you."
284,284,"Excuse me, little girl."
285,285,This is for the Daily Prophet.
286,286,lt can't be. Harry Potter?
287,287,Harry Potter!
288,288,"Excuse me, madam."
289,289,"Nice big smile, Harry."
290,290,"Together, you and l rate the front page."
291,291,"Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is."
292,292,When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning...
293,293,"...to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me..."
294,294,"...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating..."
295,295,...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list...
296,296,"...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving..."
297,297,...with my entire collected works...
298,298,...free of charge.
299,299,"Now, ladies?"
300,300,"Harry, now you give me those, and l'll get them signed."
301,301,All of you wait outside.
302,302,That's it.
303,303,"l'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?"
304,304,Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
305,305,Leave him alone.
306,306,"Look, Potter."
307,307,You've got yourself a girlfriend.
308,308,"Now, now, Draco, play nicely."
309,309,Mr. Potter.
310,310,Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
311,311,Forgive me.
312,312,Your scar is legend.
313,313,"As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
314,314,Voldemort killed my parents.
315,315,He was nothing more than a murderer.
316,316,You must be very brave to mention his name.
317,317,Or very foolish.
318,318,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
319,319,And you must be Miss Granger.
320,320,"Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents."
321,321,"Muggles, aren't they?"
322,322,Let me see.
323,323,"Red hair, vacant expressions..."
324,324,"...tatty, secondhand book."
325,325,You must be the Weasleys.
326,326,lt's mad in here.
327,327,Let's go outside.
328,328,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
329,329,Lucius.
330,330,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?"
331,331,l do hope they're paying you overtime...
332,332,"...but judging by the state of this, l'd say not."
333,333,What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard...
334,334,...if they don't even pay you well for it?
335,335,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
336,336,Clearly.
337,337,Associating with Muggles.
338,338,And l thought your family could sink no lower.
339,339,l'll see you at work.
340,340,See you at school.
341,341,1 0:58. Come on.
342,342,The train will be leaving any moment.
343,343,"Fred, George, Percy, you first."
344,344,Okay.
345,345,"After you, dear."
346,346,"Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry."
347,347,Let's go.
348,348,What do you two think you're doing?
349,349,Sorry.
350,350,Lost control of the trolley.
351,351,Why can't we get through?
352,352,l don't know.
353,353,The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.
354,354,The train leaves at exactly 1 1 :00.
355,355,We've missed it.
356,356,"Harry, if we can't get through..."
357,357,...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
358,358,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
359,359,The car.
360,360,There we go.
361,361,"Now, all we need to do is find the Hogwarts Express."
362,362,"Ron, are you sure you know how to fly this?"
363,363,No problem.
364,364,Look out!
365,365,"Ron, l should tell you..."
366,366,...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
367,367,Right.
368,368,Okay.
369,369,"Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster must be faulty."
370,370,"Come on, then. Let's go lower."
371,371,We need to find the train.
372,372,Okay.
373,373,All we need to do is catch up with the train.
374,374,We can't be far behind.
375,375,Do you hear that?
376,376,We must be getting close.
377,377,Hold on.
378,378,Harry!
379,379,Hold on!
380,380,Take my hand!
381,381,Hold on!
382,382,l'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
383,383,l think we found the train.
384,384,Yeah.
385,385,Welcome home.
386,386,Up! Up!
387,387,lt's not working!
388,388,"Up! Ron, mind that tree!"
389,389,Stop! Stop! Stop!
390,390,My wand. Look at my wand.
391,391,Be thankful it's not your neck.
392,392,What's happening?
393,393,l don't know.
394,394,"Come on, go! Fast!"
395,395,"Scabbers, you're okay."
396,396,The car!
397,397,Dad's gonna kill me.
398,398,"See you, Hedwig."
399,399,So a houseelf shows up in my bedroom...
400,400,...we can't get through the barrier to platform 9 3/4...
401,401,...we almost get killed by a tree....
402,402,Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
403,403,"Well, take a good look, lads."
404,404,This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
405,405,"Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
406,406,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
407,407,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
408,408,You have risked the exposure of our world.
409,409,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow...
410,410,...that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
411,411,"Honestly, Professor Snape, l think it did more damage to us."
412,412,Silence.
413,413,"l assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me..."
414,414,...the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
415,415,As it is They are not.
416,416,Professor Dumbledore.
417,417,Professor McGonagall.
418,418,Headmaster...
419,419,...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
420,420,"As such l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus..."
421,421,...having written quite a few of them myself.
422,422,"However, as head of Gryffindor house..."
423,423,...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
424,424,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
425,425,"What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
426,426,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
427,427,"Not today, Mr. Weasley..."
428,428,...but l must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
429,429,"l will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
430,430,"Mr. Filch, you dropped this."
431,431,"Good morning, everyone."
432,432,"Good morning, Professor Sprout."
433,433,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone."
434,434,Today we're going to repot Mandrakes.
435,435,Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root?
436,436,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
437,437,"Mandrake, or Mandragora..."
438,438,...is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.
439,439,lt's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
440,440,Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
441,441,As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings...
442,442,...their cries won't kill you yet.
443,443,"But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why l have given you earmuffs..."
444,444,...for auditory protection.
445,445,"So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly."
446,446,"Flaps tight down, and watch me closely."
447,447,You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
448,448,You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
449,449,Got it? And...
450,450,...now you dunk it down into the other pot...
451,451,...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
452,452,Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
453,453,"No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
454,454,"Yes, well, just leave him there."
455,455,"Right, on we go."
456,456,Plenty of pots to go around.
457,457,Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
458,458,There's Nearly Headless Nick.
459,459,"Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater."
460,460,"Hello, Sir Nicholas."
461,461,Say it. l'm doomed.
462,462,You're doomed.
463,463,"Hi, Harry."
464,464,l'm Colin Creevey. l'm in Gryffindor too.
465,465,"Hi, Colin, nice to meet you."
466,466,"Say, do you think your friend here..."
467,467,...could take a photo of me and you standing together?
468,468,"You know, to prove l've met you."
469,469,lt's for my dad.
470,470,"He's a milkman, you know. A Muggle, like all our family's been until me."
471,471,No one knew all the stuff l could do was magic till we got our Hogwarts letter.
472,472,Everyone just thought l was mental.
473,473,lmagine that.
474,474,"Ron, is that your owl?"
475,475,Bloody bird's a menace.
476,476,"Oh, no."
477,477,"Look, everyone."
478,478,Weasley's got himself a Howler.
479,479,"Go on, Ron. l ignored one from my gran once. lt was horrible."
480,480,Ronald Weasley!
481,481,How dare you steal that car!
482,482,l am absolutely disgusted!
483,483,Your father's now facing an inquiry at work...
484,484,...and it's entirely your fault!
485,485,lf you put another toe out of line...
486,486,...we'll bring you straight home!
487,487,"And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor."
488,488,Your father and l are so proud.
489,489,Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
490,490,Me.
491,491,Gilderoy Lockhart...
492,492,"...Order of Merlin, Third Class..."
493,493,...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League...
494,494,...and five times winner...
495,495,...of Witch Weekly's MostCharmingSmile Award.
496,496,But l don't talk about that.
497,497,l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him.
498,498,l see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done.
499,499,"Now, l thought we'd start today with a little quiz."
500,500,Nothing to worry about.
501,501,Just to check how well you've read them.
502,502,Thank you.
503,503,How much you've taken in.
504,504,Look at these questions.
505,505,They're all about him.
506,506,''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'' ''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'' You have 30 minutes. Start...
507,507,...now.
508,508,Hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac.
509,509,But Miss Hermione Granger knew...
510,510,...that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil...
511,511,...and market my own range of haircare potions. Good girl.
512,512,"Now, be warned."
513,513,lt is my job to arm you...
514,514,...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
515,515,You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
516,516,Know only that no harm can befall you whilst l am here.
517,517,l must ask you not to scream.
518,518,lt might provoke them.
519,519,Cornish pixies?
520,520,Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
521,521,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan..."
522,522,...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.
523,523,Let's see what you make of them.
524,524,"Come on now, round them up."
525,525,They're only pixies.
526,526,You just stay there!
527,527,"Please, get me down!"
528,528,Get off me!
529,529,Stop. Hold still!
530,530,Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
531,531,l'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
532,532,What do we do now?
533,533,lmmobulus!
534,534,Why is it always me?
535,535,l spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.
536,536,"We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer."
537,537,What? l don't believe it.
538,538,"Where you think you're going, Flint?"
539,539,Quidditch practice.
540,540,l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
541,541,"Easy, Wood. l've got a note."
542,542,l smell trouble.
543,543,"''l, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team..."
544,544,"...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.'' You've got a new Seeker. Who?"
545,545,Malfoy?
546,546,That's right.
547,547,And that's not all that's new this year.
548,548,Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
549,549,How did you get those?
550,550,A gift from Draco's father.
551,551,"You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
552,552,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
553,553,They got in on pure talent.
554,554,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood."
555,555,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy."
556,556,Eat slugs!
557,557,"You okay, Ron?"
558,558,Say something.
559,559,"Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
560,560,"No, Colin, get out of the way."
561,561,Let's take him to Hagrid's.
562,562,He'll know what to do.
563,563,This calls for a specialist's equipment.
564,564,"Nothing to do but wait till it stops, l'm afraid."
565,565,Okay.
566,566,Better out than in.
567,567,"Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?"
568,568,Malfoy. He called Hermione....
569,569,"Well, l don't know exactly what it means."
570,570,He called me a Mudblood.
571,571,He did not.
572,572,What's a Mudblood?
573,573,lt means ''dirty blood.'' Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who's Muggleborn.
574,574,Someone with nonmagic parents.
575,575,Someone like me.
576,576,lt's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
577,577,"See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family..."
578,578,...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pureblood.
579,579,That's horrible.
580,580,lt's disgusting.
581,581,And it's codswallop to boot.
582,582,Dirty blood.
583,583,"Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not halfblood or less."
584,584,"More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do."
585,585,Come here.
586,586,"Don't you think on it, Hermione."
587,587,Don't you think on it for one minute.
588,588,"Harry, Harry, Harry."
589,589,Can you possibly imagine...
590,590,...a better way to serve detention...
591,591,...than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
592,592,Not really.
593,593,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry."
594,594,Celebrity is as celebrity does.
595,595,Remember that.
596,596,Come.
597,597,Come...
598,598,...to me.
599,599,What?
600,600,Sorry?
601,601,That voice.
602,602,Voice?
603,603,Didn't you hear it?
604,604,"What are you talking about, Harry?"
605,605,l think you're getting a bit drowsy.
606,606,"And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours."
607,607,Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.
608,608,Spooky.
609,609,Blood.
610,610,l smell blood.
611,611,Let me rip you.
612,612,Let me kill you.
613,613,Kill!
614,614,Kill!
615,615,Kill!
616,616,Harry!
617,617,Did you hear it?
618,618,Hear what?
619,619,That voice.
620,620,Voice? What voice?
621,621,l heard it first in Lockhart's office.
622,622,And then again just lt's time.
623,623,lt's moving.
624,624,l think it's going to kill.
625,625,Kill?
626,626,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
627,627,Strange.
628,628,l've never seen spiders act like that.
629,629,l don't like spiders.
630,630,What's that?
631,631,"''The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.'' lt's written in blood."
632,632,"Oh, no."
633,633,lt's Filch's cat.
634,634,lt's Mrs. Norris.
635,635,"''Enemies of the Heir, beware.'' You'll be next, Mudbloods."
636,636,What's going on here?
637,637,"Go on. Make way, make way."
638,638,Potter?
639,639,What are you...?
640,640,Mrs. Norris?
641,641,You've murdered my cat.
642,642,No. No.
643,643,l'll kill you.
644,644,l'll kill you!
645,645,Argus!
646,646,"Argus, l...."
647,647,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
648,648,Everyone except...
649,649,...you three.
650,650,"Ravenclaws, follow me."
651,651,"She's not dead, Argus."
652,652,She has been Petrified.
653,653,Thought so.
654,654,So unlucky l wasn't there.
655,655,l know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
656,656,"But how she has been Petrified, l cannot say."
657,657,Ask him.
658,658,lt's him that's done it.
659,659,You saw what he wrote on the wall.
660,660,"lt's not true, sir. l swear."
661,661,l never touched Mrs. Norris.
662,662,Rubbish.
663,663,"lf l might, headmaster?"
664,664,Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
665,665,However...
666,666,...the circumstances are suspicious.
667,667,"l, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
668,668,"l'm afraid that's my doing, Severus."
669,669,"You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
670,670,"That's why Ron and l went looking for him, professor."
671,671,We'd just found him when he said....
672,672,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
673,673,When l said l wasn't hungry.
674,674,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
675,675,"lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus."
676,676,My cat has been Petrified.
677,677,l want to see some punishment!
678,678,"We will be able to cure her, Argus."
679,679,"As l understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake."
680,680,"When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris."
681,681,And in the meantime...
682,682,...l strongly recommend caution...
683,683,...to all.
684,684,"lt's a bit strange, isn't it?"
685,685,Strange?
686,686,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear..."
687,687,...and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. lt's just strange.
688,688,Do you think l should have told them?
689,689,"Dumbledore and the others, l mean?"
690,690,Are you mad?
691,691,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
692,692,"She's right, you know."
693,693,"Could l have your attention, please?"
694,694,"Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals..."
695,695,...into water goblets.
696,696,Like so.
697,697,"One, two, three."
698,698,Vera Verto.
699,699,Now it's your turn.
700,700,Who would like to go first?
701,701,Mr. Weasley.
702,702,"''One, two, three. Vera Verto.'' Vera Verto!"
703,703,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley."
704,704,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
705,705,Professor...
706,706,...l was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
707,707,Very well.
708,708,"You all know, of course..."
709,709,...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago...
710,710,"...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff..."
711,711,...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.
712,712,"Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously."
713,713,One did not.
714,714,Three guesses who.
715,715,Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective...
716,716,...about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
717,717,He believed magical learning should be kept within allmagic families.
718,718,"ln other words, purebloods."
719,719,"Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school."
720,720,"Now, according to legend..."
721,721,...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle...
722,722,...known as the Chamber of Secrets.
723,723,"Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it..."
724,724,...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.
725,725,The Heir alone...
726,726,...would be able to open the Chamber...
727,727,"...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing..."
728,728,...purge the school of all those who...
729,729,"...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
730,730,Muggleborns.
731,731,"Naturally, the school has been searched many times."
732,732,No such chamber has been found.
733,733,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
734,734,The Chamber is said to be home to something...
735,735,...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
736,736,lt is said to be the home...
737,737,...of a monster.
738,738,Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
739,739,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
740,740,"lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, that means The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
741,741,Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggleborns are scum?
742,742,lf you're talking about Malfoy Of course. You heard him.
743,743,"''You'll be next, Mudbloods.'' l heard him."
744,744,"But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
745,745,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione."
746,746,"l mean, look at his family."
747,747,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
748,748,Crabbe and Goyle must know.
749,749,Maybe we could trick them into telling.
750,750,Even they aren't that thick.
751,751,But there might be another way.
752,752,"Mind you, it would be difficult."
753,753,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
754,754,...and it'll be dangerous.
755,755,Very dangerous.
756,756,Here it is.
757,757,The Polyjuice Potion.
758,758,"''Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker..."
759,759,"...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'' You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
760,760,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
761,761,Exactly.
762,762,But it's tricky. l've never seen a more complicated potion.
763,763,How long will it take to make?
764,764,A month.
765,765,A month?
766,766,"But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin..."
767,767,...he could attack half the Muggleborns in the school by then.
768,768,l know.
769,769,But it's the only plan we've got.
770,770,Another goal for Slytherin!
771,771,They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
772,772,Yeah!
773,773,Yeah!
774,774,"All right there, Scarhead?"
775,775,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
776,776,"Wood, look out!"
777,777,Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
778,778,"That's been tampered with, that has."
779,779,l'll stop it.
780,780,"No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry."
781,781,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
782,782,"You'll never catch me, Potter."
783,783,Let's go.
784,784,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
785,785,Gryffindor wins!
786,786,Finite lncantatem!
787,787,Thank you.
788,788,Are you okay?
789,789,No. l think my arm is broken.
790,790,"Not to worry, Harry. l will fix that arm of yours straightaway."
791,791,Not you.
792,792,Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
793,793,This won't hurt a bit.
794,794,Brackium Emendo!
795,795,"Yes, well, that can sometimes happen..."
796,796,...but the point is...
797,797,"...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken."
798,798,Broken? There's no bones left.
799,799,"Much more flexible, though."
800,800,"Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss."
801,801,You can go. Out of my way.
802,802,Should have been brought straight to me.
803,803,"l can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back...."
804,804,"You will be able to, won't you?"
805,805,"l'll be able to, certainly."
806,806,But it'll be painful.
807,807,"You're in for a rough night, Potter."
808,808,Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
809,809,What do you expect?
810,810,Pumpkin juice?
811,811,Kill.
812,812,Kill.
813,813,Time to kill.
814,814,Hello.
815,815,Dobby?
816,816,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.
817,817,Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
818,818,lt was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
819,819,"lndeed. Yes, sir."
820,820,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
821,821,At least you would be away from here.
822,822,Harry Potter must go home.
823,823,Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
824,824,"Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir."
825,825,Dobby had to iron his hands.
826,826,"You better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you."
827,827,"Dobby is used to death threats, sir."
828,828,Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
829,829,l don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
830,830,"Not kill you, sir."
831,831,Never kill you.
832,832,Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed...
833,833,...over HeWhoMustNotBeNamed.
834,834,"We houseelves were treated like vermin, sir."
835,835,"Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin."
836,836,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
837,837,"This, sir? lt is a mark of the houseelf's enslavement."
838,838,Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
839,839,Listen.
840,840,Listen!
841,841,Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.
842,842,Harry Potter must not stay here...
843,843,...now that history is to repeat itself.
844,844,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
845,845,l shouldn't have said that.
846,846,Bad Dobby! Bad!
847,847,Stop it!
848,848,"Stop it, Dobby!"
849,849,Tell me. When did this happen before?
850,850,Who's doing it now?
851,851,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
852,852,"No, Dobby. Tell me."
853,853,Who is it?
854,854,Put him here.
855,855,What happened?
856,856,There's been another attack.
857,857,"l think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey."
858,858,Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.
859,859,"What can this mean, Albus?"
860,860,lt means...
861,861,...that our students are in great danger.
862,862,What should l tell the staff?
863,863,The truth.
864,864,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
865,865,"lt is as we feared, Minerva."
866,866,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
867,867,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
868,868,Of course.
869,869,Don't you see?
870,870,Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
871,871,Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
872,872,Maybe.
873,873,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
874,874,Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight...
875,875,...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
876,876,Don't you think we'll get caught?
877,877,No. No one ever comes in here.
878,878,Why?
879,879,Moaning Myrtle.
880,880,Who?
881,881,Moaning Myrtle.
882,882,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
883,883,l'm Moaning Myrtle.
884,884,l wouldn't expect you to know me.
885,885,"Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable..."
886,886,...moping Moaning Myrtle?
887,887,She's a little sensitive.
888,888,Gather round!
889,889,Gather round.
890,890,Can everybody see me?
891,891,Can you all hear me?
892,892,Excellent.
893,893,ln light of the dark events of recent weeks...
894,894,...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club...
895,895,...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves...
896,896,...as l myself have done on countless occasions.
897,897,"For full details, see my published works."
898,898,"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?"
899,899,Awfully brave chap.
900,900,Justin FinchFletchley. Hufflepuff.
901,901,Nice to meet you. l'm l know who you are. We all do.
902,902,Even us Muggleborns.
903,903,Let me introduce my assistant...
904,904,...Professor Snape.
905,905,He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.
906,906,l don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
907,907,You'll still have your Potions master when l'm through with him. Never fear.
908,908,One.
909,909,Two.
910,910,Three!
911,911,Expelliarmus!
912,912,Do you think he's all right?
913,913,Who cares?
914,914,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape..."
915,915,"...but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious what you were about to do."
916,916,"lf l had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
917,917,Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students...
918,918,"...to block unfriendly spells, professor."
919,919,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape."
920,920,Let's have a volunteer pair.
921,921,"Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
922,922,Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
923,923,We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
924,924,Might l suggest someone from my own house?
925,925,"Malfoy, perhaps?"
926,926,"Good luck, Potter."
927,927,"Thank you, sir."
928,928,Wands at the ready.
929,929,"Scared, Potter?"
930,930,You wish.
931,931,On the count of three...
932,932,...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.
933,933,We don't want any accidents here.
934,934,One.
935,935,Two.
936,936,Everte Statum!
937,937,Rictusempra!
938,938,l said disarm only.
939,939,Serpensortia!
940,940,"Don't move, Potter."
941,941,l'll get rid of it for you.
942,942,"Allow me, Professor Snape."
943,943,Alarte Ascendare!
944,944,Vipera Evanesca.
945,945,What are you playing at?
946,946,You're a Parselmouth?
947,947,Why didn't you tell us?
948,948,l'm a what?
949,949,You can talk to snakes.
950,950,l know. l accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
951,951,Once. But so what?
952,952,l bet loads of people here can do it.
953,953,"No, they can't."
954,954,"lt's not a very common gift, Harry."
955,955,This is bad.
956,956,What's bad? lf l hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin That's what you said to it.
957,957,You were there. You heard me.
958,958,l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
959,959,Snake language.
960,960,l spoke a different language?
961,961,But l didn't realize How can l speak a language without knowing l can?
962,962,"l don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something."
963,963,"Harry, listen to me."
964,964,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
965,965,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
966,966,He could talk to snakes too.
967,967,Exactly.
968,968,Now the whole school's gonna think you're his greatgreatgreat grandson.
969,969,But l'm not.
970,970,l can't be.
971,971,He lived a thousand years ago.
972,972,"For all we know, you could be."
973,973,"Who am l, Hedwig?"
974,974,What am l?
975,975,l'll see you back in the common room.
976,976,"So anyway, l told Justin to hide up in our dormitory."
977,977,"l mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim..."
978,978,...it's best he keeps a low profile for a while.
979,979,But why would he want to attack Justin?
980,980,"Well, Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggleborn."
981,981,And you definitely think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin?
982,982,"Hannah, he's a Parselmouth."
983,983,Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard.
984,984,Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes?
985,985,They called Slytherin himself Serpenttongue.
986,986,"Harry always seems so nice, though."
987,987,"And, after all, he is the one who made YouKnowWho disappear."
988,988,That's probably why YouKnowWho wanted to kill him in the first place.
989,989,Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him.
990,990,l want blood.
991,991,They all must die.
992,992,Kill.
993,993,Kill.
994,994,Kill.
995,995,Time to kill.
996,996,Caught in the act.
997,997,"l'll have you out this time, Potter."
998,998,Mark my words.
999,999,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand Professor...
1000,1000,...l swear l didn't.
1001,1001,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
1002,1002,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
1003,1003,Sherbet Lemon.
1004,1004,Professor Dumbledore?
1005,1005,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
1006,1006,l was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
1007,1007,Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.
1008,1008,But l stand by what l said last year.
1009,1009,You would have done well in Slytherin.
1010,1010,You're wrong.
1011,1011,Harry?
1012,1012,Professor.
1013,1013,Your bird....
1014,1014,There was nothing l could do.
1015,1015,He just caught fire.
1016,1016,And about time too.
1017,1017,He's been looking dreadful for days.
1018,1018,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
1019,1019,"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry."
1020,1020,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
1021,1021,...and then they are...
1022,1022,...reborn from the ashes.
1023,1023,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
1024,1024,They can carry immensely heavy loads.
1025,1025,Their tears have healing powers.
1026,1026,"Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
1027,1027,Wait! Listen!
1028,1028,"Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry."
1029,1029,l'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.
1030,1030,Relax.
1031,1031,l do not believe...
1032,1032,...that Harry attacked anyone.
1033,1033,Of course you don't.
1034,1034,"Right. Well, l'll...."
1035,1035,"l'll just wait outside, then."
1036,1036,Yes.
1037,1037,"You don't think it was me, professor?"
1038,1038,"No, Harry."
1039,1039,l do not think it was you.
1040,1040,But l must ask you...
1041,1041,...is there something you wish to tell me?
1042,1042,"No, sir."
1043,1043,Nothing.
1044,1044,"Very well, then."
1045,1045,Off you go.
1046,1046,"Hey, look, everyone."
1047,1047,lt's the Heir of Slytherin.
1048,1048,Be careful. He's a seriously evil wizard.
1049,1049,"Come on, Harry. Fred and George were just having a laugh."
1050,1050,They're the only ones.
1051,1051,So half the school thinks you nip off to the Chamber of Secrets every night.
1052,1052,Who cares?
1053,1053,Maybe they're right.
1054,1054,Harry. Harry.
1055,1055,Come on.
1056,1056,l didn't know l can speak Parseltongue.
1057,1057,What else don't l know about myself?
1058,1058,Look...
1059,1059,...maybe you can do something...
1060,1060,"...even something horrible, and not know you did it."
1061,1061,"You don't believe that, Harry."
1062,1062,l know you don't.
1063,1063,"And if it makes you feel any better, Malfoy's staying for the holidays too."
1064,1064,Why would that make anyone feel any better?
1065,1065,Because in a few days the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.
1066,1066,"ln a few days, we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin."
1067,1067,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
1068,1068,Crabbe and Goyle.
1069,1069,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle...
1070,1070,...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
1071,1071,How?
1072,1072,l've got it all worked out.
1073,1073,l filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
1074,1074,"Simple, but powerful."
1075,1075,"Now, once they're asleep..."
1076,1076,...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs...
1077,1077,...and put on their uniforms.
1078,1078,"Whose hair are you ripping out, then?"
1079,1079,l've already got mine.
1080,1080,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
1081,1081,l got this off her robes.
1082,1082,l'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
1083,1083,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
1084,1084,"Ron, maybe l should do it."
1085,1085,Yeah. Right.
1086,1086,Wingardium Leviosa.
1087,1087,Cool.
1088,1088,How thick could you get?
1089,1089,"Come on, let's get them."
1090,1090,"Well, did you get the hairs?"
1091,1091,What are those?
1092,1092,Slytherin robes.
1093,1093,l had to sneak them from the laundry.
1094,1094,Are we going to drink that?
1095,1095,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
1096,1096,Add the hairs.
1097,1097,Essence of Crabbe.
1098,1098,Cheers.
1099,1099,l think l'm gonna be sick.
1100,1100,Me too.
1101,1101,Harry?
1102,1102,Ron.
1103,1103,Bloody hell!
1104,1104,We still sound like ourselves.
1105,1105,You need to sound more like Crabbe.
1106,1106,Bloody hell.
1107,1107,Excellent.
1108,1108,But where's Hermione?
1109,1109,l....
1110,1110,l don't think l'm going.
1111,1111,You go on without me.
1112,1112,"Hermione, are you okay?"
1113,1113,Just go. You're wasting time.
1114,1114,Come on.
1115,1115,l think the Slytherin common room's this way.
1116,1116,Excuse me.
1117,1117,What are you doing d?
1118,1118,"l mean, what are you doing down here?"
1119,1119,l happen to be a school prefect.
1120,1120,"You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night."
1121,1121,What are your names again?
1122,1122,l'm....
1123,1123,"Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?"
1124,1124,Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
1125,1125,Why are you wearing glasses?
1126,1126,Reading.
1127,1127,Reading?
1128,1128,l didn't know you could read.
1129,1129,"And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
1130,1130,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
1131,1131,"Well, sit down."
1132,1132,"You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave."
1133,1133,They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.
1134,1134,"What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
1135,1135,Stomachache.
1136,1136,"You know, l'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks."
1137,1137,l suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
1138,1138,Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing...
1139,1139,...that ever happened to this place.
1140,1140,You're wrong!
1141,1141,What?
1142,1142,You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
1143,1143,Well? Do you?
1144,1144,Harry Potter?
1145,1145,"Good one, Goyle."
1146,1146,You're absolutely right.
1147,1147,Saint Potter.
1148,1148,And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
1149,1149,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
1150,1150,"You know l don't, Goyle."
1151,1151,l told you yesterday.
1152,1152,How many times do l have to tell you?
1153,1153,ls this yours?
1154,1154,But my father did say this: lt's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.
1155,1155,He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
1156,1156,Only that they were expelled.
1157,1157,"The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died."
1158,1158,So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
1159,1159,As for me...
1160,1160,...l hope it's Granger.
1161,1161,What's the matter with you two?
1162,1162,You're acting very odd.
1163,1163,lt's his stomachache.
1164,1164,Calm down.
1165,1165,Scar.
1166,1166,Hair.
1167,1167,Hey! Where are you going?
1168,1168,That was close.
1169,1169,"Hermione, come out."
1170,1170,We've got loads to tell you.
1171,1171,Go away.
1172,1172,Wait till you see. lt's awful.
1173,1173,Hermione?
1174,1174,Are you okay?
1175,1175,Do you remember me telling you...
1176,1176,...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
1177,1177,lt was cat hair l plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
1178,1178,Look at my face.
1179,1179,Look at your tail.
1180,1180,Have you spoken to Hermione?
1181,1181,She should be out of hospital in a few days...
1182,1182,...when she stops coughing up fur balls.
1183,1183,What's this?
1184,1184,Yuck!
1185,1185,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
1186,1186,Come to throw something else at me?
1187,1187,Why would l throw something at you?
1188,1188,"Don't ask me. Here l am, minding my own business..."
1189,1189,...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
1190,1190,But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
1191,1191,"l mean, it'll just go right through you."
1192,1192,Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.
1193,1193,Ten points if you get it through her stomach!
1194,1194,Fifty points if it goes through her head!
1195,1195,"But who threw it at you, anyway?"
1196,1196,l don't know. l didn't see them.
1197,1197,"l was just sitting in the Ubend, thinking about death..."
1198,1198,...and it fell through the top of my head.
1199,1199,There's a name in this diary.
1200,1200,Tom Marvolo Riddle.
1201,1201,Tom Marvolo Riddle?
1202,1202,Hang on. l know that name.
1203,1203,Why do l know that name?
1204,1204,Of course. That night l had detention.
1205,1205,My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room.
1206,1206,l remember because l kept burping up slugs over Tom Riddle's trophy.
1207,1207,What was the trophy for?
1208,1208,He won an award. 50 years ago.
1209,1209,Special services to the school or something.
1210,1210,50 years ago. Are you sure?
1211,1211,Yeah. Why?
1212,1212,Don't you remember what Malfoy told you?
1213,1213,The last time the Chamber was opened was Fifty years ago.
1214,1214,But that means Tom Riddle was here at Hogwarts when it happened.
1215,1215,What if he wrote about what he saw?
1216,1216,lt's possible he knew where the Chamber was...
1217,1217,"...how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it."
1218,1218,"lf so, whoever's behind these attacks wouldn't want this diary lying around..."
1219,1219,...would they?
1220,1220,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione, but there's just one flaw."
1221,1221,There's nothing written in this diary.
1222,1222,Do you mind?
1223,1223,''Tom Marvolo Riddle.'' My name...
1224,1224,...is Harry...
1225,1225,...Potter.
1226,1226,Do you know anything...
1227,1227,...about the Chamber of Secrets?
1228,1228,Can you...
1229,1229,...tell me?
1230,1230,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here?
1231,1231,Are you Tom Riddle?
1232,1232,"Hello, can you hear me?"
1233,1233,Riddle!
1234,1234,Come.
1235,1235,Professor Dumbledore.
1236,1236,Dumbledore?
1237,1237,"lt is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
1238,1238,"Yes, professor. l suppose l...."
1239,1239,l had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
1240,1240,"l'm afraid they are, Tom."
1241,1241,They are true.
1242,1242,About the school as well?
1243,1243,l don't have a home to go to.
1244,1244,"They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?"
1245,1245,"l understand, Tom, but l'm afraid..."
1246,1246,...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
1247,1247,"Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught...."
1248,1248,ls there something...
1249,1249,...you wish to tell me?
1250,1250,"No, sir. Nothing."
1251,1251,"Very well, then. Off you go."
1252,1252,"Good night, sir."
1253,1253,Let's get you out of there.
1254,1254,"Evening, Hagrid."
1255,1255,"l'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid."
1256,1256,l don't think you meant it to kill anyone....
1257,1257,You can't. You don't understand.
1258,1258,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...
1259,1259,...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
1260,1260,lt wasn't him.
1261,1261,Aragog never killed no one. Never.
1262,1262,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid."
1263,1263,"Now, stand aside."
1264,1264,No!
1265,1265,"Stand aside, Hagrid."
1266,1266,No!
1267,1267,Cistem Aperio!
1268,1268,Arania Exumai!
1269,1269,Aragog!
1270,1270,Aragog!
1271,1271,l can't let you go.
1272,1272,"They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid."
1273,1273,You'll be expelled.
1274,1274,Hagrid!
1275,1275,"Ron. Ron, wake up."
1276,1276,What happened?
1277,1277,lt was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
1278,1278,lt can't be Hagrid.
1279,1279,lt just can't be.
1280,1280,We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
1281,1281,"He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
1282,1282,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron."
1283,1283,What would any of us have done?
1284,1284,"Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?"
1285,1285,That would be a cheerful visit.
1286,1286,"''Hello, Hagrid."
1287,1287,"Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?'' Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?"
1288,1288,No.
1289,1289,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
1290,1290,lt's FleshEating Slug Repellent.
1291,1291,"For the Mandrakes, you know."
1292,1292,"Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing up to do."
1293,1293,"But once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop them up and stew them..."
1294,1294,...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital unPetrified.
1295,1295,"ln the meantime, though, you three..."
1296,1296,...had best be looking after yourselves.
1297,1297,All right?
1298,1298,"Hello, Neville."
1299,1299,"Harry, l don't know who did it, but you'd better come."
1300,1300,Come on!
1301,1301,lt had to be a Gryffindor.
1302,1302,Nobody else knows our password.
1303,1303,Unless it wasn't a student.
1304,1304,"Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something."
1305,1305,And they found it.
1306,1306,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
1307,1307,"All right, listen up."
1308,1308,"We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance."
1309,1309,"We're stronger, quicker and smarter."
1310,1310,Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them...
1311,1311,...if they fly anywhere near him.
1312,1312,"Well, that too."
1313,1313,Professor McGonagall.
1314,1314,This match has been canceled.
1315,1315,We can't cancel Quidditch.
1316,1316,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now."
1317,1317,"Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley."
1318,1318,There's something the both of you have to see.
1319,1319,l warn you.
1320,1320,This could be a wee bit of a shock.
1321,1321,Hermione!
1322,1322,She was found near the library...
1323,1323,...along with this.
1324,1324,Does it mean anything to either of you?
1325,1325,No.
1326,1326,"Could l have your attention, please?"
1327,1327,"Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately: ''All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening."
1328,1328,All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
1329,1329,No exceptions.'' l should tell you this: Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught...
1330,1330,...it is likely the school will be closed.
1331,1331,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron."
1332,1332,l can't believe it's him...
1333,1333,...but if he did set the monster loose last time...
1334,1334,...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
1335,1335,But you heard McGonagall.
1336,1336,We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
1337,1337,l think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
1338,1338,Ready?
1339,1339,Who's there?
1340,1340,Hello?
1341,1341,Hello?
1342,1342,What's that for?
1343,1343,Nothing. l was expecting....
1344,1344,lt doesn't matter. Come on in.
1345,1345,l just made a pot of tea.
1346,1346,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
1347,1347,l'm fine. l'm all right.
1348,1348,Did you hear about Hermione?
1349,1349,"Yeah. l heard about that, all right."
1350,1350,"Look, we have to ask you something."
1351,1351,Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
1352,1352,"What you had to understand about that is Quick, under the cloak."
1353,1353,Don't say a word.
1354,1354,"Be quiet, both of you."
1355,1355,"Professor Dumbledore, sir."
1356,1356,"Good evening, Hagrid."
1357,1357,"l wonder, could we...?"
1358,1358,Of course. Come in. Come in.
1359,1359,That's Dad's boss.
1360,1360,"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic."
1361,1361,"Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business."
1362,1362,Had to come.
1363,1363,Three attacks on Muggleborns.
1364,1364,Things have gone far enough.
1365,1365,The Ministry's got to act.
1366,1366,"But l never You know l never, professor."
1367,1367,"l want it understood, Cornelius..."
1368,1368,...that Hagrid...
1369,1369,...has my full confidence.
1370,1370,"Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him."
1371,1371,l've got to take him.
1372,1372,Take me?
1373,1373,Take me where?
1374,1374,Not Azkaban prison.
1375,1375,"l'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
1376,1376,"Already here, Fudge?"
1377,1377,Good.
1378,1378,What are you doing here?
1379,1379,Get out of my house!
1380,1380,Believe me...
1381,1381,...l take absolutely no pleasure being inside your....
1382,1382,You call this a house?
1383,1383,No.
1384,1384,l simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
1385,1385,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
1386,1386,The other governors and l have decided it's time for you to step aside.
1387,1387,This is an order of suspension.
1388,1388,You'll find all 1 2 signatures on it.
1389,1389,l'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
1390,1390,"Well, what, with all these attacks..."
1391,1391,...there'll be no Muggleborns left at Hogwarts.
1392,1392,l can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
1393,1393,You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.
1394,1394,Take him away and the Muggleborns won't stand a chance.
1395,1395,"You mark my words, there'll be killings next!"
1396,1396,You think so?
1397,1397,"Calm yourself, Hagrid."
1398,1398,lf the governors desire my removal...
1399,1399,"...l will, of course, step aside."
1400,1400,However...
1401,1401,...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts...
1402,1402,...to those who...
1403,1403,...ask for it.
1404,1404,Admirable sentiments.
1405,1405,Shall we?
1406,1406,Fudge.
1407,1407,"Come, Hagrid."
1408,1408,Well?
1409,1409,lf....
1410,1410,lf anybody was looking for some stuff...
1411,1411,...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
1412,1412,Yep. That would lead them right.
1413,1413,That's all l have to say.
1414,1414,And someone will need to feed Fang while l'm away.
1415,1415,Good boy.
1416,1416,Hagrid's right.
1417,1417,"With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day."
1418,1418,Look.
1419,1419,Come on.
1420,1420,"Come on, Fang."
1421,1421,Come on.
1422,1422,What?
1423,1423,You heard what Hagrid said.
1424,1424,''Follow the spiders.'' They're heading to the Dark Forest.
1425,1425,Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ''follow the butterflies''?
1426,1426,"Harry, l don't like this."
1427,1427,"Harry, l don't like this at all."
1428,1428,Shush!
1429,1429,Can we go back now?
1430,1430,Come on.
1431,1431,Who is it?
1432,1432,Don't panic.
1433,1433,Hagrid?
1434,1434,ls that you?
1435,1435,We're friends of Hagrid's.
1436,1436,And you?
1437,1437,"You're Aragog, aren't you?"
1438,1438,Yes.
1439,1439,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
1440,1440,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks."
1441,1441,They think it's Hagrid.
1442,1442,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
1443,1443,That's a lie.
1444,1444,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
1445,1445,Then you're not the monster?
1446,1446,No.
1447,1447,The monster was born in the castle.
1448,1448,l came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.
1449,1449,Harry.
1450,1450,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
1451,1451,We do not speak of it.
1452,1452,lt is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
1453,1453,But have you seen it?
1454,1454,l never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
1455,1455,The girl was discovered in a bathroom.
1456,1456,"When l was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
1457,1457,Harry!
1458,1458,What?
1459,1459,"Well, thank you."
1460,1460,We'll just go.
1461,1461,Go?
1462,1462,l think not.
1463,1463,My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.
1464,1464,But l cannot deny them fresh meat...
1465,1465,...when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
1466,1466,"Goodbye, friend of Hagrid."
1467,1467,Can we panic now?
1468,1468,Know any spells?
1469,1469,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
1470,1470,Where's Hermione when you need her?
1471,1471,Let's go!
1472,1472,Arania Exumai!
1473,1473,Go!
1474,1474,Glad we're out of there.
1475,1475,Arania Exumai!
1476,1476,Thanks for that.
1477,1477,Don't mention it.
1478,1478,Get us out of here.
1479,1479,Now!
1480,1480,Come on!
1481,1481,"Come on, move faster!"
1482,1482,Come on! Go!
1483,1483,Get us in the air.
1484,1484,The flying gear's jammed!
1485,1485,Come on! Pull!
1486,1486,l'm trying!
1487,1487,Follow the spiders.
1488,1488,Follow the spiders.
1489,1489,"lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, l'll kill him."
1490,1490,"l mean, what was the point of sending us in there?"
1491,1491,What have we found out?
1492,1492,We know one thing.
1493,1493,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
1494,1494,He was innocent.
1495,1495,"Wish you were here, Hermione."
1496,1496,We need you.
1497,1497,Now more than ever.
1498,1498,What's that?
1499,1499,Ron....
1500,1500,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
1501,1501,Come on.
1502,1502,''Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land...
1503,1503,...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
1504,1504,Capable of living for hundreds of years...
1505,1505,...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
1506,1506,"Spiders flee before it.'' Ron, this is it."
1507,1507,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
1508,1508,That's why l can hear it speak.
1509,1509,lt's a snake.
1510,1510,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
1511,1511,Because no one did look it in the eye.
1512,1512,"Not directly, at least."
1513,1513,Colin saw it through his camera.
1514,1514,Justin Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
1515,1515,Nick got the full blast of it.
1516,1516,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again."
1517,1517,And Hermione had the mirror.
1518,1518,l bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
1519,1519,And Mrs. Norris?
1520,1520,"l'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
1521,1521,The water.
1522,1522,There was water on the floor that night.
1523,1523,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
1524,1524,''Spiders flee before it.'' lt all fits.
1525,1525,But how's a basilisk been getting around?
1526,1526,"A dirty, great snake."
1527,1527,Someone would have seen it.
1528,1528,Hermione's answered that too.
1529,1529,Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.
1530,1530,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
1531,1531,She died in a bathroom?
1532,1532,What if she never left?
1533,1533,Moaning Myrtle.
1534,1534,All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
1535,1535,All teachers to the secondfloor corridor immediately.
1536,1536,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message."
1537,1537,Our worst fear has been realized.
1538,1538,A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
1539,1539,The students must be sent home.
1540,1540,l'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
1541,1541,So sorry. Dozed off.
1542,1542,What have l missed?
1543,1543,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last."
1544,1544,My moment?
1545,1545,Weren't you saying just last night...
1546,1546,...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
1547,1547,"That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy."
1548,1548,"Your skills, after all, are legend."
1549,1549,Very well.
1550,1550,l'll just be in my office getting....
1551,1551,Getting ready.
1552,1552,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
1553,1553,Ginny Weasley.
1554,1554,''Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.'' Ginny.
1555,1555,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
1556,1556,At least we can tell him what we know.
1557,1557,"Professor, we have some information for you."
1558,1558,Are you going somewhere?
1559,1559,"Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable."
1560,1560,Got to go.
1561,1561,What about my sister?
1562,1562,Well....
1563,1563,"As to that, most unfortunate."
1564,1564,No one regrets more than l.
1565,1565,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now.
1566,1566,"l must say, when l took the job, there was nothing in the description You're running away?"
1567,1567,After all you did in your books?
1568,1568,Books can be misleading.
1569,1569,You wrote them.
1570,1570,"My dear boy, do use your common sense."
1571,1571,My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think l'd done those things.
1572,1572,You're a fraud.
1573,1573,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
1574,1574,ls there anything you can do?
1575,1575,"Yes, now you mention it."
1576,1576,l'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
1577,1577,"Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing."
1578,1578,l'd never have sold another book.
1579,1579,"ln fact, l'm going to have to do the same to you."
1580,1580,Don't even think about it.
1581,1581,Who's there?
1582,1582,"Hello, Harry."
1583,1583,What do you want?
1584,1584,To ask you how you died.
1585,1585,lt was dreadful.
1586,1586,lt happened right here in this very cubicle.
1587,1587,l'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
1588,1588,"l was crying, and then l heard somebody come in."
1589,1589,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
1590,1590,l don't know. l was distraught!
1591,1591,"But they said something funny, a kind of madeup language."
1592,1592,"And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked the door to tell him to go away and..."
1593,1593,...l died.
1594,1594,Just like that? How?
1595,1595,"l just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes..."
1596,1596,...over there by that sink.
1597,1597,This is it.
1598,1598,"This is it, Ron. l think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
1599,1599,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue."
1600,1600,"Excellent, Harry. Good work."
1601,1601,"Well, then, l'll just be...."
1602,1602,There's no need for me to stay.
1603,1603,"Yes, there is."
1604,1604,You first.
1605,1605,"Now, boys, what good will it do?"
1606,1606,Better you than us.
1607,1607,"But Obviously, yes."
1608,1608,Sure you don't want to test it first?
1609,1609,lt's really quite filthy down here.
1610,1610,All right. Let's go.
1611,1611,"Oh, Harry?"
1612,1612,"lf you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet."
1613,1613,"Thanks, Myrtle."
1614,1614,"Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
1615,1615,Go on.
1616,1616,This way.
1617,1617,What's this?
1618,1618,lt looks like a snake.
1619,1619,lt's a snakeskin.
1620,1620,Bloody hell.
1621,1621,"Whatever shed this must be Heart of a lion, this one."
1622,1622,"The adventure ends here, boys."
1623,1623,But don't fret.
1624,1624,The world will know our story.
1625,1625,How l was too late to save the girl.
1626,1626,How you two tragically lost your minds...
1627,1627,...at the sight of her mangled body.
1628,1628,So....
1629,1629,"You first, Mr. Potter."
1630,1630,Say goodbye to your memories.
1631,1631,Obliviate!
1632,1632,"Ron! Ron, are you okay?"
1633,1633,l'm fine.
1634,1634,Hello.
1635,1635,Who are you?
1636,1636,Ron Weasley.
1637,1637,Really?
1638,1638,And who am l?
1639,1639,Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
1640,1640,He hasn't got a clue who he is.
1641,1641,"lt's an odd sort of place, isn't it?"
1642,1642,Do you live here?
1643,1643,No.
1644,1644,Really?
1645,1645,What do l do now?
1646,1646,You wait here...
1647,1647,...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
1648,1648,l'll go on and find Ginny.
1649,1649,Okay.
1650,1650,"Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead."
1651,1651,"Wake up, wake up."
1652,1652,Please wake up.
1653,1653,She won't wake.
1654,1654,Tom. Tom Riddle.
1655,1655,"What do you mean, she won't wake?"
1656,1656,She's not...?
1657,1657,"She's still alive, but only just."
1658,1658,Are you a ghost?
1659,1659,A memory...
1660,1660,...preserved in a diary for 50 years.
1661,1661,She's cold as ice.
1662,1662,"Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up."
1663,1663,"You've got to help me, Tom."
1664,1664,There's a basilisk.
1665,1665,lt won't come until it's called.
1666,1666,"Give me my wand, Tom."
1667,1667,You won't be needing it.
1668,1668,We've got to go. We've got to save her.
1669,1669,l'm afraid l can't do that.
1670,1670,"You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, l grow stronger."
1671,1671,"Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
1672,1672,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
1673,1673,lt was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...
1674,1674,...Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
1675,1675,But why?
1676,1676,Because l told her to.
1677,1677,You'll find l can be very persuasive.
1678,1678,Not that she knew what she was doing.
1679,1679,"She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance."
1680,1680,"Still, the power of the diary began to scare her."
1681,1681,She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.
1682,1682,And then who should find it but you?
1683,1683,The very person l was most anxious to meet.
1684,1684,And why did you want to meet me?
1685,1685,"l knew l had to talk to you, meet you if l could."
1686,1686,So l decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid...
1687,1687,...to gain your trust.
1688,1688,Hagrid's my friend.
1689,1689,"And you framed him, didn't you?"
1690,1690,lt was my word against Hagrid's.
1691,1691,Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
1692,1692,l'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
1693,1693,He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
1694,1694,l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while l was still at school...
1695,1695,...so l decided to leave behind a diary...
1696,1696,...preserving my 1 6yearold self in its pages...
1697,1697,...so that one day l would be able to lead another...
1698,1698,...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
1699,1699,"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
1700,1700,"ln a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready."
1701,1701,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
1702,1702,Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
1703,1703,"For many months now, my new target has been you."
1704,1704,How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent...
1705,1705,...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
1706,1706,How did you escape with nothing but a scar...
1707,1707,...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
1708,1708,Why do you care how l escaped?
1709,1709,Voldemort was after your time.
1710,1710,"Voldemort is my past, present and future."
1711,1711,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
1712,1712,You're Voldemort.
1713,1713,Surely you didn't think...
1714,1714,...l was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
1715,1715,"No. l fashioned myself a new name, a name l knew wizards everywhere..."
1716,1716,...would one day fear to speak when l became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
1717,1717,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
1718,1718,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
1719,1719,He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
1720,1720,Fawkes?
1721,1721,So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
1722,1722,A songbird and an old hat.
1723,1723,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin..."
1724,1724,...against the famous Harry Potter.
1725,1725,"Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. lt only obeys me."
1726,1726,No!
1727,1727,"Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you."
1728,1728,"Yes, Potter."
1729,1729,The process is nearly complete.
1730,1730,"ln a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and l will cease to be a memory."
1731,1731,Lord Voldemort will return...
1732,1732,...very much alive.
1733,1733,Ginny?
1734,1734,"Remarkable, isn't it..."
1735,1735,...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
1736,1736,l'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
1737,1737,"You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry."
1738,1738,"Funny, the damage a silly little book can do..."
1739,1739,...especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
1740,1740,What are you doing?
1741,1741,Stop. No!
1742,1742,lt was me.
1743,1743,"But l swear, l didn't mean to."
1744,1744,"Riddle made me, and...."
1745,1745,"Harry, you're hurt."
1746,1746,Don't worry.
1747,1747,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
1748,1748,Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
1749,1749,"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
1750,1750,l just wasn't quick enough.
1751,1751,Of course.
1752,1752,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
1753,1753,Thanks.
1754,1754,"lt's all right, Ginny."
1755,1755,lt's over.
1756,1756,lt's just a memory.
1757,1757,Amazing!
1758,1758,This is just like magic!
1759,1759,"You both realize, of course..."
1760,1760,"...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules."
1761,1761,"Yes, sir."
1762,1762,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
1763,1763,"Yes, sir."
1764,1764,"Therefore, it is only fitting..."
1765,1765,...that you both receive...
1766,1766,...Special Awards for Services to the School.
1767,1767,"Thanks, sir."
1768,1768,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would..."
1769,1769,...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.
1770,1770,l believe we want our gamekeeper back.
1771,1771,"First, l want to thank you, Harry."
1772,1772,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
1773,1773,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
1774,1774,And...
1775,1775,...second...
1776,1776,...l sense that something is troubling you.
1777,1777,"Am l right, Harry?"
1778,1778,lt's just....
1779,1779,"You see, sir, l couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...."
1780,1780,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
1781,1781,l see.
1782,1782,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?"
1783,1783,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
1784,1784,"lf l'm not mistaken, Harry..."
1785,1785,...he transferred some of his powers to you...
1786,1786,...the night he gave you that scar.
1787,1787,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
1788,1788,Not intentionally...
1789,1789,...but yes.
1790,1790,So the Sorting Hat was right.
1791,1791,l should be in Slytherin.
1792,1792,lt's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
1793,1793,"Determination, resourcefulness..."
1794,1794,"...and if l may say so, a certain disregard for the rules."
1795,1795,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
1796,1796,Because l asked it to.
1797,1797,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly."
1798,1798,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
1799,1799,lt is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
1800,1800,lt is our choices.
1801,1801,lf you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor...
1802,1802,...then l suggest you look more closely at this.
1803,1803,Be careful.
1804,1804,Godric Gryffindor.
1805,1805,lt would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
1806,1806,Dobby.
1807,1807,So this is your master.
1808,1808,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
1809,1809,l'll deal with you later.
1810,1810,"Out of my way, Potter."
1811,1811,So it's true. You have returned.
1812,1812,When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter...
1813,1813,"...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
1814,1814,Ridiculous.
1815,1815,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them..."
1816,1816,...were under the impression that you would curse their family...
1817,1817,...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
1818,1818,How dare you!
1819,1819,Beg your pardon?
1820,1820,My sole concern has always been and will always be...
1821,1821,...the welfare of this school...
1822,1822,"...and, of course, its students."
1823,1823,"The culprit has been identified, l presume?"
1824,1824,Yes.
1825,1825,And?
1826,1826,Who was it?
1827,1827,Voldemort.
1828,1828,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else...
1829,1829,...by means of this.
1830,1830,l see.
1831,1831,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it."
1832,1832,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old schoolthings...
1833,1833,...should find their way into innocent hands.
1834,1834,The consequences for the one responsible would be...
1835,1835,...severe.
1836,1836,"Well, let us hope..."
1837,1837,...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
1838,1838,Don't worry. l will be.
1839,1839,Dumbledore.
1840,1840,"Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
1841,1841,Sir?
1842,1842,l wonder if l could have that?
1843,1843,Mr. Malfoy.
1844,1844,Mr. Malfoy!
1845,1845,l have something of yours.
1846,1846,Mine? l don't know what you're talking about.
1847,1847,"l think you do, sir."
1848,1848,l think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...
1849,1849,...that day at Diagon Alley.
1850,1850,"You do, do you?"
1851,1851,Why don't you prove it?
1852,1852,"Come, Dobby."
1853,1853,Open it.
1854,1854,Dobby.
1855,1855,Master has given Dobby a sock.
1856,1856,What? l didn't give Master has presented Dobby with clothes.
1857,1857,Dobby is free.
1858,1858,You lost me my servant!
1859,1859,You shall not harm Harry Potter.
1860,1860,Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
1861,1861,"Mark my words, Potter."
1862,1862,One day soon...
1863,1863,...you are going to meet the same sticky end.
1864,1864,Harry Potter freed Dobby.
1865,1865,How can Dobby ever repay him?
1866,1866,Just promise me something.
1867,1867,"Anything, sir."
1868,1868,Never try to save my life again.
1869,1869,"Welcome back, Sir Nicholas."
1870,1870,Thank you.
1871,1871,"Good evening, Sir Nicholas."
1872,1872,Good evening.
1873,1873,"Good to see you, Sir Nicholas."
1874,1874,Thank you.
1875,1875,Hello.
1876,1876,Hermione! Welcome back.
1877,1877,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas."
1878,1878,Harry. lt's Hermione.
1879,1879,"Welcome back, Hermione."
1880,1880,lt's good to be back.
1881,1881,Congratulations.
1882,1882,l can't believe you solved it.
1883,1883,We had loads of help from you.
1884,1884,We couldn't have done it without you.
1885,1885,Thanks.
1886,1886,"Could l have your attention, please?"
1887,1887,Before we begin the feast...
1888,1888,"...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey..."
1889,1889,...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered...
1890,1890,...to all who had been Petrified.
1891,1891,"Also, in light of the recent events..."
1892,1892,...as a school treat...
1893,1893,...all exams have been canceled.
1894,1894,"Oh, no."
1895,1895,Sorry l'm late.
1896,1896,The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
1897,1897,Some ruddy bird called Errol.
1898,1898,"And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron..."
1899,1899,"...and Hermione, of course..."
1900,1900,...l would still be youknowwhere...
1901,1901,...so l'd just like to say thanks.
1902,1902,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
