0,0,Dr. Meade!
1,1,"Oh, can you help me find Dr. Meade?"
2,2,"God, help us."
3,3,"God, save the Confederacy!"
4,4,"Hello, my fellow Americans."
5,5,They say we may have lost the battle but we didn't lose the war.
6,6,"Yes, my friends, we are under attack."
7,7,You may have read about this in your local newspapers or seen it on the evening news.
8,8,That's right.
9,9,We are living in an era marked by the spread of integration and miscegenation.
10,10,The Brown decision.
11,11,Ahahah!
12,12,"The Brown decision, forced upon us by the Jewishcontrolled puppets on the U.S. Supreme Court, compelling white children to go to school with an inferior race, is the final nail in a coffin..."
13,13,Is the final nail in a black coffin towards America becoming a mongrel nation.
14,14,We had a great way of life. We had...
15,15,"Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma!"
16,16,We had a great way of life.
17,17,We had a great way of life until the Martin Luther Coons of this world and their army of Commies started their civil rights assault against our holy white Protestant values.
18,18,Do you really want your precious white child going to school with Negroes?
19,19,"They're lying, dirty monkeys, stopping at nothing to gain their equality with white men."
20,20," Oh, my God."
21,21," Rapists, murderers, craving the virgin white..."
22,22," Is it ""virgin pure""?"
23,23, Yes.
24,24,"Rapists, murderers, craving the virgin pure flesh of white women."
25,25,They are super predators!
26,26,"And the Negro's insidious tactics, under the tutelage of highranking, bloodsucking Jews, using an army of outside northern black beast..."
27,27,"What is it? ""Black beast...""  ""Agitators.""  God, watch this! God!"
28,28,Using an army of outside northern black beast agitators determined to overthrow the Godcommanded and biblically inspired rule of the white race.
29,29,It's an international Jewish conspiracy.
30,30,May God bless us all.
31,31,"God bless you, too, sir."
32,32,Why weren't you drafted into the Vietnam War?
33,33,"I went to college, sir."
34,34,How do you feel about Vietnam?
35,35,"I have mixed feelings, sir."
36,36,Would you call yourself a womanizer?
37,37," No, I would not, sir."
38,38, You frequent nightclubs?
39,39," No, sir."
40,40, Do you drink?
41,41,"Only on special occasions, sir."
42,42,Ever done any drugs?
43,43,"Only those prescribed by my doctor, sir."
44,44,"Well, that's kind of rare for a young, hip soul brother like you."
45,45,"Uh, yes, sir."
46,46,"But my father was in the military, and my parents, they raised me the right way."
47,47,"How do you get along with people, generally?"
48,48,"Sir, they treat me right, I treat them right."
49,49,"Like I said before, I was raised up the right way, so..."
50,50,"I mean, have you ever had any negative..."
51,51,What would you do if another cop called you a nigger?
52,52,Or worse.
53,53,"Would that happen, sir?"
54,54,Shit...
55,55,There's never been a black cop in this city.
56,56,"Now, if we make you an officer, you will, in effect, be the Jackie Robinson of the Colorado Springs Police Force."
57,57,"And if you know anything about Jackie Robinson, you know he had to take a lot of, uh, guff from his fellow teammates, the fans, other teams and the press."
58,58,"I know the Jackie Roosevelt Robinson story, sir."
59,59,"Good. So, knowing that, if somebody calls you a nigger, will you be able to turn the other cheek?"
60,60,"If I had to, sir, yes."
61,61,"Yes, I would."
62,62,"Son, the mayor, the Chief and I think you might be the man to open things up around here."
63,63,Chief Bridges will be your Branch Rickey.
64,64,I'll have your back.
65,65,But I can only do so much.
66,66,The weight of this is going to be on you and you alone.
67,67,"Thank you for the opportunity, gentlemen."
68,68, Wow. Cybill Shepherd.
69,69, Yeah.
70,70,I loved her in The Last Picture Show.
71,71,Never saw it.
72,72,I don't like blackandwhite movies.
73,73,"So, what do you think?"
74,74,I think she's a really good actress.
75,75,"Oh, come on. You know you want some of that."
76,76,Looking for a toad here.
77,77,You're up.
78,78,"Give me the record for that toad, Maurice Smalls."
79,79,"While you're at it, grab another toad, Tippy Birdsong."
80,80,TIPPY.
81,81,Can I help you?
82,82,"May I have a minute, please?"
83,83,Sit.
84,84,"Sergeant Trapp, Chief Bridges, I'll get right to it."
85,85,I'd like to be an undercover detective.
86,86,"What, like Narcotics?"
87,87,"Whichever department works, sir."
88,88,"You just joined the force, rookie."
89,89,I think I can do some real good there.
90,90, Is that right?
91,91, I'm young.
92,92,There's a real niche for me.
93,93,Get in where I fit in.
94,94,"You think a lot of yourself, don't you?"
95,95,I'll do whatever it takes.
96,96,And I hate the records room.
97,97,Well...
98,98,"I think records is a good place for you to start, rookie."
99,99,"Chief, do you want me cleanshaven?"
100,100,I can even chop down the natural.
101,101,"No, no, no. You keep it."
102,102,I like the look.
103,103,I need a file on a toad.
104,104,You deaf?
105,105,I said I need a file on a toad.
106,106, No toads here.
107,107, Excuse me?
108,108,I said I don't have any toads.
109,109,I do have human beings.
110,110,"You give me their names, I'll get you the file."
111,111,"I heard you think you're hot shit, but you ain't nothing but a cold fart."
112,112,The name is Steven Wilson.
113,113,"Was that respectful enough for you, Officer Toad?"
114,114, Hello.
115,115, It's Bridges.
116,116,You sleeping?
117,117,"Uh, yeah, Chief."
118,118,Um...
119,119,Worked an allnight shift.
120,120,I've changed my mind.
121,121,You're coming in a little early today.
122,122,I got an assignment for you.
123,123,12:00 noon sharp.
124,124,Narcotics division.
125,125," Yes, sir."
126,126, Wear street clothes.
127,127,Thank you.
128,128,CP time?
129,129,"Jimmy, the rookie's late."
130,130," You're late, rookie."
131,131, Sorry. Won't happen again.
132,132,"We have limited time, so I'll be quick."
133,133,"The black radical, Stokely Carmichael, is giving a speech tonight at Bell's Nightingale."
134,134, Yep.
135,135, Carmichael is a former highmucketymuck with the Black Panthers.
136,136,"And as far as I'm concerned, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was dead right when he said the Black Panthers are the greatest internal threat to the security of these United States."
137,137,"This Carmichael joker, former Panther or not, well, they say he is a damn good speaker, and so we don't want this Carmichael getting into the minds of the good black people here in Colorado Springs and stirring them up."
138,138,"Ron, your assignment is to go to this speech tonight, infiltrate this bunch of subversives and just monitor the audience reaction to Carmichael's speech."
139,139, You ready?
140,140, Born ready.
141,141,I'm not ready.
142,142,Any chance this thing fucks up?
143,143,"Oh, fuck yeah."
144,144,Then what?
145,145, Just stick to the game plan.
146,146, Which is?
147,147,"Eh, improvise."
148,148, Like jazz.
149,149, Like bebop.
150,150,This isn't some big bust.
151,151,We just want some intel.
152,152,That's it.
153,153,And what if someone offers you a marijuana cigarette?
154,154, You mean a joint?
155,155, Yeah.
156,156,Mary Jane.
157,157,Excuse me.
158,158,"Soul brother, I'm already high on life. Can you dig it?"
159,159, It's dug.
160,160, My man.
161,161,And if someone pulls a gun on you?
162,162,Will that happen?
163,163, Barrel of a.45 in your face.
164,164, Shit.
165,165,Finger on the trigger.
166,166,Now what?
167,167,"Blood, get that gun out of my face."
168,168,"Peace, love and soul."
169,169,Gun is still in your face.
170,170,"I deescalate, talk calmly, firmly."
171,171,Find a way out of there ASAP.
172,172,Relax. We'll be outside listening in.
173,173, Okay.
174,174, Got it?
175,175,I got it. I'm gone.
176,176,Here we go.
177,177, We need to take action.
178,178, I can't believe he's here.
179,179,I just have so many questions to ask him.
180,180,"But, um..."
181,181,"How are you, uh..."
182,182,"How are you doing this evening, my sister?"
183,183,Can we help you?
184,184,"I'm doing fine, my brother."
185,185,What? We don't know him.
186,186,"What? Hakeem, why you dragging me?"
187,187,It's going to be an amazing night.
188,188,"Indeed, it is."
189,189,Have you heard Brother Kwame speak before?
190,190,Who?
191,191,Kwame Ture.
192,192,"Oh! Well, actually, I haven't, but..."
193,193, Okay.
194,194, I didn't realize he changed his name.
195,195,"Yes, after he moved to Africa."
196,196,"He took the names of Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and his mentor, SÃ©kou TourÃ© of Guinea, to honor the great leaders."
197,197," Well, that is heavy."
198,198, Mmmhmm.
199,199,You know how he got to Colorado Springs?
200,200,"Yeah, yeah."
201,201,The Colorado College Black Student Union invited him.
202,202," Oh, I can dig it. I can dig it."
203,203, Mmmhmm.
204,204,Are you...
205,205,Are you part of the Union?
206,206,I'm the president.
207,207,Really? I'm talking to the president right now?
208,208,"Yes, you are."
209,209,"Right on, sister."
210,210,"Well, I bought a ticket."
211,211,May I skip the line since I'm talking to the president?
212,212,There's no cutting in line.
213,213,To the back.
214,214,See you inside?
215,215,"I'll see you inside, my brother."
216,216, Mrs. President.
217,217, Right on.
218,218,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
219,219,The Black Student Union of Colorado College is honored to bring the vanguard of revolutionaries fighting for the rights of black people all over the world.
220,220,"Let's show some black love to the one and only, the brother man with a plan  who is sticking it to the man."
221,221," Right on, right on."
222,222,"Put your hands together, my people, for our Kwame Ture."
223,223,"Thank you, Sister Patrice."
224,224, Thank you.
225,225, And the Black Student Union.
226,226,"I want to thank all of you, my beloved sisters and brothers, for coming out tonight."
227,227,Okay!
228,228,But I'm here tonight to tell you that it is time for you to stop running away from being black.
229,229,Boomshakalaka!
230,230,It is time for you to stop running away from being black.
231,231,"You're college students, right?"
232,232, Right on.
233,233, That's right.
234,234,You should think.
235,235,"It is time for you to understand that you, as the growing intellectuals of this country, that you must define beauty for black people."
236,236, Okay!
237,237," Now, that's Black Power."
238,238,Let me ask you something.
239,239,Is beauty defined as someone with a narrow nose?
240,240, No!
241,241, Thin lips?
242,242,No!
243,243,White skin?
244,244,Hell no!
245,245, Hell no.
246,246, Hell no!
247,247,'Cause you ain't got none of that.
248,248,No. Okay.
249,249,Our lips are thick.
250,250, Yes.
251,251," Yes, they are!"
252,252,Our noses broad.
253,253, Our hair is nappy.
254,254, Yes!
255,255,"We are black, and we are beautiful!"
256,256, Yes!
257,257, Boomshakalaka!
258,258,"You see, we want to be so much like the white people who oppress us in this country."
259,259, Nope!
260,260," And because they hate us, and because we are ashamed of our African heritage, we then hate ourselves."
261,261,Preach.
262,262,Y'all don't hear me tonight.
263,263,We hear you.
264,264,Y'all dig Tarzan?
265,265,Tarzan. I'm gonna be honest.
266,266,"When I was a boy, I used to go to the Saturday matinees and watch Tarzan all the time."
267,267, Okay.
268,268," Yeah, yeah."
269,269,And white Tarzan used to beat up the black natives.
270,270,"And I would sit there, yelling, ""Kill the beasts!"
271,271,"""Kill the savages."
272,272,"""Kill them."
273,273,"""Kill them! Kill them!"
274,274,"Kill them!"" But what I was saying was, ""Kill me."" That's right."
275,275,It was as if a young Jewish boy saw Nazis taking Jews off to concentration camps and cheered them on.
276,276,"Today, I want those chiefs to beat the hell out of Tarzan and send his lilywhite ass on back to the caves of Europe."
277,277,Boomshakalaka!
278,278, Right on.
279,279,Right on.
280,280,But it takes time.
281,281,It takes time to become free of the lies and their shaming effects on the black mind.
282,282, Okay.
283,283," It takes time to reject the most important lie, that black people can't do the same things  that white people do..."
284,284, That's a lie.
285,285,...unless a white person helps them.
286,286,Talk about it.
287,287,Black Power also means that we must unite.
288,288,"We must unite, and we must organize to form a base to fight racism."
289,289, Okay!
290,290, Yes. Yes.
291,291,To fight our oppressors.
292,292,"The vast majority of Negroes around this country, they live in captive communities."
293,293,"And they must endure their oppression and their conditions, because and only because  they are black and powerless."
294,294, Educate. Educate.
295,295,And now...
296,296,Now we are being shot down like dogs in the streets by white racist cops.
297,297,Speak the truth.
298,298,I said we are being shot down in the streets by white racist cops!
299,299,Fuck the police.
300,300,We can no longer endure this kind of oppression without retribution.
301,301,Hell no!
302,302,No more.
303,303,"That war in Vietnam, it is not only illegal, it is immoral."
304,304, That's right.
305,305, Talk about it.
306,306,And you know what I tell them?
307,307,"Hell no, we won't go!"
308,308,"Hell no, we won't go!"
309,309,"Hell no, we won't go!"
310,310,We ain't going!
311,311,I'd rather see a brother kill a white racist cop than kill a Vietnamese.
312,312,"Me, too."
313,313,"Because at least, if he kills a racist cop he is doing it for a reason, because they are shooting black people..."
314,314, That's right.
315,315," ...in the backs, in these streets, right here in this very country."
316,316, They're killing us like dogs!
317,317, Boomshakalaka!
318,318,Right here!
319,319,Right here!
320,320,"I just want to leave you, uh, in closing 'cause I know it's getting late and y'all gotta go party."
321,321,"I'm sorry, study."
322,322,We love you!
323,323,"I just want to leave you, sisters and brothers, with these last words."
324,324,"If I am not for myself, who will be?"
325,325,"If I am for myself alone, who am I?"
326,326, Right.
327,327," Hear, hear."
328,328," If not now, when?"
329,329, When?
330,330,"And if not you, who?"
331,331,Who? Who?
332,332,Who? Who?
333,333,"We need an undying love for black people, wherever we may be."
334,334,All power to all the people.
335,335,All power to all the people!
336,336,All power to all the people!
337,337,All power to all the people!
338,338,"""All power to all the people."" Pretty powerful stuff."
339,339,"Incredible words, Brother Kwame."
340,340, Thank you so much.
341,341, Thank you.
342,342,"Thank you, brother."
343,343,Appreciate it.
344,344,Brother...
345,345,I gotta ask you something.
346,346,Do you really think war between the black race and the white race is inevitable?
347,347,Let me tell you.
348,348,"Arm yourself, brother."
349,349,"Get ready, 'cause the revolution is coming."
350,350,"Pick up a gun and arm yourself, because trust me, it's coming."
351,351, Thank you for coming tonight.
352,352, God bless you.
353,353,You looked great on that stage tonight.
354,354," Thank you, my brother."
355,355, All right.
356,356,"I don't know what you have planned now, but maybe I can buy you a drink?"
357,357,"Uh... I, uh..."
358,358,I gotta make sure Brother Kwame is all squared away...
359,359, What?
360,360, ...and he gets to his hotel safely.
361,361,I can dig it.
362,362,"But, you know, um, if it's not too late, maybe I can meet you at the Red Lantern?"
363,363,You know where that is?
364,364,Mmmhmm.
365,365,So I'll see you then.
366,366,Damn right. Yes. Cool.
367,367,All power to all the people.
368,368,Hey. How you doing?
369,369, Sorry I'm late.
370,370, Hey.
371,371,You won't believe what happened.
372,372,What are you having?
373,373,"Bro Pope, Pigs pulled us over."
374,374,Say what?
375,375,I don't want to see nothing but black asses and black elbows.
376,376,Spread 'em!
377,377,"You that socalled bigshot Panther nigger, aren't you?"
378,378,"I heard you was in town, Stokely."
379,379,My name is Kwame Ture.
380,380,I don't give two shits what your nigger name is!
381,381,"Black bitch, you get this Black Panther out of Colorado Springs before sunrise, you hear me?"
382,382, Or you'll all go to jail.
383,383, We were born in jail.
384,384,Ooh.
385,385,Don't touch me!
386,386, Don't touch her!
387,387, Get your fucking hands off of me!
388,388, Get your hands off of her!
389,389, Get your white hands off!
390,390,Keep your hands off of her!
391,391,"Come on, get your hands off of her!"
392,392,Get off of me!
393,393,Get off of me!
394,394, Wait!
395,395," Let her go, man!"
396,396,You see the officers' names?
397,397,"I know I should have, but..."
398,398,"The whole thing was so frightening, I didn't."
399,399,Come on.
400,400, Let's dance. Follow me.
401,401, Mmm.
402,402,"Come on. Come on, come on, come on."
403,403,What?
404,404,No.
405,405," Come on, you know it, you know it."
406,406, Uhhuh.
407,407,What was the room like?
408,408,Folks were hanging on every word.
409,409,Like a Baptist church on Christmas Sunday morning.
410,410, Huh.
411,411, Mmmhmm.
412,412,Sounds like he had them pretty riled up.
413,413,"But I don't think that means black folks were ready to start the revolution, Chief."
414,414,What makes you say that?
415,415,Nobody in there was talking about that.
416,416,That wasn't the vibe.
417,417,Everybody was cool.
418,418,Let me get this straight.
419,419,He told a room of black folk to get ready for a race war.
420,420,That they were going to have to arm themselves and kill cops.
421,421,"I mean, what about that?"
422,422,"Yeah, he said that, but, Chief, I think it was just talk, you know?"
423,423,Rhetoric.
424,424,"That's what I thought, too."
425,425, Jimmy?
426,426, Like my partner said.
427,427,"All right, well, thank goodness Carmichael has left Colorado Springs."
428,428, Kwame Ture.
429,429, What?
430,430,He changed his name from Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture.
431,431,"I don't care if he changed his name to that draft dodger, Muhammad Ali."
432,432,All right? He's still dangerous.
433,433, Did you hear the story Patrice told me?
434,434," No, I didn't."
435,435,About how the CSPD pulled over her and Ture?
436,436,"Patrice, she's the one from the Black Student Union, the group that brought in Ture?"
437,437,"Kwame Ture. Correct, sir."
438,438,"Getting pretty chummy with her, huh?"
439,439,"No, just doing my job, Chief. Undercover."
440,440,Let's just make sure it ain't under the cover of the sheets.
441,441,"I would never jeopardize a case, sir."
442,442,He doesn't know what he'd do.
443,443,You're new.
444,444,You guys sit tight.
445,445,"Ron, come with me."
446,446,"Ron, I'm transferring you to Intelligence."
447,447,What will I be doing there?
448,448,Intelligence.
449,449,Against my better judgment.
450,450,"Five, four, three, two, one."
451,451,Swish!
452,452,Police department.
453,453,He is at lunch.
454,454,"Excuse me? Yes, yes."
455,455,You have reached the Colorado Springs chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.
456,456,Please leave a message.
457,457,And God bless white America.
458,458,Hello. This is Ron Stallworth calling.
459,459,I saw your advertisement in the Colorado Springs Gazette.
460,460,I'm interested in receiving some reading materials from you.
461,461,My phone number is 1039994.
462,462,I'm very much looking forward to you returning my call.
463,463," Yeah, who's this?"
464,464, Ron Stallworth here.
465,465,This is Walter returning your call.
466,466,From the Organization.
467,467,The Organization?
468,468,That's right.
469,469,We appreciate your interest.
470,470,What's your story?
471,471,"Well, since you asked..."
472,472,"Since you asked, I hate niggers."
473,473, I hate Jews.
474,474, Huh?
475,475,Spics and Micks.
476,476,Dagos and Chinks.
477,477,"But my mouth to God's ears, I really hate those nigger rats."
478,478,"And anyone else, really, that doesn't have pure white Aryan blood running through their veins."
479,479,"My sister, Pamela, she was just recently accosted by one of those black coons."
480,480,Is that so?
481,481,Yeah.
482,482,Every time I think about that black baboon putting his filthy black hands on her pureaswhitedrivensnow body...
483,483,"I mean pure, Walter."
484,484,She's a saint. She's an angel.
485,485,It makes me want to puke.
486,486,You are just the kind of guy that we are looking for.
487,487,"Listen, uh, when can you meet?"
488,488,How about Friday night after I get off work?
489,489,"That's a deal, buddy boy."
490,490,We'll get right back to you with the details.
491,491,"Take care, now."
492,492,God bless white America.
493,493,Did I just hear you use your real name?
494,494,"Oh, motherfucker."
495,495,"Yeah, motherfucker amateur hour."
496,496,"That's your real name, right? Isn't..."
497,497,Isn't it Ron Stallworth?
498,498,"Right, isn't that his real name?"
499,499,Can't believe he just said that.
500,500,"Well, good luck, Ron, with your new redneck friends."
501,501,They want you to join the Klan?
502,502,They want to meet me first.
503,503, They want to meet you?
504,504, Mmmhmm.
505,505,"Yeah, well, you probably shouldn't go to that meeting."
506,506,"Good call, Sarge."
507,507,"So you're a crazy son of a bitch, huh?"
508,508,"We'd have to go to Narcotics, meaning we'd have to deal with Chief Bridges."
509,509,"Yeah, I can't spare the men."
510,510,"Well, I've looked over the logs, Chief, and it seems you can spare them."
511,511,"Sergeant Trapp, Ron spoke to the man on the phone."
512,512,"All right, when they hear the voice of one of my guys, they're gonna know the difference."
513,513,"How so, Chief?"
514,514,You want me to spell it out for you?
515,515,They're going to know the difference between how a white man talks and a Negro.
516,516,How exactly does a black man talk?
517,517,"Okay, Ron, what I think the Chief is trying to say..."
518,518,"If you don't mind, I'd like to speak for myself."
519,519," Thank you, Sarge."
520,520, Sure.
521,521,You know what I'm trying to say.
522,522,"Chief, some of us can speak King's English."
523,523,Others speak jive.
524,524,Ron Stallworth here happens to be fluent in both.
525,525,"Okay, Ron, how do you propose to make this investigation?"
526,526,"Well, I've established contact and created some familiarity with the Klansman over the phone."
527,527,"I'll continue in that role, but I'll need another officer, surprise, surprise, a white officer, to play me when they meet facetoface."
528,528,"See, that's my point exactly."
529,529,"Chief, black Ron Stallworth over the phone, white Ron Stallworth facetoface, so there becomes a combined Ron Stallworth."
530,530, Can you do that?
531,531, I believe we can.
532,532,"With the right white man, we can do anything."
533,533,"Anything happens to one of my men, there won't be two Ron Stallworths."
534,534,There'll be none.
535,535,You're late.
536,536,Sorry. It'll never happen again.
537,537,Seems like I heard that one before.
538,538,"Jimmy, when's the last time they let a rookie lead an investigation?"
539,539,"Oh, that's right... Never."
540,540,"Okay, all right, let's move on."
541,541,"Let's, uh..."
542,542,Let's go to our bio.
543,543,Okay. Ron Stallworth.
544,544,I do wholesale manufacturing.
545,545, Whereabout?
546,546, Pueblo.
547,547, What's that commute like?
548,548," Jimmy, I'm glad you asked."
549,549,It's a straight shot down I25.
550,550," Hour, tops."
551,551, It's a long ride.
552,552,What do we listen to?
553,553,"KWYD, Christian talk in the morning, although the signal starts to cut out near Pueblo."
554,554,"On the way back, I like to turn it to 102.7 to get my Allman Brothers fix."
555,555,"Only I have to change it every time that British fag, David Bowie, pipes on."
556,556,Whoa! I love Bowie.
557,557,"I mean, who doesn't, right?"
558,558,"Remember, you have to retain all the information you share with these guys so I can be white Ron Stallworth."
559,559,"Jimmy, I always wanted to be black."
560,560,All my heroes were black guys.
561,561,Willie Mays.
562,562, Basket catch.
563,563, Wilt the Stilt.
564,564,Record 100 points in one game.
565,565,But you know my absolute favorite?
566,566,O.J.
567,567,Heisman pose!
568,568, The Juice!
569,569, I love fucking O.J.
570,570,Orenthal James Simpson.
571,571, Bet you didn't know that.
572,572, Of course I did.
573,573,"We as a Negro people appreciate your love, but don't share that love with these guys."
574,574,"For you, it's the fucking Osmonds, right?"
575,575,"Hey, I love Marie Osmond."
576,576,"I get to play you, but you don't get to play me?"
577,577," Jimmy, does that sound fair?"
578,578, Fair?
579,579, Not to me.
580,580," Now, what else?"
581,581, Who are you meeting with?
582,582, Walter Breachway.
583,583,Become his friend.
584,584,Let's get invited back.
585,585,"Well, look at you."
586,586,"Okay. Anything else, sir?"
587,587,I'm on the phone with the Klan.
588,588,You meet with them in person.
589,589,And?
590,590,And you need to try and sound like my voice.
591,591,"Oh, boy."
592,592,All right. Here.
593,593," Me, too?"
594,594," Yeah. You, too, Jimmy."
595,595, Godfather.
596,596, That's right.
597,597,"You wanted to be black, here's your chance."
598,598,Lookie here.
599,599,Some people say we've got a lot of malice.
600,600,Some say it's a lot of nerve.
601,601,Lookie here.
602,602,Some people say we got a lot of malice.
603,603, Some...
604,604," Come on, come on."
605,605,This is life and death here.
606,606,Come on.
607,607," Oh, is it?"
608,608, Come on.
609,609,Some say it's a lot of nerve. Nerve!
610,610, You want me to do this now?
611,611," Please, now."
612,612,"For all our sakes, do it now, please."
613,613,Some say it's a lot of nerve.
614,614,"Let it flow, though."
615,615,Let it flow.
616,616, I'm flowing.
617,617, Okay.
618,618,I say we won't quit moving till we get what we deserve.
619,619,I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve.
620,620,"We've been buked, and we've been scorned."
621,621, We've been buke...
622,622," ""Buked."" Say that."
623,623," What does ""buked"" mean?"
624,624, Disrespected.
625,625,"You've been disrespected, Flip."
626,626, You.
627,627, Why doesn't he just say that?
628,628,"We've been buked, and we've been scorned."
629,629,"This has got to flow, from the..."
630,630,"We've been treated bad, talked about."
631,631,We've been buked.
632,632,We've been scorned.
633,633," All right, get that shit out."
634,634," We've been treated bad, talked about."
635,635,"Just as sure as you're born, but just as sure as it take."
636,636,Two eyes to make a pair. Huh!
637,637, Two eyes to make a pair.
638,638, Huh!
639,639,Hah!
640,640, Hah!
641,641, Hah!
642,642, Hah!
643,643, Huh!
644,644, Hah!
645,645," Brother, we can't quit till we get our share."
646,646,"Brother, we can't quit till we get our share."
647,647,"Doesn't make grammatical sense, but okay."
648,648,"Say it loud. I'm black, and I'm proud."
649,649,"Say it for O.J., Jimmy."
650,650,"You, too."
651,651,Say it loud.
652,652,"I'm black, and I'm proud."
653,653,Say it loud.
654,654,"I'm black, and I'm proud."
655,655,That's right. There it is.
656,656,I believed you.
657,657,Lose that Jewish necklace around your neck.
658,658,"Jimmy, it's not a Jewish necklace."
659,659,It's a Star of David.
660,660,Okay.
661,661,"Flip, you're Jewish?"
662,662,I don't know. Am I?
663,663,Ron Stallworth?
664,664,That's me.
665,665, You must be Walter.
666,666, Name's Felix.
667,667,"Well, I was told I'd be meeting a Walter Breachway."
668,668,"Change of plans, Mac."
669,669,I'm gonna need you to hop in the truck.
670,670,"Okay, well, how about I just follow you in my..."
671,671,No can do.
672,672,You come with me.
673,673,Security.
674,674,I'll drive you back.
675,675,"Come on, let's roll."
676,676,"You for the white race, Ron?"
677,677,"Oh, hell yeah."
678,678,Been having trouble lately with these local niggers.
679,679,"Ugh. Since the Civil War, it's always trouble with niggers."
680,680,Uhhuh.
681,681,Walter said something about your sister.
682,682,Makes me sick.
683,683,What are they saying?
684,684,They saying where they're going?
685,685,"But it's also, you know, camaraderie, I'm looking for with the Klan."
686,686,What the fuck did you say?
687,687, Camaraderie?
688,688," No, the other word."
689,689, The Klan?
690,690," Not ""the Klan."" It's ""the Organization."" The Invisible Empire has managed to stay invisible for a reason."
691,691,Do not ever use that word.
692,692,You understand?
693,693,"Hey, I overstand."
694,694,Right. You got it.
695,695,The Organization.
696,696,Check this shit out.
697,697,You're never gonna believe this.
698,698,What?
699,699,A fucking jig on our bumper.
700,700," Ron, he sees us. Back off."
701,701, Damn!
702,702,Let's get ready.
703,703,Look under your seat.
704,704, Yeah.
705,705, What?
706,706,Pull it out.
707,707,Load 'er up.
708,708,Put two in the chamber.
709,709,"Come on, load it up."
710,710,"Come on, load it."
711,711,Don't be messing with us.
712,712,The Organization.
713,713,"Not so fast, buddy boy."
714,714,Hold your horses.
715,715,Mmm!
716,716,"Ron, glad you could make it."
717,717,"Walter Breachway, chapter president."
718,718,Ron Stallworth.
719,719,I appreciate you inviting me out.
720,720,Absolutely. I've been impressed with our conversations over the phone.
721,721,I think you have a lot of fine ideas that could really help the cause.
722,722,"Well, I meant every word I said."
723,723,"You know, I've had my own share of runins with niggers."
724,724,"Matter of fact, it's what led me to the Organization."
725,725, Is that right?
726,726, It's become my salvation.
727,727,"See, I was, uh, shot and wounded by a couple niggers."
728,728,Then my wife was savagely raped by a whole pack of 'em.
729,729, God.
730,730," That's right,  and not a one of them went to jail."
731,731, Huh.
732,732,Tell you what.
733,733,They're taking over.
734,734,"Hell, it's all you see on TV anymore."
735,735,Niggers selling soap.
736,736,Niggers selling toothpaste.
737,737,Niggers selling automobiles.
738,738,"Everywhere you look, it's niggers, niggers, niggers."
739,739,"Yeah, wasn't long ago them sum bitches wasn't on no TV."
740,740,You're forgetting about Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.
741,741,Oh! Dang.
742,742,I kind of like them niggers.
743,743,Rice and pancakes.
744,744,"Hey, uh, my name's Ivanhoe, by the way."
745,745,Hey. Ron.
746,746,"Hey, all you get now is how we gotta cater to them."
747,747,"Now, watch your mouth. Yeah."
748,748,Don't say this.
749,749,Don't say that.
750,750,Be nice.
751,751,"Hell, they ain't even colored no more."
752,752,Negroes. Blacks.
753,753, AfroAmericans now.
754,754," Yeah, fuck it."
755,755,Just call them fucking niggers.
756,756,Make it fucking simple.
757,757, Niggers.
758,758, Niggers.
759,759,That's the right idea.
760,760,I've been saying this stuff for years.
761,761,"Well, you ain't the only one."
762,762,It's good to know someone else gets it.
763,763,"So, what kind of stuff you guys do?"
764,764,What kind of stuff we do?
765,765,"We, uh... Cross burnings and marches and stuff so people don't fuck with us."
766,766,I'm tired of niggers fucking with me.
767,767,"Well, then you come to the right place."
768,768,Nobody fucks with us.
769,769,"Now, how much you know about the history?"
770,770,Some. I could know more.
771,771,We will teach you.
772,772,"Yeah, this is fixing to be a big year for us."
773,773,How so?
774,774, Boom!
775,775, All right.
776,776,"We're gonna make fireworks, aren't we?"
777,777,"All right, all right, Ivanhoe, shut your dumb mouth."
778,778,"Ivan, shut the fuck up."
779,779, Burnt ends.
780,780," All right, all right."
781,781,That's enough.
782,782,Shut your dumb mouth.
783,783,Sorry about him.
784,784,He drinks too much.
785,785,Doesn't know what he's saying.
786,786,"Just to be clear, the, uh..."
787,787,The Organization is strictly nonviolent.
788,788,"Oh, nonviolent like that nigger, that dead nigger, Martin Luther Coon."
789,789," Yeah, gotcha."
790,790, Ron? You mind coming with me?
791,791,"Yeah, where to?"
792,792,You undercover or something?
793,793, You ask too many questions.
794,794, All right.
795,795,"Be friendly, now."
796,796,This is family.
797,797,All right?
798,798,Let's go.
799,799,Congrats. You passed the mustard.
800,800,How about we go and get that membership process started?
801,801, That's it?
802,802, That's it.
803,803,"Uh, have a seat."
804,804,"Go ahead and, uh, fill these out."
805,805,Send 'em to the national headquarters.
806,806,"Now, once they send you your membership card, you'll be able to participate in all our programs."
807,807,Alcoa can't wait.
808,808,I love those commercials.
809,809,"Imperial tax to become a member, $10 for the year, $15 chapter fee."
810,810,Robes and hoods are not included. That's extra.
811,811,Fucking inflation.
812,812,I can't thank you brothers enough.
813,813,This means a lot to me.
814,814,Pleasure's all ours.
815,815,"You're not a Jew, right?"
816,816,Jews killed Christ.
817,817,Are you trying to offend me?
818,818,Protocol.
819,819,Course I'm no stinkin' kike.
820,820,"All right, look, we gotta ask it, is all."
821,821,"But he's not a Jew, all right? Satisfied?"
822,822,Smells kosher to me.
823,823, Stop fucking around.
824,824, I fuck straight.
825,825, Who you fucking?
826,826, Double D!
827,827,"All right, both of you, give the man some space."
828,828,Jesus Christ.
829,829,Let him breathe a little.
830,830,"Ron, let me buy you a beer."
831,831, Okay.
832,832, Come on.
833,833,Sorry about these guys.
834,834,"They're a little, uh, too friendly sometimes."
835,835,They just get excited.
836,836,Yeah.
837,837, What kind of beer you like?
838,838," Coors, if you got it."
839,839,That was interesting.
840,840,Not exactly the Beverly Hillbillies.
841,841,They liked you.
842,842,Except for that Felix guy.
843,843,Do not ride his bumper like that.
844,844,Two car lengths.
845,845,You think he got a good look at my face?
846,846,Probably.
847,847,You get the papers?
848,848,They want you to join.
849,849,"Technically, they want you to join."
850,850,Yeah.
851,851,"Yeah, they want a black man to join the Ku Klux Klan."
852,852,I'd say that's mission impossible.
853,853,Double success.
854,854,We're in!
855,855,"Slow down, brother."
856,856,Slow down.
857,857,And exactly how much should we be worried about them?
858,858,Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.
859,859,"One of the men discussed plans for a possible attack, so..."
860,860,I wouldn't give him that much credit.
861,861,These guys like to boast.
862,862,What kind of attack?
863,863,"Uh, Ivan..."
864,864,"Ivanhoe said ""boom,"" mentioned something about fireworks."
865,865,"But personally, I didn't buy it."
866,866,I doubt they're even capable.
867,867,"Either way, at this point, we're looking for full support from the department on this, Sarge."
868,868,Let's move on with the investigation.
869,869,Let's try to find out if they are capable of anything.
870,870,Okay.
871,871," Thank you, Sarge."
872,872, You got it.
873,873,"When we dropped Brother Kwame off at the airport, he told me that the Black Power movement needed strong sisters like me to lead the fight against capitalist oppression and the politicians and pigs who perpetuate it."
874,874,His words almost made that whole pig nightmare worthwhile.
875,875,What's wrong?
876,876,What do you mean?
877,877,What's wrong?
878,878,I don't really use that word.
879,879,What word?
880,880,"""Pigs."" Well, what else would you call them?"
881,881,Cops.
882,882,Police.
883,883,Officers.
884,884,A bunch of racist cops on a power trip.
885,885,"So, you think all cops are racist?"
886,886,It only takes one to pull a trigger on an innocent sister or brother.
887,887,Hmm.
888,888,Why were you at Brother Kwame's speech?
889,889,He's got some good ideas.
890,890,"I don't agree with all of them, but he's a smart brother, definitely worth hearing."
891,891,Are you down for the liberation of black people?
892,892,Do we always have to talk politics?
893,893,What's more important?
894,894,Do you ever take time off?
895,895,No. It's a lifetime job.
896,896,"Sister Angela Davis, most righteous sister, can we please spend some quality time together?"
897,897,And what did you say your JOB is?
898,898,"Sister Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't."
899,899,Are you a pig?
900,900,Excuse me?
901,901,Are you a pig?
902,902,You mean a cop?
903,903,Are you a cop?
904,904,No.
905,905,I'm in construction.
906,906,"But more importantly, I'm a black man who wants to get to know a strong, intelligent, beautiful sister."
907,907,The very one I'm looking at right now.
908,908,You dig?
909,909,Sure enough.
910,910,That's what I'm talking about.
911,911,Power to the people.
912,912,All power to all the people.
913,913," That's right, sister."
914,914," Right on, right on."
915,915, This is Walter.
916,916, Ron here.
917,917,This is Ron?
918,918,"Sorry, your voice sounds different over the phone."
919,919,Uh...
920,920,My allergies...
921,921,Allergies acting up again.
922,922,I get those all the time.
923,923,"Listen, wanted to tell you that it was a real pleasure to have you swing by."
924,924,I think the brothers really took a liking to you.
925,925,I'm honored.
926,926,"If you're free Saturday, why don't you swing by Felix's."
927,927,You can meet the rest of the brotherhood. Hmm?
928,928,Sounds good to me.
929,929,"Well, I will see you then."
930,930,I've got a friend.
931,931,"He, uh, keeps up with these groups."
932,932,"He says they're moving away from the old violent, racist style."
933,933,"So, that's what Duke is peddling now."
934,934,"It's, uh, becoming mainstream."
935,935, Duke?
936,936, David Duke.
937,937,Current grand wizard of the Klan.
938,938,"But he's always in a threepiece suit, never seen in a hood or robe in public, and he now goes by ""national director."" So he's clearly got his sights on higher office."
939,939, Politics? How so?
940,940, Yeah.
941,941,Think it's another way to sell hate.
942,942, Keep going.
943,943, Think about it.
944,944,"Affirmative action, immigration, crime, tax reform."
945,945,Mmm.
946,946,He says no one wants to be called a bigot anymore.
947,947,I guess Archie Bunker made that too uncool.
948,948,"So the idea is, under all these issues, everyday Americans can accept it, support it, until eventually, one day, he gets somebody in the White House that embodies it."
949,949,Sarge...
950,950,Come on.
951,951,America would never elect somebody like David Duke president of the United States of America.
952,952,"Coming from a black man, that's pretty naive."
953,953,Why don't you wake up?
954,954,"Ron, hi. I'm Connie, Felix's wife."
955,955,It's so nice to meet you.
956,956,Oh.
957,957, Want to come right in?
958,958, Sure.
959,959," Do you mind if I, uh, smoke in there?"
960,960," Oh, not at all."
961,961,"I'm telling you, a war's acoming."
962,962,That'll be the end of the purified white race  as we know it.
963,963, They're right inside.
964,964,Just make yourself right at home.
965,965,It's time we go on the offensive.
966,966, We gotta make sure that everybody...
967,967," Hey, man."
968,968," Hello. Hey, fellas."
969,969, Welcome. Welcome.
970,970,"This is Ron, everybody."
971,971, Mr. Stallworth.
972,972, All right.
973,973, That's Mike.
974,974," Hey, Mike. How are you? Ron."
975,975, Scott in the back.
976,976, Ron. How are you.
977,977, Jesup.
978,978, Hey. How are you?
979,979," Ron, why don't you have a seat."
980,980," Sorry to interrupt, but I brought some cheese dip and crackers."
981,981,Would you like some?
982,982," Thanks, honey."
983,983, Thank you.
984,984, Walter?
985,985, Make them remember who we are and what we stand for.
986,986,We are the Organization.
987,987, We have to...
988,988, Oh! Oh! Oh! I read something in the Gazette that this nigger named Carmichael held a rally and that some college nigger girl from the Baboon Student Union was attacking our police.
989,989,"I mean, this girl is dangerous."
990,990,"She's like that Commie, Angela Davis."
991,991,And I just...
992,992,I think we should shut her mouth.
993,993,Here.
994,994,I cut the article.
995,995,That'll be all.
996,996,"Love you, sweetie."
997,997,"Someday, you're going to need me to do something for you."
998,998,Just wait and see.
999,999,And I will be right in here.
1000,1000,"Why don't we, uh, get back to our bread and butter."
1001,1001,"Let's talk about the next cross burning, which, Ron, you'll be lucky enough to attend if your membership comes in time."
1002,1002,It'll be a tremendous honor.
1003,1003, The highest hills get the most eyes.
1004,1004, Yeah.
1005,1005,Prove you can read.
1006,1006,"""Friday night last week, ""the Colorado College Black Student Union..."" Hey, Ron."
1007,1007,I gotta show you something.
1008,1008,"""...hosted a controversial talk featuring Stokely Carmichael ""at Bell's Nightingale nightclub."" ""Black Student Union."" ""Black Student..."" That go together to you?"
1009,1009,That sounds fucking weird to me.
1010,1010,Lookie here.
1011,1011,Wow. This is really something.
1012,1012,Here's my favorite.
1013,1013,I call this the Jew Killer.
1014,1014,I call it a Remington Model 1900.
1015,1015,"Indeed, it is."
1016,1016,Okay.
1017,1017,We about done here?
1018,1018,We got a few more items on the...
1019,1019,Not just yet.
1020,1020,Gotta make sure there's no Jew in him.
1021,1021,"All right, now you're just being offensive."
1022,1022,Okay? We're talking about someone who's gonna be our brother in a few months.
1023,1023,You see a Star of David around his neck?
1024,1024,Is there a yarmulke on Ron's head?
1025,1025,Just protocol.
1026,1026,"My house, my rules."
1027,1027,This way.
1028,1028,Where we going now?
1029,1029,I gotta show you something.
1030,1030,Tough titty.
1031,1031,"It's not necessary, Felix."
1032,1032,This is how we lose recruits.
1033,1033,You are going to take this lie detector test.
1034,1034, Take a seat.
1035,1035, What is this?
1036,1036,Is this your Jew den?
1037,1037,"Is this where you make your candles, you know, and your lampshades?"
1038,1038,"No, you're gonna take this lie detector test."
1039,1039,Open the damn door.
1040,1040,This is some lame bullshit.
1041,1041,"Lame or not, you're taking this Jew lie detector test."
1042,1042, Sit down.
1043,1043," Okay, Felix."
1044,1044,"Out of respect for this Organization, I'll play along with your little Get Smart bullshit, but I'm no fucking Jew."
1045,1045,Sit down.
1046,1046,Ask anybody.
1047,1047,They'll say I'm a real friendly guy.
1048,1048,"Thing is, I'm only friendly to my friends."
1049,1049,Not Jew friendly.
1050,1050,Damn sure not nigger friendly.
1051,1051," Me, neither."
1052,1052, Know what I think?
1053,1053, You think?
1054,1054," Oh, yeah, I think."
1055,1055,What do you think about?
1056,1056,This Holocaust stuff never happened.
1057,1057,That's the biggest Jewish conspiracy ever.
1058,1058,Eight million Jews killed?
1059,1059,Concentration camps?
1060,1060,Never happened.
1061,1061, Where's the proof?
1062,1062, Are you high?
1063,1063,I don't get high.
1064,1064,I drink.
1065,1065,'Cause I'd say the Holocaust is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.
1066,1066,It just makes sense to me.
1067,1067,You have a whole race of leeches that you have to get rid of.
1068,1068,"So, what do you do? You starve them, you burn them, you get rid of them."
1069,1069,It's like weeding out roots for the better people.
1070,1070, Haven't you seen the footage?
1071,1071, That's fake.
1072,1072,Jews run Hollywood.
1073,1073,Fucking hell.
1074,1074,Let me see your dick.
1075,1075,You gonna shoot me?
1076,1076,Put that gun away.
1077,1077,I hear you Jews do something funny with your dicks.
1078,1078,Some weird Jew shit.
1079,1079, Is your dick circumstanced?
1080,1080," Oh, is that what this is about?"
1081,1081,"You're trying to see my big Jew dick, you fucking faggot."
1082,1082,"Who you calling a fucking faggot, Jew faggot?"
1083,1083,"Now, put that fucking strap on your arm."
1084,1084,Put it on your arm!
1085,1085,Oh!
1086,1086, Felix!
1087,1087," Connie, what's wrong?"
1088,1088,Felix! Felix!
1089,1089," Connie! Connie, what's wrong?"
1090,1090, Felix! Felix!
1091,1091, Connie!
1092,1092, There's a black lawn jockey on our green lawn!
1093,1093, Felix!
1094,1094," I'm coming to you, honey!"
1095,1095," Shit, shit."
1096,1096, Felix!
1097,1097,Kill that son of a bitch!
1098,1098,"Yeah, keep driving, you black spear chucker,  piece of shit nigger!"
1099,1099, That son of a bitch!
1100,1100,"Fucked up the window, man."
1101,1101,Still want me to take your Jew detector test?
1102,1102,Everybody back in the house!
1103,1103,Back in the house now!
1104,1104, Shit.
1105,1105," Connie, you okay?"
1106,1106, You okay? Back in the house.
1107,1107, That's why we gotta get stronger.
1108,1108, That's some bullshit!
1109,1109," Back in the house, honey."
1110,1110,That's what I've been telling all you boys.
1111,1111,We need more guns!
1112,1112,Lie detector?
1113,1113,Shots fired?
1114,1114,You fucking kidding me?
1115,1115,It's a goddamn clusterfuck.
1116,1116,You dickheads are fucking with me.
1117,1117,You're jerking my chain.
1118,1118,You're jerking my chain.
1119,1119,I'm getting a reacharound from the Chief.
1120,1120,It's a big fucking circle jerk!
1121,1121, That's funny?
1122,1122," No, sir."
1123,1123,"'Cause if Bridges hears about this, this whole fucking operation's going to be closed down."
1124,1124,"Yeah, that's funny."
1125,1125,And I'm going to be a fucking school crossing guard in fucking the ghetto of Five Points!
1126,1126,"I mean, is he gonna hear about it, Sarge?"
1127,1127,Cocksuckers.
1128,1128,Hear about what?
1129,1129,"Hey, guys."
1130,1130,"Charles, can you give us five, please?"
1131,1131,Sure.
1132,1132,"I didn't want to say it with Trapp, but that peckerwood had a gun in my face, and he was an ass hair away from pulling the trigger."
1133,1133, And he didn't.
1134,1134, But he could have.
1135,1135,And then I would have been dead.
1136,1136,For what?
1137,1137,Stopping some jerkoffs from playing dressup?
1138,1138," Flip, it's intel."
1139,1139," Well, I'm not risking my life to prevent some rednecks from lighting a couple sticks on fire."
1140,1140,This is the job.
1141,1141,What's your problem?
1142,1142,That's my problem.
1143,1143,"For you, it's a crusade."
1144,1144, Mmmhmm.
1145,1145," For me, it's a job."
1146,1146,"It's not personal, nor should it be."
1147,1147,Why haven't you bought into this?
1148,1148, Why should I?
1149,1149," Because you're Jewish, brother."
1150,1150,The socalled chosen people.
1151,1151,You've been passing for a WASP.
1152,1152,"White AngloSaxon Protestant, cherry pie, hot dog, white boy."
1153,1153,Hmm.
1154,1154,It's what some lightskinned black folks do.
1155,1155,They pass for white.
1156,1156,"Doesn't that hatred you've been hearing the Klan say, doesn't that piss you off?"
1157,1157, 'Course it does.
1158,1158," Then why you acting like you ain't got skin in the game, brother?"
1159,1159,"Rookie, that's my fucking business."
1160,1160,It's our business.
1161,1161,"Now, I'm going to get you your membership card so you can go to the cross burning  and get in deeper with these guys."
1162,1162, Okay.
1163,1163,"Right, partner?"
1164,1164,"Wake up, white man."
1165,1165,The Negro wants your  white woman and your job.
1166,1166, Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me...
1167,1167,"The Jew wants your money, and this you..."
1168,1168,"Sorry, who am I talking to?"
1169,1169,"This is Ron Stallworth calling from Colorado Springs, Colorado."
1170,1170,"How are you today, sir?"
1171,1171,I'm quite well. Thank you.
1172,1172,"Uh, what can I do you for?"
1173,1173,"I desperately want to participate in my chapter's honorary events, but I can't until I receive my membership card."
1174,1174,Of course that's something I can help you with.
1175,1175,"Great. Um, who am I speaking with?"
1176,1176,This is David Duke.
1177,1177,Did you just say your name was David Duke?
1178,1178,Last time I checked.
1179,1179,Grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan?
1180,1180,That David Duke?
1181,1181,"Yes, that grand wizard and national director, yeah."
1182,1182,"National director, too, huh?"
1183,1183,"Yes, you're darn tooting."
1184,1184,That's amazing.
1185,1185,"I'm honored to be speaking with you, sir."
1186,1186,I'm not afraid to say it.
1187,1187,I consider you a true white American hero.
1188,1188,Is there any other kind?
1189,1189,"No, sir."
1190,1190,I'm just happy to be talking to a true white American.
1191,1191,Amen.
1192,1192,It seems like there's less and less of us out there these days.
1193,1193, Mmm.
1194,1194, Mmm.
1195,1195,"Now, about that membership card..."
1196,1196,"Yeah, Ron, I understand the situation."
1197,1197,"Uh, we've had some administrative problems here."
1198,1198,It's caused a little bit of a backlog.
1199,1199,"Tell you what, I'm gonna see to it personally that your membership card is processed, approved and sent out today."
1200,1200,How's that sound?
1201,1201,"Thank you, sir."
1202,1202,I can't express to you how much this means to me.
1203,1203,"Ron, please."
1204,1204,Pleasure's all mine.
1205,1205,"I look forward to hopefully meeting you in person one day, and, uh..."
1206,1206,"Well, God bless white America."
1207,1207," God bless white America, sir."
1208,1208," Okay, take care."
1209,1209,Excuse me.
1210,1210,Watch where you're going.
1211,1211,"You could get hurt like that, hot shot."
1212,1212,"The cop that pulled Kwame Ture over that night, was it Landers?"
1213,1213,How'd you know?
1214,1214,I can smell them a mile away now.
1215,1215,"What, do you got SmellOVision?"
1216,1216,He's been a bad cop for a long time.
1217,1217, Yeah?
1218,1218, Yeah.
1219,1219,"Few years ago, he shot and killed a black kid."
1220,1220, Jesus.
1221,1221," He said he had a gun, but he wasn't that type."
1222,1222,Why do you guys tolerate this?
1223,1223,You want to be the guy that rats him out?
1224,1224,You want to go to Landers' office now?
1225,1225,'Cause we're a family.
1226,1226,"And right or wrong, we stick together."
1227,1227,That reminds me of another group.
1228,1228,"That's a bull'seye, Ron."
1229,1229,You guys heard about this Hide N Seek room?
1230,1230,"Here, you got a decent bar turned into a filthy fag bar overnight."
1231,1231,Fucking fags everywhere these days.
1232,1232,They're trying to colonize.
1233,1233,"You know, first they get their own bars, then they want equal treatment."
1234,1234,Forget those fags.
1235,1235,Those guys Armytrained?
1236,1236,"A lot of us are, yeah."
1237,1237,Fort Carson myself.
1238,1238," God, I wish I had a scope on this thing."
1239,1239, Never seen those Macs before.
1240,1240, Steve and Jerry?
1241,1241," Yeah, who are they?"
1242,1242,That's classified information.
1243,1243,"Hey, Ron. I want to see what you can do  with my.45."
1244,1244, All right.
1245,1245,"Yeah, maybe you'll get that nigger next time."
1246,1246,Ooh.
1247,1247,Fifty bucks?
1248,1248, You got it.
1249,1249, I'll take that bet.
1250,1250,"Fuck, how about ten?"
1251,1251, Son of a bitch!
1252,1252," All right, where's my money?"
1253,1253, Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
1254,1254, Not bad. Hot damn.
1255,1255,"Well, my old man bought me a toy cap gun when I was a kid, and been shooting ever since."
1256,1256, That's a hell of a cap gun.
1257,1257, He can shoot.
1258,1258," All right, let's go."
1259,1259, Damn.
1260,1260,Pack it up.
1261,1261,"Ron Stallworth, motherfucker."
1262,1262,"Hey, Walter."
1263,1263,"Hey, I'm better than I used to be, right?"
1264,1264, I'm gooder than I was.
1265,1265," You're definitely doing a little bit better, but I don't think ""gooder"" is a word, but you're doing real good."
1266,1266,And Bernie Casey.
1267,1267, Ooh. Bernie Casey.
1268,1268, Brother's strong.
1269,1269,But Cleopatra Jones is the one.
1270,1270,It's about time we started seeing a strong sister like that.
1271,1271,"Well, Tamara Dobson did play a cop, right?"
1272,1272,"It's a black exploitation film, which is a fantasy."
1273,1273,Real life's not like that.
1274,1274,Real life is no Cleopatra Jones or Coffy.
1275,1275,"What, you don't dig Pam Grier?"
1276,1276,She's fine as red wine and twice as mellow.
1277,1277,"Pam Grier is doing her thing, but in real life, it's just pigs killing black folks."
1278,1278,What if there was a cop trying to change that?
1279,1279,From inside?
1280,1280,"Yes, from inside."
1281,1281,You can't change things from the inside.
1282,1282,It's a racist system.
1283,1283, You just give up like that?
1284,1284, No.
1285,1285,"We fight for what black people really need,  black liberation."
1286,1286," Right, right."
1287,1287," So, can't you do that from the inside?"
1288,1288," No, you can't."
1289,1289,The white man won't give up his position in power without a struggle.
1290,1290,What did Du Bois say about double consciousness?
1291,1291,Twoness?
1292,1292,Being an American and a Negro?
1293,1293,Two warring ideals inside one dark body.
1294,1294,"That's heavy, Patrice."
1295,1295,"I feel that, like I'm two people all the time."
1296,1296,But you shouldn't have to be.
1297,1297,We shouldn't have a war going on inside ourselves.
1298,1298,We should just be black.
1299,1299,"We're not there yet, though."
1300,1300,"Well, I'm tired of waiting."
1301,1301,I got a serious question for you.
1302,1302," Oh, yeah? What?"
1303,1303, Very serious.
1304,1304,Uhhuh.
1305,1305,Shaft or Super Fly?
1306,1306, What?
1307,1307, Pick one.
1308,1308,A private detective over a pimp any day and twice on Sundays.
1309,1309,All right.
1310,1310,Ron O'Neal or Richard Roundtree?
1311,1311,Richard Roundtree.
1312,1312,Pimps ain't heroes.
1313,1313,"Well, Ron O'Neal isn't a pimp, although he played the hell out of one."
1314,1314,That image does damage to our people.
1315,1315,"Geez, it's a movie."
1316,1316,Give it a rest.
1317,1317,I can't let it rest.
1318,1318,You jive turkey.
1319,1319," Who you calling jive turkey, jive turkey?"
1320,1320, I'm calling you a jive turkey.
1321,1321,I got a Tamara roundhouse coming.
1322,1322, Jive turkey.
1323,1323, It's coming...
1324,1324, It's coming around...
1325,1325, Get out of here with that!
1326,1326,Jive turkey.
1327,1327,Wrong address.
1328,1328,"Sorry to bother you, sir."
1329,1329,Have a good night.
1330,1330,Hello?
1331,1331,Hey.
1332,1332,"Sorry, had to work late."
1333,1333,How are you guys doing?
1334,1334,"Got a beer for you, Mr. Stallworth."
1335,1335, Thanks.
1336,1336, You got a twin.
1337,1337, What?
1338,1338, You got a twin.
1339,1339,Twin what?
1340,1340,A twin twin.
1341,1341,And your twin is a nigger.
1342,1342,Looked in the phone book.
1343,1343,Went over to what I thought was his place.
1344,1344,I found a nig there.
1345,1345,"Well, my number's unlisted."
1346,1346,What address did you go to?
1347,1347,Over on Bluestem Lane.
1348,1348,Bluestem Lane?
1349,1349,"No, I live on 21st Street."
1350,1350,What'd I tell you? Hmm?
1351,1351,Nothing to worry about.
1352,1352,"So, you don't know that nigger?"
1353,1353,Oh! That's that nigger I keep in the woodpile.
1354,1354,You're right. I thought you were talking about somebody else.
1355,1355,"No, I don't."
1356,1356,Come by sometime.
1357,1357,We'll have a beer.
1358,1358,And you know what?
1359,1359,"That loudmouth Black Student Union bitch that's been in the papers complaining about the police, she was there."
1360,1360,That fucking cunt?
1361,1361,Like to close those monkey lips permanently.
1362,1362,"Hey, don't say that."
1363,1363,Not until I get her lips around the head of my dick.
1364,1364,Can we play some goddamn poker now?
1365,1365,Are you done?
1366,1366,"Ron Stallworth, you enter..."
1367,1367,You entertain me.
1368,1368,"Entertain me a lot more than that oneeyed nigger, Sammy Davis, Jr."
1369,1369,"I'll say that, though."
1370,1370,They can dance.
1371,1371,They can dance.
1372,1372,I'll give them that.
1373,1373,About all I'll fucking give them.
1374,1374,We've got activeduty soldiers from Fort Carson.
1375,1375,Going to CID with that.
1376,1376,"Two mystery boys, Steve and Jerry."
1377,1377,Those are those fishy Army guys I was telling you about.
1378,1378,Old Klan crew.
1379,1379,Felix's old Klan crew.
1380,1380,Your buddy.
1381,1381,New Klan Walter.
1382,1382,Walter's a general without an army.
1383,1383,Felix's crew is stronger than his.
1384,1384,"Oh. Of course, Felix's wife, Connie."
1385,1385,It's crazy you've been talking to David Duke.
1386,1386,My ace boon coon running partner.
1387,1387,"Now that we got this, though, Ronny boy, I'm telling you, we're on a roll, baby."
1388,1388,This is it.
1389,1389, Holy shit.
1390,1390, Yeah.
1391,1391,"""Ron Stallworth, member in good standing for the year."
1392,1392,"""Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."" That's us."
1393,1393,Stallworth Brothers.
1394,1394,"Yeah, well, you don't have that little psychopath, Felix, staring at you, asking where you live."
1395,1395,"I'm Jewish, yes, but I wasn't raised to be."
1396,1396,It wasn't part of my life.
1397,1397,I never thought much about being Jewish.
1398,1398,Nobody around me was Jewish.
1399,1399,"You know, I wasn't going to a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs."
1400,1400,I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.
1401,1401,I was just another white kid.
1402,1402,And now I'm in some basement denying it out loud.
1403,1403,I never thought much about it.
1404,1404,Now I'm thinking about it all the time.
1405,1405,About rituals and heritage.
1406,1406,Is that passing?
1407,1407,"Well, then I have been passing."
1408,1408,I don't want that.
1409,1409,It sounds like they're watching us.
1410,1410,I don't know.
1411,1411,I was asleep. I don't know.
1412,1412,I don't know what we're supposed to do.
1413,1413,Look at this bullshit.
1414,1414,Where'd you find these?
1415,1415,"Plastered all over my windshield, but they're all over the neighborhood, too."
1416,1416,Is this real?
1417,1417,Real as can be.
1418,1418,Intimidation?
1419,1419,"Clearly, this is about the Black Student Union and you."
1420,1420, Me?
1421,1421," Well, you've been outspoken about the incident with the police when Brother Kwame was here."
1422,1422,"So, next, they'll have a burning cross out front?"
1423,1423,"All right, they're just trying to get to you."
1424,1424,"Intimidate, like you said."
1425,1425,Fear tactics.
1426,1426,"If you don't let 'em scare you, they got nothing."
1427,1427,But keep your eyes open.
1428,1428,"Be cool, okay?"
1429,1429,That's the damn problem.
1430,1430,We always too cool.
1431,1431,Way too cool.
1432,1432,"Well, maybe we should call the police."
1433,1433,How we know this ain't some of the KKK's honkypig partners passing out this shit?
1434,1434,Let me ask you...
1435,1435,Excuse us.
1436,1436, Let me ask you something.
1437,1437, Excuse us for what?
1438,1438,"""Cool."" Want me to be cool?"
1439,1439,I'll be cool.
1440,1440,"And it also safeguards against the CSPD, which is nice."
1441,1441,Yeah.
1442,1442,"Yeah, you soak the wood in kerosene and light a cig on a pack of matches."
1443,1443,It kind of buys you some time to get the fuck out before the cross catches fire.
1444,1444,Yeah.
1445,1445,Must be quite a sight.
1446,1446,"Oh, yeah, it is."
1447,1447,It's great.
1448,1448,It's a real bonfire.
1449,1449,"You can see it from miles away, you know?"
1450,1450,"Good visibility, as Walter would say."
1451,1451,"Freaks out the Jew media, and it, well, it keeps niggers on their nigger toes."
1452,1452,"Oh, look at that. Damn, there's another one."
1453,1453,"The pigs are out tonight, yeah."
1454,1454,Good job. Send another one.
1455,1455,Lot of these guys in the Army?
1456,1456,We got a couple.
1457,1457,"We got a few on active duty, yeah."
1458,1458,I just finished my second tour in 'Nam.
1459,1459, No shit.
1460,1460, Yeah.
1461,1461,My guy.
1462,1462,"Hey, Ron, do you happen to know anything about C4?"
1463,1463,You being in the military and all?
1464,1464,Enough to make shit blow up.
1465,1465,"...program dares to love white people, white heritage and white freedom."
1466,1466,This program also dares to expose  the Jewish supremacism...
1467,1467, Here come my boys.
1468,1468,Here come the cavalry.
1469,1469,...and the criminal banking establishment.
1470,1470,"These criminal bankers, the criminal Fed, the establishment is..."
1471,1471,"They're ethnically cleansing our people, not only in the United States."
1472,1472,Not only in the United States.
1473,1473,The only thing that we hear today from politicians...
1474,1474,"You all, cross burning is off."
1475,1475,"Too many cops, God damn it."
1476,1476,"""Right, thank you, black people."
1477,1477,"I love black people."" And, of course, every politician, every politician has to talk and genuflect to the real rulers of our society and say, ""I want to thank the Jewish people."
1478,1478,"""I love the Jewish people."
1479,1479,"""The Jewish people are always our friends ""no matter what they do, ""no matter how much they destroy our country."
1480,1480,"""It's just wonderful."
1481,1481,"You know, we just love the Jews."" And no senator or congressman would dare get up and say, ""I love white people."
1482,1482,"""I love white heritage."
1483,1483,"""I love my people, and I love the culture ""that was created in Europe."
1484,1484,"""And this great Western, Christian civilization."
1485,1485,"""I want to see that persevere."
1486,1486,"""You know, I want to see that be enriched."" A lot of people think I hate Negroes, but I don't."
1487,1487,"And the Organization doesn't, either."
1488,1488,They just need to be with their own.
1489,1489,That's what Pinky would say.
1490,1490,Pinky didn't mind segregation one bit.
1491,1491,She just wanted to be with her own kind.
1492,1492,Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.
1493,1493,You ever seen Gone with the Wind?
1494,1494,Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel.
1495,1495,She won the Oscar for that role.
1496,1496,"You know, Best Supporting Actress, so..."
1497,1497,"You were Scarlett, and she was Mammy."
1498,1498,That's right.
1499,1499, Right.
1500,1500, That's funny.
1501,1501,"When she passed, it was like..."
1502,1502,"Well, it was like we lost a member of the family."
1503,1503,A good nigger is funny like that.
1504,1504,"In that sense, they're like a good dog."
1505,1505,"They get real close to you, and as soon as you lose them, it just breaks your heart."
1506,1506,"That's well said, Ron."
1507,1507, I knew a coon once.
1508,1508, Did you?
1509,1509,"Yeah, that Negro lived across the street from us."
1510,1510,I must have been six or seven.
1511,1511,His nickname was Butter Biscuit.
1512,1512,How'd he get that nickname?
1513,1513,He loved his mama's butter biscuits.
1514,1514,"Yum, yum."
1515,1515,Me and Butter Biscuit played together every day.
1516,1516,"One day, my father came home early from work."
1517,1517,He told me I couldn't play with that little spook anymore because I was white and Butter Biscuit was a nigger.
1518,1518,That's so rich.
1519,1519,"Well, your father sounds like a terrific man."
1520,1520,He was a true American.
1521,1521,Taught me what was right.
1522,1522,This is why we need more people like you and me in public office.
1523,1523,Get this country back on track.
1524,1524,Amen.
1525,1525,For America to achieve its...
1526,1526,"Uh, its greatness again."
1527,1527,Absolutely.
1528,1528,"Boy, I sure wish we had a chance to chat facetoface."
1529,1529,"In due time, my friend."
1530,1530,"In due time, I will be in Colorado Springs for your initiation."
1531,1531,"You're coming to Colorado Springs, sir?"
1532,1532,You bet your Mayflower Society ass I am.
1533,1533,You're darn tooting.
1534,1534,"All right, I pulled the materials that you asked for."
1535,1535, Okay.
1536,1536, So you just move it around like this to see the images.
1537,1537,"Once you try it, I think you'll get the hang of it."
1538,1538, Okay? Got it?
1539,1539, Thank you.
1540,1540,"Okay, I'll be at the desk if you need anything."
1541,1541,Okay. Thank you.
1542,1542,Thanks for getting back to me.
1543,1543,"Listen, I think we need a new leader."
1544,1544,Someone everyone can unite behind.
1545,1545,I just don't think I'm gonna carry the votes.
1546,1546,"Felix would love to be the one, but I can't let that happen."
1547,1547,He's a crazy son of a bitch.
1548,1548,Goddamn loose cannon.
1549,1549,"No, we need someone articulate, someone... Someone who displays real leadership qualities."
1550,1550,And I think it should be you.
1551,1551,I gotta think about this.
1552,1552,"My father, he's sick, and he lives in El Paso."
1553,1553,I don't know if I can handle both.
1554,1554,Sorry to hear that.
1555,1555,Think about it.
1556,1556,"You're a smart and diligent man, and I've got no doubt that you could handle it."
1557,1557,I think it's time we get some new blood in here.
1558,1558, Yeah?
1559,1559, New ideas.
1560,1560,"For that reason, I'm planning to step down as your president."
1561,1561,But I would like to make a nomination.
1562,1562,Mr. Ron Stallworth for chapter president.
1563,1563,We just met this guy.
1564,1564,He just walked in off the street.
1565,1565,Let me ask a question.
1566,1566,Is there anybody here who's willing to put their neck on the line for Ron?
1567,1567,I'll vouch for Ron.
1568,1568,You know who else vouches for Ron?
1569,1569,Mr. Duke.
1570,1570,"Look, it's a big honor, but I... I can't accept."
1571,1571,"The trouble is, what you good men need is a president who will be constant."
1572,1572,"On call day in, day out."
1573,1573,My old man is sick.
1574,1574,I just found out.
1575,1575,So I'm going to be back and forth between here and Dallas.
1576,1576,"El Paso, Flip, El Paso!"
1577,1577,Thought it was El Paso.
1578,1578,It is. What did I say?
1579,1579, Dallas.
1580,1580," Which one is it, Ron?"
1581,1581,Make up your mind.
1582,1582,Dallas is where the layover is.
1583,1583,El Paso is where my father is.
1584,1584,"Dallas, that's where they killed that nigger lover, Kennedy."
1585,1585,Where you learned that?
1586,1586,I can read. I can.
1587,1587,"Well, we'll pray for your pop's health."
1588,1588,It's him.
1589,1589,"Hey, Ron, I don't share this  with a lot of people, but..."
1590,1590, Yeah.
1591,1591,"Well, I'm anxious to meet you."
1592,1592,"Excited to meet you, too, Ron."
1593,1593,"Aren't you ever concerned of some smartaleck nigger calling you, pretending to be white?"
1594,1594,No. I can always tell when I'm talking to a Negro.
1595,1595,How so?
1596,1596,"Take you, for example, Ron."
1597,1597,Me?
1598,1598,Yeah.
1599,1599,"I mean, I can tell that you're a pure Aryan white man from the way you pronounce certain words."
1600,1600,Can you give me any examples?
1601,1601,"Yeah, take the word ""are."" Pure Aryan like you or I would pronounce it correctly. ""Are."" Negro pronounces it ""areuh."" Did you ever notice that?"
1602,1602,"It's like, ""Areuh ""you gonna fry up that ""crispy fried chicken, soul brother?"" You know?"
1603,1603,Sorry.
1604,1604,Wow.
1605,1605,You are so white.
1606,1606,Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
1607,1607,"If you had not brought it to my attention, I wouldn't have noticed the difference between how we talk and how Negroes talk."
1608,1608,"Good, good."
1609,1609,Yeah.
1610,1610,I'd love to continue this conversation in Colorado Springs.
1611,1611,"It's beautiful here, sir. God's country."
1612,1612,"Well, that's what I hear, Ron."
1613,1613,"I look forward to meeting you, and, uh, we'll be talking real soon."
1614,1614,God bless White America.
1615,1615,Come back.
1616,1616," Oh, my God."
1617,1617, Who are you giving the finger?
1618,1618,Hello?
1619,1619,It's Felix.
1620,1620,Catch you at a bad time?
1621,1621,"No, not at all."
1622,1622,I'm just finishing a meal.
1623,1623,"Meeting, my house. Now."
1624,1624,"Ron, get your ass in gear."
1625,1625,And don't tell mealymouth Walter.
1626,1626,Welcome to the promised land.
1627,1627,"In about a week's time, we'll be welcoming Mr. David Duke to our city."
1628,1628," Oh, yeah."
1629,1629, Who's packing tonight?
1630,1630,I'm packing.
1631,1631,Amen.
1632,1632,"Where's your piece, Ron?"
1633,1633,"Well, you know, I don't carry it on me all the time."
1634,1634,"""Don't carry."" No, that..."
1635,1635,I got you covered.
1636,1636,Won't happen again.
1637,1637,We're gonna need your good shot come next Sunday.
1638,1638,Why? What's next Sunday?
1639,1639,The war is gonna come to us.
1640,1640,"Well, fuck yeah."
1641,1641,Looks like we got ourselves another soldier.
1642,1642,"Just make sure that when you're at the steakhouse, you got your new friend with you."
1643,1643,"And, Ron, you're gonna want to name your piece."
1644,1644,This is Betsey.
1645,1645, Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.
1646,1646, I'm sorry.
1647,1647,Don't fucking point the gun at anybody ever.
1648,1648,I know what I'm doing.
1649,1649,I know how to use this thing.
1650,1650, Honey. Do you ever have second thoughts?
1651,1651, Mmmhmm.
1652,1652,About what?
1653,1653,Killing them.
1654,1654,Never think twice about killing niggers.
1655,1655,"You won't be able to take it back, though."
1656,1656,"They're the first of many niggers  that must die, honey bun."
1657,1657, I know. It's just becoming so real.
1658,1658,I always thought it would be like a dream.
1659,1659,I know.
1660,1660,It's just so beautiful.
1661,1661,We're cleansing this country of a backwards race of chimpanzees.
1662,1662,First the spooks.
1663,1663,Then the kikes.
1664,1664,"Free at last, free at last."
1665,1665,"Thank God Almighty, free of them niggers at last."
1666,1666,"I love it when you do that, honey."
1667,1667,Mmm.
1668,1668,"We've talked about killing niggers for so many years, and now it's really happening."
1669,1669,Hmm.
1670,1670,My old man always told me good things come to those who wait.
1671,1671,Mmm.
1672,1672,Thank you for bringing me into your life.
1673,1673,For loving me like you do.
1674,1674,"For giving me a purpose, direction."
1675,1675,This could be the new Boston Tea Party.
1676,1676,Mmm.
1677,1677,Mr. Stallworth.
1678,1678,Pleased to meet you.
1679,1679,Names of chapter members?
1680,1680,What is this about?
1681,1681,Two names on your list work at NORAD.
1682,1682,"The two mystery men, Steve and Jerry?"
1683,1683,Real names are Harry Dricks and Kevin Nelson.
1684,1684,Two clowns with top security clearances.
1685,1685,These Klansmen are in charge of monitoring our safety.
1686,1686,You've done a service to your country.
1687,1687,We've been following your investigation.
1688,1688,Impressive.
1689,1689,"Last night, Fort Carson reported several C4 explosives missing from their armory."
1690,1690, No suspects.
1691,1691, Klan?
1692,1692,"Wait, the KKK and the United States Army?"
1693,1693,"You won't see this on the news for obvious reasons, but thought it might be of interest to you."
1694,1694,"If you know about a possible attack, I need to know when."
1695,1695,You're the one with the impressive investigation.
1696,1696,But can't you or the FBI chip in?
1697,1697,Sir?
1698,1698,FBI?
1699,1699,Federal Bureau of Investigation?
1700,1700,We never had this conversation.
1701,1701,"You can hate me all you want, all right?"
1702,1702,Just promise me you won't go to that protest.
1703,1703,I'm going. We're going.
1704,1704,What are you talking about?
1705,1705,"I can't get into specifics, but today the Klan is planning an attack."
1706,1706, Then we have to tell the people.
1707,1707, It's not an option.
1708,1708,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1709,1709,What's wrong with you?
1710,1710,No one else can know while it's an active investigation.
1711,1711,Active investigation?
1712,1712,"And pray tell, how do you know that?"
1713,1713,Are you a pig?
1714,1714, No.
1715,1715," What are you, then?"
1716,1716,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1717,1717,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1718,1718,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1719,1719,Want to sit?
1720,1720,No. I'll stand.
1721,1721,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1722,1722,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1723,1723,I'm an undercover detective.
1724,1724,I'm investigating the Klan.
1725,1725,Fucking KKK?
1726,1726,"Ron Stallworth, you lied to me."
1727,1727,Is that even your real name?
1728,1728,Ron Stallworth is my first and last name.
1729,1729,"Look, today is not the day, Patrice."
1730,1730,I take my duties as the president of the Black Student Union seriously.
1731,1731,"Well, how much good did it do?"
1732,1732,"You could sit in the middle of Nevada Avenue, light yourself on fire, the KKK will still be here."
1733,1733,"Well, at least I would be doing something, unlike you."
1734,1734, Unlike me?
1735,1735, Yeah.
1736,1736,"Don't think, just because I don't wear a black beret or a black leather jacket, black RayBans, screaming, ""Kill Whitey,"" that I don't care about my people."
1737,1737,"The night we saw Brother Kwame speak, were you undercover then, too?"
1738,1738,That's not fair.
1739,1739, You have to understand...
1740,1740, Answer the question.
1741,1741,Were you undercover the night we met? Yes or no?
1742,1742,"Ron Stallworth, are you for the revolution and the liberation of black people?"
1743,1743,I'm an undercover detective for the Colorado Springs Police.
1744,1744,It's my JOB.
1745,1745,That's the truth.
1746,1746,"House niggers said they had a JOB, too."
1747,1747,You disgust me.
1748,1748,"My brother, you need to wake up."
1749,1749,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1750,1750,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1751,1751,Are you fucking kidding me?
1752,1752,You don't cross those lines.
1753,1753,"This is about an investigation, not a relationship."
1754,1754,Hate to break that blue wall of silence.
1755,1755,Nice one.
1756,1756, Is Patrice really in danger?
1757,1757, Maybe.
1758,1758,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1759,1759,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
1760,1760,It's off.
1761,1761,Yep.
1762,1762,You'll know soon enough.
1763,1763,What?
1764,1764,Felix just said the march has been canceled.
1765,1765, Why?
1766,1766, Could be all the death threats.
1767,1767,"No, they're used to that."
1768,1768,And there's been nothing more about the explosives?
1769,1769,No.
1770,1770,Fuck it.
1771,1771,We get them on weapons charges and stop them from doing anything that way.
1772,1772,"Then what? You know, misdemeanor at best."
1773,1773, Then they walk.
1774,1774, I have a special assignment for Ron.
1775,1775,Ron already has an assignment.
1776,1776,"Yeah, what could be more important than preventing an attack, sir?"
1777,1777,We have very credible threats against David Duke's life.
1778,1778,"So, Ron, I am assigning you security detail  for David Duke."
1779,1779, What?
1780,1780,"With all due respect, sir, I don't think this is a wise decision, given the situation."
1781,1781,Who cares what you think?
1782,1782,Duke needs protection.
1783,1783,There's no one else available.
1784,1784,Nutcracking time.
1785,1785,Put aside your personal politics.
1786,1786,"Chief, it's not about that, and you know it."
1787,1787,David Duke and Ron have been talking on the phone several times.
1788,1788,If he recognizes his voice...
1789,1789,"If any of the Klansmen do, it'll compromise our entire investigation."
1790,1790, It's too dangerous.
1791,1791," Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you boast to me that you were fluent in both English and jive?"
1792,1792, Do you remember that?
1793,1793, Answer the Chief.
1794,1794,"Oh, shut the fuck up, Landers."
1795,1795,"You know, you've been trying to sabotage me since day one."
1796,1796,"Why are you getting so worked up, boy?"
1797,1797," Hey, Ron!"
1798,1798," Hey, Ron, come on."
1799,1799," Ron, Ron, no! Ron!"
1800,1800, It's not worth it.
1801,1801," Okay, okay, all right."
1802,1802, Just...
1803,1803," Go, go, go."
1804,1804, Stay put.
1805,1805," Ron. Whoa, whoa!"
1806,1806, What the fuck is that?
1807,1807,"Gotta bring something to get something, Landers."
1808,1808,Eat a white dick!
1809,1809,You let him get to you that easy?
1810,1810,You don't have a shot with David Duke.
1811,1811,"First, the primary target."
1812,1812,Felix says you're doing it.
1813,1813,"So all you have to do is set the pocketbook on the front porch, the back porch, a sidewalk."
1814,1814,Doesn't matter.
1815,1815,"As long as it's against the building, you can plant it anywhere."
1816,1816,I got enough C4 here to take out the whole thing.
1817,1817,Be careful.
1818,1818, You understand?
1819,1819, I understand.
1820,1820,All you have to do when you placed it...
1821,1821,"Hey, sweetie. You listening?"
1822,1822,All you have to do when you placed it is flip the switch.
1823,1823,Flip the switch.
1824,1824,That's it.
1825,1825,You got it?
1826,1826,Miss Black Student Union Bitch is bringing in some old coon to speak.
1827,1827,Place should be packed.
1828,1828,"So, Brother Walker, nothing but rubble."
1829,1829,And barbecued niggers.
1830,1830, And what happens if that don't work?
1831,1831, Plan B.
1832,1832,"Can you handle it, honey?"
1833,1833,You can count on me.
1834,1834,I've been waiting to do my part.
1835,1835,Sweet as candy.
1836,1836,"Ah, look at the lovebirds."
1837,1837,Can I feel the C4?
1838,1838,No C4 for you.
1839,1839,You'll blow us all the fuck up to kingdom come.
1840,1840, What is this black...
1841,1841, Out here with  the great David Duke.
1842,1842, Look at this fucking guy.
1843,1843,How's he getting away with that?
1844,1844,Mr. Duke's security detail.
1845,1845, What?
1846,1846, Fuck this guy.
1847,1847,Mr. Duke.
1848,1848,I'm a detective from the Colorado Springs Police Department.
1849,1849,I'm here to keep you safe today.
1850,1850," I'm sorry, have we met before?"
1851,1851, Mmmmmm.
1852,1852,You may know that there's several credible threats against your life.
1853,1853,How's it going out here?
1854,1854,"There have been threats on my life, and this is the detective they've assigned as my bodyguard."
1855,1855,"Mr. Duke, I don't agree with your philosophies."
1856,1856,"However, I'm a professional, so I will do everything within my means and beyond  to make sure you're safe."
1857,1857," Okay, I appreciate your professionalism."
1858,1858,"Allow me, sir."
1859,1859,Thank you.
1860,1860," Right this way, sir."
1861,1861, Walt.
1862,1862, Bro. How are you?
1863,1863, Sir.
1864,1864,Sorry for all the extra security today.
1865,1865,Can't be too careful.
1866,1866,"Yeah, I know."
1867,1867,"We have a strong, strong..."
1868,1868,"Hey, fellas."
1869,1869,"Yeah, like you were saying, last week on the phone..."
1870,1870,"Well, Mr. Duke."
1871,1871,"I would like you to meet our newest recruit, Ron Stallworth."
1872,1872,"Ron Stallworth, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person."
1873,1873,Same. Same.
1874,1874,You as well.
1875,1875,"This is our brother, Jesse."
1876,1876, I'm Jesse.
1877,1877," Hey, Jesse."
1878,1878, Ron.
1879,1879," Ron, yeah."
1880,1880, I've heard so much about you.
1881,1881," Oh, okay."
1882,1882,I didn't realize how nervous I was gonna be.
1883,1883,That's all right.
1884,1884,What's that doing here?
1885,1885,That's the fucking cop they got to guard Mr. Duke.
1886,1886,Isn't that the living shit?
1887,1887,"Gentlemen, it's time."
1888,1888," Ron, why don't you follow me?"
1889,1889, Okay.
1890,1890,Let's go. Let's go.
1891,1891,You stay right here.
1892,1892,You hear?
1893,1893,"God, America's going to hell in a handbasket."
1894,1894,"That started out as a nice spring day back there in Waco, Texas."
1895,1895,"May 15, 1916."
1896,1896,Jesse Washington...
1897,1897,Was a friend of mine.
1898,1898,He was 17.
1899,1899,I was 18.
1900,1900,We kind of looked at Jesse and called him slow.
1901,1901,"Today, you'd call him mentally retarded."
1902,1902,They claimed Jesse raped and murdered a white woman by the name of Lucy Fryer.
1903,1903,"They put Jesse on trial, and he was convicted by an allwhite jury after they deliberated for only four minutes."
1904,1904,"My brothers in Christ, Nobel Prize recipient, cocreator of the transistor and a dear, dear friend of mine, Dr. William Shockley, whose groundbreaking scientific work ushered in the computer age, has proven, through his research with eugenics, that each of us here has flowing through our veins the genes of a superior race."
1905,1905,It's a fact.
1906,1906,It's a fact.
1907,1907,It can't be disputed.
1908,1908,"Today, we celebrate that truth."
1909,1909,"Masks off, hoods on."
1910,1910,I was working across the street at the shoeshine parlor.
1911,1911,"And after the verdict, a mob grabbed Jesse, put a chain around his neck and dragged him out of the courthouse."
1912,1912,"Oh, my God."
1913,1913,I knew I had to hide.
1914,1914,That way.
1915,1915,"Be careful, brother."
1916,1916,"Well, all right."
1917,1917,"Where I was, the shoe parlor had a window up in the attic."
1918,1918,And I could see the crowd.
1919,1919,They marched Jesse through the streets.
1920,1920,They stabbed him and beat him.
1921,1921,Oh!
1922,1922,"And finally, in a bloody heap, they held him down in the street and cut off his testicles."
1923,1923,"God, give us true white men."
1924,1924,"The Invisible Empire demands strong minds, great hearts, true faith, clean and ready hands."
1925,1925,Men who have honor.
1926,1926,Men who will not lie.
1927,1927,Men who can stand before a demagogue and damn his treacherous flatteries without blinking.
1928,1928,"God, give us real men."
1929,1929,Courageous men who flinch not at duty.
1930,1930,"Men of dependable character, men of sterling worth."
1931,1931,"Then wrongs will be redressed, and right shall rule the Earth."
1932,1932,"God, give us true white men."
1933,1933,Ron Stallworth.
1934,1934,Rise.
1935,1935,Step forward.
1936,1936,The police and the city officials were out there watching him.
1937,1937, They cut off his fingers.
1938,1938, Oh!
1939,1939,And threw coal oil all over his body.
1940,1940,They lit a bonfire and raised him and lowered him over these flames over and over and over again.
1941,1941,"Ron Stallworth, are you a white, nonJewish American citizen?"
1942,1942,Yes.
1943,1943,Yes what?
1944,1944,"Yes, I am a white, nonJewish American citizen."
1945,1945,Are you in favor of a white man's government  in this country?
1946,1946, Yes.
1947,1947,"Ron Stallworth, are you willing to dedicate your life to the protection, the preservation and the advancement of the white race in mind, in body  and in spirit?"
1948,1948, Yes.
1949,1949,Be seated.
1950,1950,The mayor had a photographer by the name of Gildersleeve.
1951,1951,He came and took pictures of the whole thing.
1952,1952,Those pictures were later sold as postcards.
1953,1953,Remove your hood.
1954,1954,They put Jesse's charred body into a bag.
1955,1955,Remove your hood.
1956,1956,Dragged him through town.
1957,1957,Remove your hood.
1958,1958,They sold the remains.
1959,1959,Remove your hood.
1960,1960,As souvenirs.
1961,1961,Remove your hood.
1962,1962,Lot of good white folks just stood there like it was a Fourth of July parade.
1963,1963,They even let the children out of school on lunch hour.
1964,1964,Remove your hood.
1965,1965,And all I could do was to watch and hope they wouldn't find me.
1966,1966,Come.
1967,1967,Welcome your brethren who have been baptized by the light.
1968,1968, Please.
1969,1969," Oh, my God!"
1970,1970,Let's give them some applause!
1971,1971,One of the reasons they had done that to Jesse was a movie called Birth of a Nation.
1972,1972,"It had come out the year before, and it was so powerful that it gave the Ku Klux Klan a rebirth."
1973,1973,"Oh, God. Oh, my God."
1974,1974,"Oh, my God. No!"
1975,1975,No!
1976,1976,"Oh, look at that one!"
1977,1977,"Oh, he's disgusting."
1978,1978,Oh!
1979,1979,"Oh, those poor women."
1980,1980,Don't you do it!
1981,1981, Why?
1982,1982, No.
1983,1983,No.
1984,1984,The ingenuity of white women!
1985,1985,"Today, they would call that kind of movie a blockbuster."
1986,1986,Everybody saw it.
1987,1987,That's disgusting.
1988,1988,"Even the president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, showed it at the White House."
1989,1989,"And he said that it was ""history written with lightning."" What... What is really..."
1990,1990,"Oh, look at that little pickaninny."
1991,1991,"Watch, watch. They're gonna scare the pickaninnies."
1992,1992,Get out of there!
1993,1993, Move. Move.
1994,1994, Get out of there!
1995,1995,The inspiration!
1996,1996,Get 'em out of there!
1997,1997, Go get 'em!
1998,1998, Go!
1999,1999,Go get 'em!
2000,2000,Hey!
2001,2001, Send him to hell!
2002,2002, String him up!
2003,2003,String him up!
2004,2004,Guilty!
2005,2005,Get him on that horse.
2006,2006,Get him up!
2007,2007,String him up!
2008,2008,Yeah!
2009,2009,White power!
2010,2010,White power! White power!
2011,2011,That's why we're here today.
2012,2012,In the name of Black Power.
2013,2013, Yes.
2014,2014, Black Power. Black Power.
2015,2015,Black Power! Black Power!
2016,2016,Black Power! Black Power!
2017,2017,Black Power!
2018,2018,I'd like you to do me a favor and just look around.
2019,2019,That's right.
2020,2020,Everyone just look around.
2021,2021,"Today, we are privileged to be among white men."
2022,2022,And white women.
2023,2023,Such as yourselves.
2024,2024,Real warriors.
2025,2025,For the real America.
2026,2026,The America that our ancestors fought and died for.
2027,2027,The true white American race.
2028,2028,The backbone from whence came our great Southern heritage.
2029,2029,And I want to thank you.
2030,2030,Jesus Christ.
2031,2031,I want to thank you so much for never putting your country second.
2032,2032, That's right.
2033,2033, Hmm.
2034,2034, America first.
2035,2035, America first.
2036,2036,America first.
2037,2037,America first!
2038,2038,America first!
2039,2039,Ain't this a bitch.
2040,2040,"If I would have known this was a Klan meeting, I wouldn't have taken this motherfucking gig."
2041,2041,Goddamn.
2042,2042,"Right on, right on."
2043,2043,"All right, now, when are you boys gonna invite me down to Louisiana?"
2044,2044,We'd certainly love to have you.
2045,2045,Still a lot of work to be done.
2046,2046,"I mean, you've done a great job whipping up this chapter, but..."
2047,2047,"Well, I could do a great job on a national level."
2048,2048,Excuse me.
2049,2049,"Walter, may I?"
2050,2050,Behave yourself.
2051,2051,"Mr. Duke, I just want to say how honored my wife, Connie, and I are for being in your presence."
2052,2052,"What's your name, friend?"
2053,2053,Felix.
2054,2054,"Felix, the pleasure's all mine."
2055,2055,We'd love to have you out to the house for dinner sometime.
2056,2056,We Coloradans can cook just as good as those Cajun ladies you got down there.
2057,2057,"All right, now, Connie."
2058,2058,"We're on a very tight schedule here, but you made a mistake."
2059,2059,"Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?"
2060,2060,"Oh, I see Susie."
2061,2061,I'll be back in just a second.
2062,2062,Hey.
2063,2063,Thank you.
2064,2064,Thank you very much.
2065,2065, Is this your wife?
2066,2066, Yep.
2067,2067, Hey. Ron. How are you?
2068,2068, Hi.
2069,2069,Nice to meet you.
2070,2070,Never seen you dressed up before.
2071,2071,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Felix."
2072,2072, You have a fantastic night.
2073,2073," Oh, thank you."
2074,2074,America first.
2075,2075,"Hey, Ron, how you doing?"
2076,2076," I'm good, I'm good."
2077,2077, Good.
2078,2078, He's a cop.
2079,2079, Who?
2080,2080, That guy.
2081,2081, Ron?
2082,2082," No, the other guy."
2083,2083, Ron's a cop?
2084,2084,"His name is Phillip, but his nickname is Flip."
2085,2085, Who's Phillip?
2086,2086, Who's Ron? That's Phillip.
2087,2087, What the fuck are you talking about?
2088,2088, That guy.
2089,2089,That's the cop that sent me to the fucking big house for armed fucking robbery.
2090,2090,His fucking name is Phillip.
2091,2091,Phillip Zimmerman.
2092,2092, What's his name?
2093,2093, Phillip Zimmerman.
2094,2094,How many times I gotta fucking tell you?
2095,2095,Isn't that a fucking Jew name?
2096,2096,You can't go by that.
2097,2097,Jews change their name all the time to nonJew names.
2098,2098,"I mean, they killed Jesus, right?"
2099,2099,Ron Stallworth is a fucking Jew.
2100,2100,Could've been worse.
2101,2101,How so?
2102,2102,Could've been a nigger.
2103,2103,Yeah.
2104,2104,They built this stuff out of...
2105,2105,It starts to dissolve.
2106,2106,"It wasn't water, you know."
2107,2107,The beads take the...
2108,2108,He is a nigger.
2109,2109,Who?
2110,2110,That cop guarding Duke.
2111,2111,Zimmerman's using his name.
2112,2112,I guess I could use mops.
2113,2113, Shall we tell the grand wizard?
2114,2114," No, no, no. Not yet."
2115,2115,I'll find the moment.
2116,2116,Okay.
2117,2117,Fucking Jew.
2118,2118,"Yeah, I know. We have a strong future in America."
2119,2119,I'm so glad I made this trip.
2120,2120, With all these chapters...
2121,2121," Well, that's what we  have to work on."
2122,2122," Excuse me, gentlemen."
2123,2123,Hi.
2124,2124,"Mr. Duke, favor to ask."
2125,2125,Nobody's gonna believe me when I tell them that I was your personal bodyguard today.
2126,2126,Care to take a Polaroid with me?
2127,2127,I don't know.
2128,2128,Do those cool shades come off?
2129,2129,"Oh, yes, sir, they do."
2130,2130, Okay.
2131,2131, There we go.
2132,2132,"Hey, Jesse. Let's do this."
2133,2133,It'll be right.
2134,2134,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2135,2135, Who should...
2136,2136, What...
2137,2137, What's his name?
2138,2138," Uh, Ron."
2139,2139, Stallworth.
2140,2140," Ron. Ron, sir."
2141,2141,"Can you take this picture of us, please?"
2142,2142,"All right, don't touch me."
2143,2143,Great.
2144,2144, All right.
2145,2145, All right.
2146,2146,Thank you so much.
2147,2147,Thank you.
2148,2148,Here we go. One.
2149,2149,Two. Three.
2150,2150,Jesus H. Christ!
2151,2151,"What did you just do, boy?"
2152,2152,I mean...
2153,2153,What the hell did you just do?
2154,2154,"Sir, if you lay a finger on me, I'll arrest your ass for assaulting a police officer."
2155,2155,That's worth about five years in prison.
2156,2156,Try me.
2157,2157,See if I'm playing.
2158,2158,Why don't you come down to Louisiana sometime?
2159,2159,See how we play.
2160,2160,"Boy, you better get your nigger ass out of here now."
2161,2161,Mmmhmm.
2162,2162,America first.
2163,2163,Excuse me.
2164,2164,May I? Thanks.
2165,2165, You ready?
2166,2166," What, now?"
2167,2167,Don't be nervous.
2168,2168,Okay. I'm leaving.
2169,2169, Remember what we talked about.
2170,2170, Okay.
2171,2171,Come here.
2172,2172,Now you may do your job.
2173,2173, Okay.
2174,2174, Nice and easy does it.
2175,2175,Excuse me.
2176,2176,Excuse me.
2177,2177,"Attention, all units."
2178,2178,"Be on the lookout for a brown truck with a ""white pride"" bumper sticker."
2179,2179,"License plate, KE4108."
2180,2180,Kills this big rat in the back of our backyard.
2181,2181,And I actually start to like the fucking thing for the first time.
2182,2182,"I shit you not, three days later, this little Girl Scout comes to our door..."
2183,2183,Ron.
2184,2184,I believe you know my friend.
2185,2185,Who's your friend?
2186,2186,Hey.
2187,2187,"No, sorry, I don't think we've met before. Ron Stallworth."
2188,2188,"Yeah? It's been a few years, right?"
2189,2189, Been a few years?
2190,2190, Yeah.
2191,2191,"No, I'm sorry."
2192,2192,I don't think I can place you.
2193,2193, Did you two go to school together?
2194,2194, No. I went to private school.
2195,2195,"Leavenworth, Kansas."
2196,2196,Isn't that where the federal penitentiary is?
2197,2197,"Matter of fact, it is."
2198,2198,You know something about that.
2199,2199," Don't you, Flip?"
2200,2200, Flip?
2201,2201,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
2202,2202,There is an emergency phone call in the hallway for a Felix Kendrickson.
2203,2203,"I'll be right back, Flip."
2204,2204,Hello?
2205,2205,Felix.
2206,2206,"Jesus, they've got cops everywhere."
2207,2207,Somebody tipped them off.
2208,2208,"Oh, God, there's another one!"
2209,2209,"Calm down, baby."
2210,2210,"We planned for this, all right?"
2211,2211,"We'll go to plan B, okay?"
2212,2212,"Okay, okay, okay."
2213,2213,"Okay, okay, okay, plan B."
2214,2214,"All right, baby?"
2215,2215,You can do it.
2216,2216,I'll be right there.
2217,2217,All right.
2218,2218,"Remember when you said, one day, I'm gonna need your help?"
2219,2219,"This is it, baby."
2220,2220,"I love you, honey bun."
2221,2221,I love you.
2222,2222,I can make America great again.
2223,2223," Oh, yeah."
2224,2224," We need lawyers, we need doctors, and we need..."
2225,2225,"Excuse me, Mr. Duke."
2226,2226,Let's go.
2227,2227,Good talker.
2228,2228,He's a good talker.
2229,2229,"You'll have to excuse him, Mr. Duke. I apologize."
2230,2230,What was that all about?
2231,2231,Why'd he keep calling you Flip?
2232,2232,We were in prison together.
2233,2233,Years ago.
2234,2234,"Uh, it's an inside joke."
2235,2235,"Well, I certainly hope everything's okay."
2236,2236,"Yeah, but I think he may have violated his parole."
2237,2237,I just need to use the restroom real quick.
2238,2238,"Hey, where's Patrice?"
2239,2239,Patrice and Odetta took Mr. Turner back to his hotel.
2240,2240,Back up. Back up.
2241,2241,Freedom.
2242,2242,"It dares to expose the fact that not only is this a country, not a white racist country."
2243,2243,It is a racist country.
2244,2244,"Indeed, it is a racist country."
2245,2245,It's an antiwhite racist country.
2246,2246,Fuck.
2247,2247,But it's so important.
2248,2248,"Next time, we should work on getting a sister in here."
2249,2249,We need to be hearing their stories.
2250,2250, Yep.
2251,2251, We need to start doing this every week.
2252,2252,I'll reach out and see who I can get.
2253,2253,Yeah.
2254,2254,Colorado State Police.
2255,2255,Don't move.
2256,2256,"I said stop, damn it!"
2257,2257,No! Help me!
2258,2258,Help me!
2259,2259,"Help me! Help me, please!"
2260,2260,Stop. Stop.
2261,2261, Where'd you put the bomb?
2262,2262, No!
2263,2263,You're hurting me!
2264,2264,Where's the bomb?
2265,2265,Where'd you put it?
2266,2266, Get off me. Get off.
2267,2267, Where is it?
2268,2268, Get off of me!
2269,2269, Hold still. Stay still.
2270,2270, Stay still.
2271,2271, I don't know what you're talking about!
2272,2272, Where's the bomb?
2273,2273, Freeze!
2274,2274,"Get off her, or I'll fucking shoot you."
2275,2275, Whoa. Get off her.
2276,2276, Okay. All right.
2277,2277, Easy.
2278,2278, I'm undercover.
2279,2279, He's got a gun!
2280,2280, I'm a cop!
2281,2281, He touched me.
2282,2282, She's a terrorist.
2283,2283,That nigger attacked me.
2284,2284,He tried to rape me.
2285,2285,Arrest him.
2286,2286, I'm an undercover cop!
2287,2287, Show us your badge.
2288,2288," It's in my pocket, okay?"
2289,2289, What are you waiting for?
2290,2290, Show us your badge.
2291,2291, It's in my pocket. Relax.
2292,2292,That nigger attacked me.
2293,2293,He tried to rape me.
2294,2294, Arrest him. Arrest him!
2295,2295, I'm a cop.
2296,2296, What are you doing?
2297,2297, Get on the ground now!
2298,2298,Yeah! Hit him!
2299,2299,"When you think about the fact that America is still well over 85% white, that America was founded exclusively by white people who wrote a Declaration of Independence and who fought for our freedoms, were the basis of our civilization and our culture and our Western Christian society, that means that the Christian Church that grew up in the world was overwhelmingly a white, European phenomenon."
2300,2300,The magnificent beauty of the European people.
2301,2301,"But today, the word ""white"" is a curse word..."
2302,2302,Ron!
2303,2303,Antiwhite...
2304,2304,Patrice!
2305,2305,Patrice!
2306,2306,Hey! Hey!
2307,2307, Stand down. Stand down!
2308,2308, Who the fuck are you?
2309,2309,"Undercover cop, you fucking idiot."
2310,2310,The black guy's a cop?
2311,2311,Give me your keys.
2312,2312,"Oh, my God, Felix..."
2313,2313,You're late.
2314,2314, Felix!
2315,2315," Patrice, are you all right?"
2316,2316,Patrice.
2317,2317,Felix.
2318,2318,"Our own group, Ron and P."
2319,2319, Mmm. I don't know about that.
2320,2320, Go on tour.
2321,2321,"You know, they say two Afros that touch together, they're..."
2322,2322, It's good luck.
2323,2323, Who said that?
2324,2324,I read it somewhere.
2325,2325,"Tell me, where'd you get this?"
2326,2326, Saw this brother on Soul Train.
2327,2327, Mmmhmm.
2328,2328, Really?
2329,2329," And I just thought, I'mma take you there."
2330,2330, Gonna take you to California.
2331,2331, You don't know Don Cornelius.
2332,2332,That's my cousin on my mama's sister's side.
2333,2333, Really?
2334,2334," That's my cousin, yes."
2335,2335, So I got... I got access.
2336,2336, Yeah?
2337,2337, What is his cousin's name?
2338,2338," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
2339,2339,"Who is the soul sister, Ron?"
2340,2340,You been holding out on me.
2341,2341,"All right, take it easy."
2342,2342,Take it easy.
2343,2343,Oh...
2344,2344,"You don't remember me, do you?"
2345,2345,Uh...
2346,2346,Brother Kwame?
2347,2347,Stokely Carmichael?
2348,2348,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
2349,2349,"You looked good that night, but you look even better now."
2350,2350,How often do you do that to black people?
2351,2351,Do what?
2352,2352,Pull us over for nothing.
2353,2353,Harass us.
2354,2354,Put your hands all over a woman in the guise of searching her.
2355,2355,Call us everything but a child of God.
2356,2356,I don't know what you're talking about.
2357,2357,"Just like I told you, right, he's just taking advantage."
2358,2358,"In the end, talking loud, saying nothing."
2359,2359,Let me tell you both something.
2360,2360,I've been keeping you people in line in this city for years.
2361,2361,"What I did to your girl that night, I could do to any of you any time, any place."
2362,2362,That's my prerogative.
2363,2363,"I could even bust a cap in your black ass if I feel like it, and nothing will be done about it."
2364,2364,I wish the two of you'd been blown up instead of good white folks. Get it?
2365,2365,"Oh, I do get it."
2366,2366," Do you get it, Patrice?"
2367,2367, Mmm. Yeah.
2368,2368,I totally and completely get it.
2369,2369,"Jimmy, did you get it?"
2370,2370,"Oh, yes, I got it."
2371,2371,"Flip, did you get it?"
2372,2372," Oh, yeah, I got it."
2373,2373, Chief!
2374,2374, Do you get it?
2375,2375," Oh, I really, really get it."
2376,2376,You're under arrest.
2377,2377, What?
2378,2378, Get him out of here.
2379,2379, Get up. Police brutality.
2380,2380, Are you out of your minds?
2381,2381,Let's go.
2382,2382,"Police misconduct, sexual misconduct..."
2383,2383, Thank you very much.
2384,2384, Keep walking.
2385,2385, Tell it to the judge.
2386,2386, What about my rights?
2387,2387, Power to the people.
2388,2388, Power to the people.
2389,2389,The old hidden mic trick.
2390,2390,"Yes, it was all my work."
2391,2391,Hello.
2392,2392,To tape jobs.
2393,2393, Works every time.
2394,2394, Hidden mics.
2395,2395,"Good job, everybody."

2397,2397,Ronny!
2398,2398,Five. Four. Three.
2399,2399,Two. One.
2400,2400,Swish!
2401,2401, Look who the cat dragged in.
2402,2402," Thank you, thank you."
2403,2403,There he is!
2404,2404,The man of the minute.
2405,2405,"Don't you mean ""hour,"" Flip?"
2406,2406,"You slow, you blow."
2407,2407,"Ah, Jimmy."
2408,2408,"That Polaroid stunt you pulled, when you put your arms around them, I swear to God I almost shit myself."
2409,2409,"I told you, Ron was born ready."
2410,2410, Born ready is Ron.
2411,2411, There he is!
2412,2412,There's the crazy son of a bitch Come over here.
2413,2413,"You. You, you, you, you."
2414,2414, You did good.
2415,2415," Nah, we did good."
2416,2416,"Yeah, well, the Chief wants to see us in his office right now."
2417,2417," Let's go. Here, after you."
2418,2418," Let's go. No, after you."
2419,2419, Come on.
2420,2420, You're the man of the hour.
2421,2421,I cannot commend you enough for what you have achieved.
2422,2422,Do you realize there was not one cross burning the entire time you guys were involved?
2423,2423,"We're very aware, Chief."
2424,2424,But all good things have to come to an end.
2425,2425,What does that mean?
2426,2426, Budget cuts.
2427,2427, Budget cuts?
2428,2428,And when did this happen?
2429,2429,Last night?
2430,2430,"I wish I had a choice, but my hands are tied with this inflation."
2431,2431,"Besides, there no longer appears to be any credible threats."
2432,2432,Sounds like we did too good a job.
2433,2433,"Well, that's not a bad legacy to leave."
2434,2434,"And now, I need you, Ron Stallworth, to destroy all evidence of this investigation."
2435,2435, What?
2436,2436, We prefer that the public never knew about this investigation.
2437,2437,Uhhuh.
2438,2438,"Cease all further contact with the Ku Klux Klan, effective immediately."
2439,2439,"That goes for you, too, Flip."
2440,2440,This is total horseshit.
2441,2441,Fucking shenanigans.
2442,2442,"Aye, aye, Chief."
2443,2443,Subterfuge.
2444,2444, Skulduggery.
2445,2445," Hey, Ron."
2446,2446,Take a week off.
2447,2447,"Take your girlfriend, Patrice, on a vacation."
2448,2448,Live it up a little.
2449,2449,You worked hard.
2450,2450,"When you come back, we can discuss maybe a new assignment, Ron."
2451,2451,How about Narcotics?
2452,2452,"Mr. Duke, I'm so sorry we didn't get to spend more oneonone time together."
2453,2453,"Well, that was a..."
2454,2454,Just a tragedy.
2455,2455,I had just met those heroic brothers in the cause.
2456,2456,"""Heroic."" Yeah."
2457,2457,And the chapter is just shaken at the core.
2458,2458, Oh.
2459,2459, Yeah.
2460,2460,"And poor Connie, right?"
2461,2461,"I mean, not only does she lose her husband, but..."
2462,2462,Poor Connie.
2463,2463,She's looking at serious prison time.
2464,2464, Connie's going away.
2465,2465, We feel bad for Connie.
2466,2466,My God.
2467,2467,And then there was that nigger detective.
2468,2468,Basically...
2469,2469,Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
2470,2470,"Shut up, shut up."
2471,2471,Those goddamn coloreds.
2472,2472,They sure know how to spoil a celebration.
2473,2473,"Hey, you're getting me in trouble."
2474,2474,"Christ, you can say that again."
2475,2475,Those goddamn coloreds sure know how to spoil a celebration.
2476,2476,"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
2477,2477,Shoot.
2478,2478,"That nigger detective, did you ever..."
2479,2479,Did you ever get his name?
2480,2480,No. I don't think I...
2481,2481,Are you sure you don't know who he is?
2482,2482,Are you absolutely sure?
2483,2483,"'Cause that nigga, coon, gator bait, spade, spook, Sambo, spearchucking jungle bunny, Mississippi wind chime..."
2484,2484, Wind chime?
2485,2485, Detective...
2486,2486,"Is Ron Stallworth, you racist, peckerwood, redneck, inch worm, needledick motherfucker!"
2487,2487,Oh!
2488,2488,I'll be here all week.
2489,2489,What are you doing?
2490,2490,Nothing.
2491,2491,Finishing up.
2492,2492,Have you handed in your resignation from the KKK?
2493,2493,Affirmative.
2494,2494,Have you handed in your resignation from the Colorado Springs Police Department?
2495,2495,Negative.
2496,2496,"Truth be told, Patrice, I always wanted to be a cop, and I'm still for the liberation of my people."
2497,2497,My conscience won't let me sleep with the enemy.
2498,2498,Enemy?
2499,2499,"No, I'm the black man that saved your life."
2500,2500, You're absolutely right.
2501,2501, Right.
2502,2502,"And I thank you for it, but..."
2503,2503,I can't do this.
2504,2504,I think we should...
2505,2505,We should talk.
2506,2506,It's okay. It's okay.
2507,2507,I said it's...
2508,2508,Blood and soil!
2509,2509,Blood and soil!
2510,2510,Blood and soil!
2511,2511,Jews will not replace us!
2512,2512,Jews will not replace us!
2513,2513,Jews will not replace us!
2514,2514,White lives matter! White lives matter!
2515,2515,White lives matter!
2516,2516,Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
2517,2517,Black lives matter!
2518,2518,"What the fuck, man?"
2519,2519,"You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent."
2520,2520,"Nazis, go home!"
2521,2521,"Not all of those people were neoNazis, believe me."
2522,2522,Not all of those people were white supremacists.
2523,2523,You also had people that were very fine people.
2524,2524,"Because I believe that today in Charlottesville, this is a first step toward making a realization of something that Trump alluded to earlier in the campaign, which is..."
2525,2525,This is the first step toward taking America back.
2526,2526, Whose streets?
2527,2527, Our streets!
2528,2528, Whose streets?
2529,2529, Our streets!
2530,2530,Holy shit!
2531,2531,Holy shit!
2532,2532,I had to jump out of the way.
2533,2533,I almost got hit by the car my fucking self.
2534,2534,"There are people, bodies laying on the ground right now."
2535,2535,"Oh, my God!"
2536,2536,We got hit by a car!
2537,2537,"And there was a woman, uh, laying there, hardly breathing, and we ended up rolling her over, and she died."
2538,2538,This is my town! We did not want them motherfuckers here!
