13,13, What's up with this glum face? You seem so sad.

29,29,"It's just, it's not like Don."
30,30,I called over there earlier and he won't answer the phone.
31,31,I don't know what's going on.
32,32, Is he sick?
33,33, I don't know.

40,40,He's gotta be worried about her.
41,41,They have a lot going on.
42,42, So all of this mood has nothing to do with Allen?

44,44,I'm tired of worrying about him.
45,45,"I'm sure you are too, right?"
46,46," Yeah, well, I am, but he's your brother."
47,47,And I know that you worry about him.
48,48,"I mean, it was tough enough getting him out of New York."
49,49,Now he's all the way stuck in Los Angeles.
50,50, Look at you. Stuck.
51,51,I'm pretty sure Allen don't see it that way.

82,82,"You know, we miss you out here."
83,83," Oh, well, that's good to hear."
84,84,And I thought you'd be angry with me for not coming back.
85,85," Can't say I'm exactly happy about it, but you're a grown man, you make your own decisions."
86,86," Yeah, thanks for that."
87,87,"Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I'm considering coming back for Christmas."

99,99, Denise Oh. Now I am.
100,100, That sure was nice of the neighbors to take the kids ice skating.
101,101, Do you remember the time Billy Thomas took a snowball and threw it right at my face?
102,102,And you chased him around the neighborhood.
103,103, I never did catch that kid.
104,104,"Last time he ever threw a snowball at you, though."
105,105, Yeah.
106,106,I knew that's when you loved me.
107,107, What are you talking about? We were just children.
108,108, Yeah. But I knew.
109,109," So on that note, why don't we call it a night?"
110,110,Go home early and get warm.
111,111, That sounds like a wonderful plan.

118,118,"You know, I think you should go see Don tomorrow after work."
119,119,I think he'd be really happy to see you.
120,120, I highly doubt that.
121,121,He won't even return my phone calls.
122,122, Well then don't do it for him.
123,123,Do it for you.
124,124,You're gonna continue to worry about him.
125,125," Yeah, you're probably right."
126,126,I'm gonna go by tomorrow and talk to him.
127,127, Good.
128,128,"You remember, Don tomorrow."
129,129," Yes, ma'am."
130,130,gentle guitar music  George. What are you doing here?
131,131," Don, fact is, I'm a little bit worried about you."
132,132,"And a whole lot of other people at church worried about you, too."
133,133," Well, that's nice."
134,134,You tell 'em I'm fine.
135,135," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Don!"
136,136,You're gonna need to do better than that.
137,137,"Let me in for a minute, all right?"
138,138,"Don, please."
139,139, All right.
140,140,Just sit there until you're convinced I'm doing fine.
141,141, All right. Then I will.
142,142,"Come on, Don. What's going on with you?"
143,143,A couple weeks ago in church you seemed to be just fine.
144,144, I haven't been too good for a while.
145,145,I guess I'm good at hiding it.
146,146, Sorry to hear that. I didn't know.
147,147, It's not your fault.
148,148,Things have been building up.
149,149,Mary Anne dying and Celia and I estranged.
150,150,"Then Thanksgiving came along, and I just got down in the dumps I guess."
151,151, I had no idea that you and Celia were estranged.
152,152, I guess that's what you call it.
153,153,She hasn't spoken to me in over a year.
154,154,She won't return any of my phone calls.
155,155, Huh.
156,156,Do you have any idea why?
157,157, We had a fight.
158,158,She said some things.
159,159,Well.
160,160,I said some things she didn't appreciate.
161,161, Maybe you need to patch things up.
162,162, I don't think so.
163,163,"Friend of mine called me from Cincinnati, said he saw her in a horror movie."
164,164,He's a horror buff.
165,165,Said he didn't think I'd be too proud.
166,166,I could never bring myself to watch it.
167,167," Yeah, yeah."
168,168,Can't say as I blame you for that.
169,169," So you see, things haven't been too good for a while."
170,170," But Don, see, these are the moments when you should be leaning on God."
171,171,"I mean, lean on the church, lean on us."
172,172," If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon set it out for a while."
173,173," Well, I can't force you. That's for sure."
174,174,But I can pray for you.
175,175," Put in a good word for Celia, too."
176,176," Yeah. I will, Don."
177,177,I'll pray for both of you.
178,178, Hey.
179,179," Hi, hi. Hey, hey, hey."
180,180," All right, how's Don?"
181,181," Yeah, that's not good."
182,182,The man's pretty low. Depressed.
183,183," Yeah, when I'm low, I normally go to church."
184,184,The fellowship lifts my spirit.
185,185," Yeah, me too. That's what I was telling him."
186,186,"I think if we could just get him in church for a little while, get him out of his own head, I think we can help him get through this."
187,187," Yeah, I mean, with Mary Anne being gone and Celia being so far away."
188,188, I can't imagine what the man's going through right now.
189,189,"And I know he misses Mary Anne, but I think it is, I think he's worried about Celia."
190,190,I think that's what's weighing on him right now.
191,191, Okay.
192,192, Carly stole my socks.
193,193, They're mine!
194,194, I got this.
195,195, Okay. Hey.

205,205, George You remember Don Ford?
206,206," Yeah, sure."
207,207," Well, poor man, his wife passed away last year and he could really use some family support right about now."
208,208,"Celia, his only daughter, well, she's out there in Los Angeles, that's where you come in."
209,209, Okay. How?
210,210," Well, I mean, you've been considering making that trip back home."
211,211,I thought maybe you could reach out to Celia and see if she'd come back with you.
212,212,"You can make that crosscountry mission you keep talking about, and you'd both be home in time for Christmas."
213,213," Okay. Well, I'll do my best."
214,214,I was gonna tell you that I was gonna plan on coming home anyway for Christmas.
215,215,I can't make any promises that I can find Celia or even if she'd wanna come back.
216,216,"But either way, I'm coming back."
217,217, Good. I am glad to hear that.
218,218,And you know what? It may all work out just perfectly.

229,229,Think you can help me out?
230,230," Benjamin Yeah, you know, I'll look into it."
231,231," All right, cool."

291,291," Yeah, yeah. You mind if I sit?"

302,302," No, he just said he was doing some guy a favor."
303,303,Some guy from Kentucky wanted to meet me.
304,304,My manager is very shrewd.
305,305,He likes being owed favors by people who can help him.
306,306,"I don't know. He's not like a very great manager, so."
307,307, They usually aren't.
308,308, So what did you wanna talk about?
309,309," Well, George called me a few days ago, and an old friend of his isn't doing very well."
310,310,He thought having some family around for Christmas might help him out.
311,311,"Problem is, his only daughter lives in Los Angeles."
312,312,His name is Don Ford.
313,313, What?
314,314," Look, I apologize for not being straightforward from the beginning, I just thought if we met and we could talk a bit, then you might be  You thought that you could convince me into going back home with you?"
315,315,"I'm sorry, you honestly thought that you could talk me into flying back to Kentucky with you?"
316,316," I'm driving, actually."
317,317,Celia laughs  That's worse. I don't even know you.
318,318,Did he put you up to this?
319,319, No.
320,320,This was George's idea.
321,321,"Look, he's a good guy and he means well."
322,322,He wants to help people even if they don't want it.
323,323," Well, Allen, I am pretty darn sure that my dad does not want his help."
324,324,And I know that I don't want yours.
325,325,"Look, if you need to hear it from me straight, no."
326,326,I do not want to go back to Kentucky with you.
327,327, Here's my number.

329,329," Well, don't hold your breath."
330,330,Allen sighs gentle guitar music  The key's not gonna work.
331,331,You didn't pay rent for 2 1/2 months.
332,332, That's my hat.

344,344," If the offer still stands, I can go with you."
345,345," Yeah, of course."
346,346,So why the change of heart?
347,347," Um, my lease is up and I don't have any work scheduled till January."

457,457,How'd you end up in L.A.?
458,458, It's a long story.
459,459, We're driving across country.
460,460,How long could it take?
461,461," Well, I was failing spectacularly in New York."
462,462,Then my father died.
463,463,"And to get our inheritance, me and my brother had to take a crosscountry journey, retracing the steps our parents took on their honeymoon."
464,464," Okay. Kind of weird, but okay."
465,465, There's more to the story.
466,466,The plan was to thank folks that helped them after my father got his wallet stolen near Indio.
467,467,"When we finished the journey, me and my brother became brothers again, and I learned a few other things."
468,468," And when you got to Los Angeles, you stayed. For music."
469,469," Yeah, well, it wasn't the plan."
470,470, Plans. Yeah.
471,471,We all have plans.
472,472," Yeah, well, my plan was to go back to Lexington."
473,473,"But here it is almost a year later, and I'm going back for Christmas."
474,474,And I'll hopefully do a few good deeds on the way there.
475,475," So these good deeds, what are they?"
476,476," You know, if somebody's hungry, you feed 'em."
477,477,"Find somebody on the streets, you get 'em a room for the night."
478,478,That sort of thing.
479,479, Takes cash.
480,480, Cash I have.
481,481,I figured it would be better put to use to help people that don't have it.
482,482, Am I one of your good deeds?
483,483, You're one of George's good deeds.
484,484,Celia laughs I'm just here to give you a ride and stimulating conversation.

499,499,"So, what about Celia?"
500,500," Oh, well, after we spoke the other day, I called Allen in Los Angeles."
501,501,I asked if he could get in touch with her.
502,502,They got together a couple days ago and spoke.
503,503,"And get this, he's convinced her to drive home with him for the holidays."
504,504,Celia's gonna be here in time for Christmas.
505,505, She called you?
506,506," Oh, no, no, no, no."

548,548,"Sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other side, sometimes they go out completely."
549,549, We had an electrician look at it.
550,550,It seems that there were some mistakes made in the wiring when we had the sanctuary renovated.
551,551," Well, we have to do something."
552,552,Or we're gonna have the Christmas Eve concert performed in the dark.

778,778,"Yeah, well listen, there's something I need to tell you, and you're probably gonna wanna keep this to yourself for a while, but I told Don Ford you were bringing Celia home, and he got pretty upset at me."
779,779, Allen That is a problem.
780,780," George Oh, I know."
781,781, Allen So what's the plan?
782,782, Best plan I can come up with is put it in the Lord's hands.
783,783, Allen It's not a bad plan.
784,784," Goodnight, brother."
785,785,"Be safe, I'll see you soon."

819,819, Good day.
820,820,Gave her your coat?

822,822, Allen That was nice of you.
823,823,gentle guitar music  What?
824,824, That was just really cool of you.
825,825,Giving that woman your coat.
826,826, Somebody gave it to me.
827,827, Gave it to you?
828,828,I thought you said you bought it.
829,829, I said I got it.
830,830,I didn't say I bought it.
831,831,Allen? It's not obvious?
832,832,I don't have any money.
833,833,The lady at the clothing bank gave it to me.
834,834,gentle music And...
835,835,"My lease wasn't just up, either."
836,836,I was evicted.
837,837,I was on the street when I called you.
838,838,I just didn't have anywhere else to go.
839,839,"When I saw that young woman, I saw myself, and I just couldn't let her spend a cold night without a coat."

841,841," Hi, you're home for lunch. What a treat."
842,842, It's better than that.

844,844," Okay, well, I made some sandwiches for the kids."
845,845,Would you like one?
846,846," Yes, I would."
847,847,power tool buzzing  What is that?
848,848," That is, that's my dad."
849,849,He is making a small stable so we can have a nativity scene for our front lawn for Christmas next year.

852,852,"You know what, I'll thank him for it later."

855,855," George Bob, what are you doing?"

857,857,"What? Bob, listen."
858,858,"I don't mind you using my tools, I don't."
859,859,And I don't mind you using my garage. Go ahead.
860,860,But you've rearranged everything.
861,861,I'm never gonna be able to find anything.
862,862," Well, I'm just trying to square away the clutter, that's all, you leave this lying around."
863,863," But it's my clutter, Bob."
864,864,Like I know where everything's at out here.
865,865, How could you?
866,866," You know what, you do whatever you want to out here."
867,867,Have at it. I got bigger problems to deal with anyway.
868,868," Hey, George, George, whoa."
869,869,"What's wrong, you having problems with Denise or the kids or something?"
870,870,What's going on?
871,871," Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
872,872,"No, there's nothing to worry about. They're fine."
873,873,Thank the Lord for that.
874,874,It's just I've been...
875,875,You know what? You don't wanna hear about this.
876,876," Oh, come on, George."
877,877,What's going on?
878,878, All right.
879,879,"Well, it's this friend of mine."
880,880,He's been going through a pretty rough patch lately.
881,881, Hmm.
882,882," His wife, she passed away last year, and he and his daughter sometime after that had a big falling out of some sort, I don't know."
883,883,But she got angry and took off to Hollywood.
884,884,They've been estranged ever since.
885,885,"The holidays have come up, and it's just, ah, it's just really hitting him hard."
886,886,"And I thought, you know, what a great present it would be if I can reach out to her and get her to come back for the holidays, right?"
887,887,"Well, I did, and she's coming back."
888,888,She's gonna be here in time for Christmas.
889,889,So I go over to give them the good news.
890,890,The man got mad at me and he kicks me out of the house for doing this.
891,891," Well, maybe it's his mess and he wanted to take care of it himself."
892,892,Huh? Ever consider that?
893,893,"George chuckles  Okay. Yeah, maybe."
894,894," Well, maybe he's just angry because she did something for you that she wouldn't do for him."
895,895, What's that mean?
896,896," Well, maybe..."
897,897,They were estranged you say?
898,898, Right.
899,899, Right?
900,900,They're not talking.
901,901,"So much less her coming out here, and then you call her up and she comes here, she's here?"
902,902,Maybe it hurt his pride.
903,903," That doesn't make any sense, Bob."
904,904,"I mean, that's completely irrational."
905,905," Yeah, well."
906,906, Really.
907,907,You don't think she's gonna show up here and he's gonna turn her away at the door.
908,908," Well, I don't know him."
909,909,I don't know what they're like.
910,910,But I know like if it were Denise...
911,911,"sighs I never told you this, but when she was teenager, we had a big fight."
912,912,And she wouldn't speak to me for weeks.
913,913,"And I was just, at first I was angry."
914,914,"And then I wanted to forgive her and have her forgive me, but she just wouldn't talk to me."
915,915,And then one day I came home from work and she's sitting on the porch.
916,916,"And she comes down to the car and she puts her arms around my neck, just not a word, just hugs me."
917,917,One of the best days of my life.
918,918,"So, I don't know."
919,919,"It'll probably be a bumpy ride when they get here, but just have to pray that their love will see them through that."
920,920,Hmm?
921,921," Yes, sir."
922,922,Thank you.
923,923,I'll be praying for him.
924,924, Bob Yeah. You do that.
925,925,Bob chuckles gentle guitar music  There must be an electrician who can come over and fix this.
926,926, I've called everyone. It's just too close to Christmas.
927,927," Believers, nonbelievers, everyone takes this week off."
928,928, It's like a light show in there.
929,929,"It's brighter on one side, dimmer on the other."
930,930,And then they all just go out.
931,931, Is that dangerous?
932,932," No, honey. Well, I don't think so."
933,933, Wait a second. My brother.
934,934,He knows sort of an electrician. His name is Merle.
935,935, Sort of an electrician?
936,936,Isn't that like sort of being a NASCAR driver?
937,937," Yeah, Veronica, how sort of is he?"
938,938," Well, he wired his farmhouse out in Nicholasville."
939,939,I'm not sure how that turned out.
940,940, But is he licensed?
941,941, I think so.
942,942,"I mean, wouldn't he have to be?"
943,943," No, not necessarily."
944,944," Well, I think we better be sure."
945,945,Denise sighs  Ellen Get him over here.
946,946, Denise The sooner the better.
947,947,gentle guitar music  It's weird.
948,948,He didn't pick up.
949,949,I hope he's okay.
950,950, Yeah. I'm sure he's okay.
951,951,I have a confession to make.
952,952, What do you mean?
953,953," Well, since you told me about some difficult things about yourself, I thought I'd be honest with you."
954,954,I had promised to make this trip months ago.
955,955,I just didn't want to.
956,956,I wanted to stay in L.A. and play my music.
957,957, Why didn't you then?
958,958, I convinced myself that I could do that and serve the Lord.
959,959,"You know, write Christian songs and play my music."
960,960, That still sounds like a really good life.
961,961," Yeah, I guess so."
962,962,Then every Sunday I started just coming up with excuses not to go.
963,963,My songs became less about the Lord.
964,964,"Then my pastor called me and asked me to be part of the music program, and I came up with some lame excuse not to do it."
965,965, Is that when you realized you weren't serving the Lord?
966,966, My brother called me.
967,967,He wanted me to come home.
968,968,And then he told me about you and your dad.
969,969, But I said no. laughs  I know you did.
970,970,But somehow I knew you'd come around.
971,971,Celia laughs  So you did have faith.
972,972, Yeah. I did.
973,973,"gentle guitar music  So I've got the guest bed ready for Celia, and the sheets are downstairs on the couch for Allen."
974,974, Good.
975,975, Do you know when they're gonna get here?
976,976," Allen called from Mt. Vernon, Illinois, so I'm expecting they should be rolling in here in a couple hours."
977,977,I hope so.
978,978, All right.
979,979,"Well, then I'm gonna go to bed."
980,980," Okay, yeah. Go, go now."
981,981, Denise Okay.
982,982,"âª So I will believe âª âª And I will learn to love âª âª Because He first loved me âª âª I believe âª âª He is the Holy One, the only Son âª âª And what He's done, He's done in me âª âª He set me free âª âª With grace He gave to me âª  Allen This is it."

986,986, Hi!
987,987, You gonna invite us in or what? It's cold.

1016,1016," Yeah, no."
1017,1017," Well, Celia called him, but he didn't answer."
1018,1018,I didn't wanna say anything.
1019,1019," Well, you know what, maybe he was just asleep."
1020,1020,Just leave it up to the Lord. It'll be all right.
1021,1021, Allen Yeah.

1029,1029,They woke up and came downstairs.
1030,1030,Wanted to hang out with their Uncle Allen.
1031,1031,I think the guitar put 'em back to sleep.
1032,1032, I heard you playing when I came downstairs.
1033,1033, I'm just noodling around.
1034,1034, Is that what you call it?
1035,1035, It's a musical term.
1036,1036, Let's hear your song.

1185,1185,It's how he asked them.
1186,1186,Are you taking his side?

1208,1208," English, please?"
1209,1209, You need more power.
1210,1210,"Now, I fixed you up."
