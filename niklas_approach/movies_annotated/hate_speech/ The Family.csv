95,95,"you used to do anything, you know, for your roles."
96,96,"Those aren't stories I'm proud of, Freeman."
97,97,"They're just like stupid, stupid things that an actor does when they're too afraid to act."
98,98,I know better now.
99,99,That's too bad.

147,147, No. I might have a job.
148,148, Yeah? For me?
149,149, Nothing big. Just a story for a men's magazine.

195,195,"Baxter, can you do that, buddy?"
196,196, I shot you in the head.
197,197, Huh? Yeah.
198,198,What do you want me to say?
199,199, Doesn't matter.
200,200,Tell us anything.
201,201,Tell us about what you're writing.
202,202,"I am, uh..."
203,203,"I got a new book, but I'm a little writer's blocked."
204,204,"Oh, well, maybe we can help you out."
205,205,What's it called?
206,206,"It's called, uh..."
207,207,"""Children's Pit."" Well, what's it about?"
208,208,It's about these two kids...
209,209,"a brother and a sister, and they run away from an orphanage."
210,210,But they get caught by a pit master.
211,211," Well, what's that?"
212,212, It's just a guy who has an arena underground and forces them to fight for sport.
213,213,Do they escape?
214,214, I don't know. I don't know.
215,215,I haven't gotten that far.
216,216, Let me just take a little nap.
217,217," No, no, no!"
218,218,What's going on with my ear?
219,219,It really hurts.

221,221,You'll be fine in a few weeks.
222,222,"No flying for a while, though."
223,223,Did you say no flying?
224,224,That's what I said.
225,225,You'll feel better when your people get here.
226,226,chuckles  What does that mean?
227,227,I don't have any people.
228,228,"Well, we went through your wallet."
229,229,Standard procedure.
230,230,The doctor called your parents.
231,231,They're driving up to get you.

235,235,jazzy bass music Caleb and Camille Fang are most known for creating improvised public events that incorporate their own children into the artwork.
236,236,The results are often as unsettling as they are arresting.
237,237,"In one of their earliest works, Caleb Fang walked through a crowded roller skating rink carrying his infant daughter."
238,238,"Suddenly, a series of homemade flarelike devices he had taped to his back began to discharge."
239,239,Camille captured the event from the rink's second level.
240,240,"The Fangs simply throw themselves into a space as if they were hand grenades, and wait for the disruption to occur."
241,241, Candace Cane!
242,242,Give it up!
243,243,audience cheers and applauds  Whoo!
244,244,They seemed to have no expectations other than to willfully cause unrest.
245,245,"inaudible audience gasping This kind of event is so rudimentary, so unencumbered by the traditions that have come before it, that it almost strains the notion of what constitutes art."
246,246, The Fangs.
247,247,That's just a gimmick.
248,248, That's all that is.
249,249, laughs You can... that's not fair.
250,250,"I mean, you know, whether or not you like the Fangs' work, you can't deny the artistry, certainly."
251,251, What? Of course I can.
252,252,That's my job.
253,253,"Look, the Fangs pass off these hollow pranks as if that's enough."
254,254,"You can say the same thing about the diggers, or the situationists, or the Dadaists for that matter."
255,255,"But if you care to look a little deeper, you'll find that the Fangs transcend what..."
256,256,They're not transcending anything.
257,257, It's just tricks.
258,258, If...
259,259,"in the... in the pageant piece, they challenged gender stereotypes."
260,260,"In the restaurant piece, they ask us to look at food not as sustenance, but as status or style."
261,261, In some of the early...
262,262," Oh, come on!"
263,263,"Just because... just because you attach a statement doesn't make it art, you know?"
264,264,You can call it art but real art requires an aesthetic intelligence.
265,265, But that ambiguity is what makes it interesting.
266,266,Is it art or is it a joke?
267,267,Is it profound or is it a prank?
268,268,Are they geniuses or charlatans?
269,269,These are the questions that they want us to ask.
270,270,"Well, they're not too hard to answer."
271,271,And the Fangs are challenging the very nature of art itself.
272,272,I don't think they are.
273,273,"They embrace everything that's wonderful about art, and they subvert it at the same time."
274,274,They are deeply serious class clowns who celebrate...
275,275,"""Clowns"" is right, yeah."
276,276,I'm sorry.
277,277,What were you saying?
278,278,I... I think what they're doing is wonderful.
279,279,"Well, I guess... I guess I just don't get it."
280,280,"Well, that's pretty obvious."
281,281,So the truth is making a movie is really...
282,282,"it's a strange process, you know?"
283,283,Always requires some sort of degree of weirdness.
284,284,Is that why you took off your top?
285,285,I took off my top because...
286,286,"well, because I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it."
287,287,"I've never done a nude scene before, so what the hell, right?"
288,288,laughs Did Sally tell you that this was...
289,289,sighs This is a very important article for me.
290,290," No, she didn't. I know."
291,291,Yeah.
292,292,They say I'm in a bit of a...
293,293,I don't know.
294,294,"Precarious position right now careerwise, and then I have to, I don't know..."
295,295,but I'm not stable.
296,296,You don't have to worry about that.
297,297," whispering Thank you, but I do."
298,298,Obviously I do.
299,299,"Well, you can relax, because I don't care about your meltdowns."
300,300,I'm actually more interested in your family.
301,301,glass shatters It's okay.
302,302,I'm sorry.
303,303,I'm so sorry.
304,304, I'll get you another.
305,305, Thank you very much.
306,306, sighs Um...
307,307,"you're not going to put that in the article, I hope."
308,308, How could I leave it out?
309,309," Oh, shit."
310,310,Are you always so jumpy when someone mentions your parents?
311,311,"It doesn't come up often, actually."
312,312, Really?
313,313,But they're famous.
314,314,"Well, not really."
315,315,"In certain circles, I suppose."
316,316,But...
317,317,I wrote my thesis on their work.
318,318,You're kidding.
319,319,Wow.
320,320,Great.
321,321,That's why I wanted to do this story.
322,322,Huh.
323,323,Do you think you'll ever do another piece with them?
324,324,No.
325,325,God no.
326,326,laughs Thanks.
327,327,"It must have been fun, though."
328,328,Come on.
329,329,Being child A?
330,330," Yeah, of course."
331,331,But I'm not a child anymore.
332,332,"Anyway, your readers don't want to hear about this."
333,333,They don't want to hear about weirdo performance art.
334,334,"Look, I think you're a great actress."
335,335,"But the artist you are, don't you think she was already there in child A?"
336,336,The emotion? The joy?
337,337,The anarchy?
338,338,It's too bad none of your directors have known how to channel all that the way your parents did.
339,339,When I was 9 years old...
340,340,child A was a role.
341,341,It was a role I played.
342,342,It's not who I am.
343,343,"Hey, Baxter."
344,344,"How are you doing, buddy?"
345,345,I'm terrible.
346,346,Where are you?
347,347,I'm in upstate New York.
348,348,"Mmm, yeah, that is terrible."
349,349,What are you doing up there?
350,350,I got shot in the head.
351,351,What did you say?
352,352, I got shot in the head.
353,353,But I'm okay.
354,354,I'm...
355,355,"well, I'm not okay."
356,356,I'm in a hospital.
357,357,"But, you know, I'm not dying, so..."
358,358,You got shot in the head?
359,359,I did.
360,360," Well, who?"
361,361,Who shot you in the head?
362,362, Just this guy.
363,363,And it was a potato.
364,364,Baxter...
365,365,"It's not why I'm calling, though."
366,366," Come on, are you on drugs?"
367,367,Are you?
368,368,"Yeah. Percocet, mostly."
369,369, Mmhmm. Would you call me back when you're lucid?
370,370," No, no, Annie."
371,371,Don't hang up.
372,372," Come on, Baxter..."
373,373, The doctors will not let me leave.
374,374,And Mom and Dad are bringing me home to recuperate.
375,375, What?
376,376, Yeah.
377,377,Mom and Dad are on their way.
378,378,You got to come get me.
379,379,"Look, I'm in my pajamas and I'm 3,000 miles away."
380,380, I can't do that.
381,381," Well, I can't go back home."
382,382,I can't go back home by myself.
383,383,All right. Um...
384,384,"I'm going to help you out, but I'm just... I need a day to sort a few things out."
385,385,I'm in a really weird place right now.
386,386,"Are you in a weird place, Annie?"
387,387,I almost got killed by a potato.
388,388, Would you just relax?
389,389,I'm sending you a plane ticket.
390,390,You can come and stay with me.
391,391,"No, no, I can't fly, Annie."
392,392,So tell them you can't go.
393,393,"Just stand up to them, Baxter."
394,394,When have I ever done that?
395,395,"No answer, right?"
396,396,Because I've never done it.
397,397,"Thanks a lot, Annie."
398,398,"The point is, I call in a favor."
399,399,"I line up this guy from ""Esquire."" And you decide to nail him?"
400,400," No, I didn't decide it."
401,401,Just... it happened.
402,402,"That's the problem, Annie."
403,403,These things shouldn't just happened.
404,404, I know.
405,405," You could get away with this a few years ago, okay?"
406,406,Everybody likes a little shoplifting with their starlet.
407,407,A little DUI here and again.
408,408,It's kind of cute.
409,409," Come on, I stopped that."
410,410,Done.
411,411,"Yes, there was a nice lull in the middle years, you know?"
412,412,Nice and quiet.
413,413,But things are starting to get a little loopy again.
414,414,You know? And I know the good offers aren't coming in.
415,415,But you can't panic about it.
416,416,I can get back on track.
417,417,"I can, Sally."
418,418,I don't think you can.
419,419,"You know, you have the impulse control of a 2yearold."
420,420,Look...
421,421,Were you drinking again?
422,422,No.
423,423,"Listen, if you are, I know a couple places."
424,424,I'm not drinking.
425,425,I just... I need a project.
426,426,"I mean, what about the start date on ""Powers the Bee 3""?"
427,427,Have we got that yet?
428,428,You're going to have to talk to Gordon about that.
429,429,Why?
430,430, Why? Because he's your agent.
431,431,I think you should hear it from him.
432,432, Hear what?
433,433," Oh, God."
434,434,What?
435,435,"They offered ""Lady Lightning"" to Alison Cane."
436,436, Okay.
437,437, Mmhmm.
438,438,"Well, that's a bummer."
439,439," Come on, Annie."
440,440,Look at this as a good thing.
441,441,You don't have to wear that ridiculous costume anymore.
442,442,I love that costume.
443,443, Ugh!
444,444,We'll get you a better one.
445,445,"In the meantime, I think you need to take a step back."
446,446,I think you just have to have a real sitdown with yourself.
447,447,I don't even know what that means.
448,448,"âª Bad world âª âª It's unforgiving âª âª Kill all parents so you can keep living âª âª Kill all parents âª âª So you can keep living âª âª Kill them, kill them, kill them dead âª applause Thank you. Thank you."

462,462,You guys are awful.
463,463,She knows what she's talking about.
464,464,"You should learn how to play your instruments, not just hold them and pound them."
465,465,We can't afford lessons.
466,466," Oh, I'm sorry."
467,467,Did I hurt your feelings?
468,468,"Because I want to kill myself, it's that bad."
469,469,You're probably killing your dog with your music.
470,470,This will be great for my documentary on crap.
471,471," All right, keep playing, kids."
472,472,Keep playing.
473,473, Do not listen to them.
474,474," What, you like this?"

477,477,I hope you don't have any kids.
478,478,I hope your uterus shriveled up!

489,489, Awful!
490,490, Awful!
491,491, I have never heard...
492,492, Camera and the footage all destroyed.
493,493,But I don't care!
494,494,I don't care.
495,495,That was just for us.

503,503,Thank you for coming.
504,504,"Well, we're going to take care of you."
505,505,Yeah. You need taking care of too?
506,506, Yeah.
507,507, You okay?
508,508,How's your ear?
509,509,It's... it's better than it was yesterday.
510,510," Oh, God."
511,511, Look at these two.
512,512, Hey.
513,513, Welcome home.
514,514, Look at how skinny you are.
515,515, What's with the bandages?
516,516,"Well, did you see your brother's ear?"
517,517,We wanted to play along.
518,518,"Oh, you look so beautiful."
519,519, We brought you a neck brace.
520,520,Look at this.
521,521," Oh, oh, here."
522,522, Come on.
523,523, I'm not putting that on.
524,524, Brandnew. Never been used.
525,525,"âª âª So, hey, what's the plan?"
526,526,Daddy.
527,527," Sorry, Annie."
528,528,"What's the plan, Annie?"
529,529, I don't know.
530,530,I'm just here for Baxter.
531,531,"Oh, we're all here for Baxter."
532,532, Whatever Baxter needs.
533,533, This is a place of healing.
534,534, Mmhmm.
535,535, That's great.
536,536,I just need someone to take me shopping.
537,537,"Not a lot of great options in your closet, Dad."
538,538,"Go lighter on those pills, sweetheart."
539,539,"My ear hurts pretty bad, Mom."
540,540,What about you?
541,541,Anything you're itching to do while you're back?
542,542,"Mm, I'm just going to take it easy."
543,543,Do a little yoga.
544,544,Some reflection.
545,545," Ooh, reflection."
546,546, Yeah.
547,547,Apparently I have some bad habits that I have to break.
548,548,Don't do that.
549,549,Your bad habits are my favorite thing about you.
550,550,"Yeah, but I think that's part of the problem, Daddy."
551,551,"Hey, speaking of, we saw your titty shots."
552,552, Holy shit.
553,553, They were wonderful.
554,554, sighs  Jesus Christ.
555,555,"Hey, it's about time you started playing with the idea of celebrity in the female form as viewed objects."
556,556,That's not what I was doing.
557,557,"Of course it is, whether you know it or not."
558,558,"You could take the girl out of the art, but you cannot take the art out of the girl."
559,559,Well...
560,560,"I'm still an artist, Daddy."
561,561,That's what I just said.
562,562," Yeah, actors."
563,563,Actors are artists.
564,564, Yes. Didn't I say I like your titty shot?
565,565,We both liked them very much.
566,566,"You have beautiful breasts, sweetheart."
567,567,"bangs table  Okay, that's it!"
568,568,"Can we not talk about the titty shots anymore, please?"
569,569,"And we can stop saying titty shots, everybody."
570,570,To Fangs.
571,571,Together again.
572,572,That's how it should be.
573,573,Waited a long time for this.
574,574,Cheers.
575,575,Titty shots.
576,576,Titty.
577,577, Titty.
578,578, Dad.
579,579, Titty!
580,580," Ugh, Dad..."
581,581, laughs  Ridiculous.
582,582,inaudible sighs I was better back then.
583,583,sighs  It was so simple.
584,584, Yeah.
585,585,They just told us what to do.
586,586,sighs When did it get so complicated?
587,587,Don't you know?
588,588,No.
589,589, Smother Beach.
590,590,Come here.
591,591,Smother Beach.
592,592,Baxter...
593,593,You never sold the urgency in this one.
594,594,Thank God your sister improvised a bit.
595,595,Your mother nearly died out there.
596,596,Baxter was perfect.
597,597,Perfect.
598,598,What do you got on?
599,599,Mind your business.
600,600,I'll make popcorn!
601,601,Thank you.
602,602,"Got something going on upstairs, huh?"
603,603,"Well, we can pick it up later."
604,604,Nobody told me it was movie night.
605,605,Put another one on just for the hell of it.
606,606,"Oh, that's better."
607,607,Why are we doing this?
608,608,Because need to behave like healthy people.
609,609,It's called acting.
610,610,"You know? You want to look, you act the part before you know you are that person."
611,611,panting  What person?
612,612,That person who doesn't screw things up.
613,613,Which means no more Percocet for you.
614,614,No more booze for me.
615,615,"Yeah, you think you can do that?"
616,616,"Oh, yeah."
617,617,I thought it was nice last night.
618,618,Looking at those old pieces sitting on the couch together.
619,619,What?
620,620,"You don't see it, do you?"
621,621,See what?
622,622,"Being seduced by your own parents, which I think is kind of gross."
623,623,"Come on, you're ridiculous."
624,624,Let's turn back.
625,625,Mom wants us to run some errands with her.
626,626,"You think I'm being ridiculous, huh?"
627,627, Yeah.
628,628, You didn't see that?
629,629,You didn't pick up on any of that?
630,630, No.
631,631, Come on.
632,632,What kind of errands?
633,633,I want to do some yoga after this.
634,634, Let's go.
635,635,Let's run uphill.
636,636,"You want to be that person, that person runs uphill."
637,637, panting  Come on.
638,638,"Yeah, I'll..."
639,639,I'll run uphill.
640,640, Uhoh.
641,641, Come on!
642,642,Ow.
643,643,"Mmm, so where are we going?"
644,644,To the amusement park.
645,645,We're running an errand at the amusement park?
646,646,Why are we going there?
647,647,The Denver MCA wants me to create a new piece.
648,648,"I haven't heard from them in years, and when we realized that you'd both be home..."
649,649,"Needless to say, they were very excited."
650,650, We're doing a piece?
651,651," Annie, Annie, put this on."
652,652, Oh.
653,653, What did I tell you?
654,654,What is this?
655,655,"It's a shirt, honey."
656,656,"And you need to wear it, or the event won't work."
657,657,"All you have to do is hand out these fake coupons, huh?"
658,658, Yeah.
659,659, For chicken sandwiches.
660,660,"And when we're doing that, Baxter will film all the people at the counter demanding free food."
661,661,"Then I rally the angry customers, I get them to storm the counters."
662,662,It'll be a thing of beauty.
663,663,I don't think this is a good idea.
664,664, It's not a good idea.
665,665, No.
666,666,What are you talking about?
667,667,"It's going to be fun, like old times."
668,668,You're going to be brilliant.
669,669,"Yeah, what about when they recognize Annie?"
670,670,We brought a disguise.
671,671,Annie's going to wear a disguise?
672,672, That's a good one. I can't.
673,673," That stinks, Mom."
674,674, Baxter.
675,675, Yeah?
676,676, Stay out of this.
677,677, Okay.
678,678,"If the tabloids get a hold of this, it will be terrible for me."
679,679, Exactly right.
680,680,Who cares? You shouldn't be in that business anyway.
681,681, What?
682,682, Please don't say that.
683,683,"Well, you've been at it for 20 years."
684,684,What have you got to show for it?
685,685,A bunch of crap movies and a tampon commercial.
686,686," Caleb, be nice."
687,687," Oh, my God, Dad."
688,688, Was it not a tampon campaign?
689,689, It was.
690,690,Absorb all the good things in life and leave the rest to us.
691,691," Okay, come on."
692,692, That's a terrible tag line.
693,693, Just trying to make a living.
694,694, I'm giving you an opportunity  to be artists again.
695,695," Okay, we've been over this."
696,696,A and B are still artists.
697,697,"Please don't call us A and B, Mom."
698,698,"""Please don't call us artists,"" you mean."
699,699, Caleb!
700,700," I'm sorry, your popcorn flicks and Baxter's emo crap fiction is not art."
701,701,It's garbage.
702,702,What is wrong with him?
703,703,Dad?
704,704,"Caleb, can I just say you forget, I've seen the reviews of the masterpieces you and Mom have been churning out."
705,705," Don't, don't, don't, don't."
706,706," No, this..."
707,707,He needs to hear this.
708,708," No, no. Annie, drop it."
709,709, All right? Let's talk about the water balloon thing. Huh?
710,710, Yeah.
711,711, Let's talk about the disastrous wifeabusive piece.
712,712,What about the epileptic and the...
713,713," Oh, my God. The epileptic in the antique shop."
714,714," That was distasteful, Mom."
715,715," Okay, all right, we get it."
716,716,"We get it, the pieces aren't the same without you."
717,717, We know that.
718,718, They're not.
719,719," Oh, no, they're not."
720,720, No.
721,721, That's why we're doing this.
722,722, Shove it!
723,723,Shove it up your ass!
724,724,We don't need you.
725,725,"Your mother and I, we'll do it ourselves."
726,726,We've done it that way for years.
727,727,We're trying to be nice.
728,728,Thought you might want to feel part of it again.
729,729,But to hell with you both.
730,730,"Baxter, could you at least work the camera?"
731,731,But you still want me to film it?
732,732," Yes, of course."
733,733," Yeah, grudgingly."
734,734,"Yeah, you're damn right it's going to be grudgingly."
735,735, Yeah. Go ahead.
736,736, No.
737,737,Even though it's all been shoved up my ass.
738,738,No...
739,739,This is horrible.
740,740,It's really tough to watch.
741,741,"I mean, I knew he didn't like my movies, but I had no idea that he hated them."
742,742,What he hates is that he needs us.
743,743,"Without us, their work sucks."
744,744,That's what he hates.
745,745,I'm sorry to bother you.
746,746,"Oh, it's fine."
747,747, Would you like me to sign...
748,748, Baxter?
749,749,Suzanne. Suzanne Crosby?
750,750," Oh, yeah. You left a message."
751,751,How's it going?
752,752,We went to high school together.
753,753, Yeah. It's okay if you don't remember me.
754,754,"No, I do, I do, now that I'm looking at you."
755,755, Your hair used to be...
756,756," Oh, God, yeah."
757,757,"And you had a bunch of piercings, am I right?"
758,758," Yeah, yeah."
759,759,I still do have a couple.
760,760," Oh, yeah."
761,761,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
762,762,I hope this isn't too weird.
763,763,"You know, I just... I saw you, happened to be here."
764,764,So I just thought I'd say hello.
765,765,She's got a writing class she wants me to come to.
766,766,"Well, you heard."
767,767,"This is my sister, Annie."
768,768, Hi. I don't mean to be pushy.
769,769, You're not.
770,770," I just think the students would love to hear you speak, you being from the area and making such a name for yourself."
771,771,"Oh, I don't know about that."
772,772," Oh, come on."
773,773, Yeah.
774,774, Say yes.
775,775, Yeah!
776,776, Say yes.
777,777, I'm thinking about it.
778,778, Let me...
779,779, Come on.
780,780,"Well, you know, no pressure."
781,781,"I'm easy, so just..."
782,782,you have the information.
783,783,"Yeah, I'll get a hold of you."
784,784,I'll...
785,785,it was good to see you.
786,786, Okay. Thanks.
787,787, Good to see you.
788,788, Good to see you too.
789,789, Bye.
790,790,She's adorable.
791,791,Yeah.
792,792,"Oh, look alive."
793,793,They hooked one.
794,794,inaudible That poor cashier.
795,795,She doesn't get paid enough to handle this.
796,796,"Oh, shit."
797,797,He's giving it to him.
798,798, What is that?
799,799,She's giving him a sandwich.
800,800, She thinks it's real?
801,801, I don't know.
802,802,She thinks it's real.
803,803,"Okay, see what happens."
804,804,She gave it to them.
805,805,What the hell?
806,806,What the hell is going on here?
807,807,You can't rely on anybody these days to make a proper piece of art.
808,808,Give me one of those.
809,809,Hello.
810,810,Hi.
811,811," I'd like one free sandwich, please."
812,812,Sure thing.
813,813,Here you go.
814,814, Thank you.
815,815,"Wait, don't I need a coupon?"
816,816,Okay.
817,817,"Now, I got this from some shadylooking characters over by the Orange Julius."
818,818,It doesn't seem on the up and up.
819,819," chuckles No, it's good."
820,820,I think that's fake.
821,821,I don't think so.
822,822,"It is, though."
823,823,I want you to look at it for two seconds; you tell me if that's real.
824,824,Do you want the sandwich or not?
825,825,Let me talk to your manager.
826,826,Sure.
827,827,"Charlie, can you come over here for a second?"
828,828, Hi. What can I do for you?
829,829,Is the manager not at work today?
830,830," Oh, no, he is."
831,831,You got him.
832,832,That coupon is fake.
833,833, Oh.
834,834,"No, it's fine, sir."
835,835,Have you looked at it?
836,836, I did. It's official.
837,837,It's not official.
838,838,It does not look to be official to me.
839,839,That's a fake.
840,840,And you've handed out all these free sandwiches for counterfeit coupons?
841,841,"You're a fool, and your people are fools."
842,842,"Sir, please just take your free sandwich and step out of line."
843,843,I wouldn't eat that shit sandwich if you paid me.
844,844,"Okay, sir, I will call the police."
845,845,You have the tiniest responsibility.
846,846,You just have to do your job.
847,847,I do the rest.
848,848,All you have to do is let that thing happen.
849,849,What is wrong with people these days?
850,850,"I do the work, you get to witness the beauty."
851,851,That's all you had to...
852,852,stop that!
853,853,You don't record me.
854,854,I record you.
855,855,This is supposed to be art.

857,857,"Honey, let's just leave."
858,858,Didn't I say this would happen?
859,859,You thought they'd solve everything.
860,860,They've only made things worse.
861,861, You did this. Hey!
862,862,Hey!
863,863,You! You did this!
864,864,"Okay, honey, let's go."
865,865,dramatic music I think they're losing it.
866,866,Their artistic sensibility?
867,867," No, their minds. They're..."

869,869,"I mean, he's always had an odd idea of what constituted art."
870,870,"But come on, that was almost silly."
871,871,Did he really think he could lead a coup on a Chicken Queen?
872,872,I don't know.
873,873,sighs Maybe we should have helped them.
874,874, Help them?
875,875, Yeah.
876,876,"No, Annie, come on."
877,877,Absolutely not.
878,878,They're struggling.
879,879,We all are.
880,880,"Well, it's not the same, though."
881,881,"Besides, helping them wouldn't solve anything."
882,882,It would turn us back into kids.
883,883,Is that what you want?
884,884,Hey.
885,885,Your father and I have decided to go to the Berkshires for a few days.
886,886," Berkshires, huh? Great."
887,887, When?
888,888, Tonight.
889,889,Is this because of the Chicken Queen?
890,890,What a disaster.
891,891,"Great art's always difficult, though, right?"
892,892,What'd you say?
893,893,I just said what you always tell us.
894,894,That great art's always difficult.
895,895,Do me a favor.
896,896,Don't talk about things you know nothing about.
897,897, Okay. Deal.
898,898,I found something weird.
899,899,That is weird.
900,900,There's like a hundred of these in the back of my closet.
901,901,What do you think they are?
902,902,I don't know.
903,903,Maybe a fan sent them?
904,904,"I mean, remember that lady who sent all those teeth in the Ziploc bags?"
905,905,They're actually kind of great.
906,906,"I mean, look at the detail."
907,907, Yeah.
908,908, What are you doing?
909,909, Nothing.

915,915,God damn it.
916,916,Where did these paintings come from?
917,917,They're mine.
918,918, They're yours?
919,919, You did these?
920,920,"Yes, I did."
921,921,"Since when did you start painting, Mom?"
922,922,How do you think I got into art school?
923,923,I stopped when I met Daddy.
924,924,So he doesn't know about these?
925,925,"Oh, good God, no."

936,936,So let's...
937,937,let's put these back.
938,938,They're amazing.
939,939,"Oh, they're just paintings."
940,940,"They're pretty great, Mom."
941,941,"Yeah, thank you."
942,942,"The fridge is full, so you are welcome to whatever is in there."

959,959," Oh, yeah?"

961,961,I was thinking about what...
962,962,"what that stupid ""Esquire"" guy said."
963,963,That every time I make a...
964,964,"I don't know, make a mess of things, I'm just doing exactly what child A always did."
965,965,"But when I think about, it pissed me off that he was..."
966,966,"That he was right on the money, right?"
967,967,"Exactly, Baxter."
968,968,He was right on the money.
969,969,And yesterday I didn't do that.
970,970,"Mmmm, child A stood up to them."
971,971,"And that's thanks to child B, right?"
972,972,Yeah.
973,973,We're helping each other.
974,974,We're breaking old patterns.

981,981, My ear hurt.
982,982,"Anyway, but something's working."
983,983, You know?
984,984, Mmhmm.
985,985,"And when Mom and Dad realize that we're not kids anymore, which they have to do, we could have a healthy family."

994,994,"Good morning, ma'am."
995,995,Would you mind coming down to the station?
996,996,There's a situation we'd like to talk to you about.
997,997,"Now, the car that is registered to your parents was found at a rest stop on route 22 just before the Massachusetts border."
998,998,"They were not with the car, but there were, I'm afraid, signs of a struggle, and quite a bit of blood."
999,999,We checked the security cameras and interviewed employees at the surrounding locations.
1000,1000,But we've been unable to come up with anything conclusive at this point.
1001,1001,"All signs indicate that your parents are currently missing, and we have to suspect foul play."
1002,1002,"I'm sorry, sheriff."
1003,1003,This is... our parents aren't missing.
1004,1004,They're artists.
1005,1005,It's all a performance.
1006,1006,We know all about their art things.
1007,1007,"But the fact is, they're missing from a car that they were driving, and it's covered in blood."
1008,1008, sighs This is so stupid.
1009,1009,"Ma'am, there have been four rest stop abductions in the last nine months, all along route 22, and all ending in homicides."
1010,1010,Hang on.
1011,1011,Really?
1012,1012,That's not what this is.
1013,1013,"Well, let's hope not."
1014,1014, Let's hope not.
1015,1015,But the crime scene photos do show some startling similarities to the other cases.
1016,1016,Would it be possible for me to have a look at that?
1017,1017,Did you say four in the last nine months?
1018,1018,And this would be the fifth or the fourth?
1019,1019, scoffs  Jesus Christ.
1020,1020,Let me see that.
1021,1021, It's fake. Fake blood.
1022,1022,This is what they...
1023,1023, Can I see it?
1024,1024, This is what they use in a lot of their performances.
1025,1025,The lab will let us know if that is the case.

1027,1027,"We don't know that, but..."

1030,1030,"And as soon as you say they're dead, they're going to pop up resurrected."

1036,1036,And do you know why they did it?
1037,1037,Because we wouldn't do the Chicken Queen thing.

1050,1050,She didn't want to go.
1051,1051,Why else would she leave those paintings for us to find?
1052,1052," Well, she didn't."
1053,1053,He hid them.
1054,1054, From him.
1055,1055,She wasn't hiding them from us.
1056,1056,They were in my closet.
1057,1057,She wants us to know that she's her own artist.
1058,1058,Right?
1059,1059,She doesn't want to do his art anymore.
1060,1060,Same as us. She is...
1061,1061,"she is being forced into it, just as we are."
1062,1062,We're all being forced into this crap.
1063,1063,sighs And what if he isn't doing that?
1064,1064,What if this is real?
1065,1065,"I mean, just consider it."
1066,1066,"Baxter, come on."
1067,1067," It could be real, Annie."
1068,1068,Come on.
1069,1069,That's what he wants.
1070,1070,This is what he wants.
1071,1071,He wants us to think that they're dead.
1072,1072,"It's pretty low, even by his standards, but that's what he wants."
1073,1073,"He wants child A, child B crying, doing this."

1091,1091,We're putting our heads together and we're going to search for them.

1093,1093,dramatic music âª âª I can't think of anyone.
1094,1094,They didn't have any friends.
1095,1095,We're their only relatives.

1104,1104,Don't you think we should let the sheriff do all this?
1105,1105," No, no. The sheriff isn't looking for them."
1106,1106,The sheriff is looking for murderers.
1107,1107,"Yeah, and if we do find them and they're alive, what then?"
1108,1108,What do we do?
1109,1109,Do we punish them?
1110,1110,"This isn't about punishment, Baxter."
1111,1111,This is about honesty.
1112,1112,"This is about saying, ""Enough."

1153,1153," Yeah, well, with him we have incest."
1154,1154,"All right, very well."

1183,1183,"Quite a night, right?"
1184,1184,"I was just fired, actually."
1185,1185,What?
1186,1186,"Oh, it was worth it."
1187,1187,Tonight we did what theater should do.
1188,1188,But it wasn't your fault.
1189,1189,"Oh, I knew what I was getting into."
1190,1190,I told your parents when we were preparing this thing that the best art always leaves scorched earth in its wake.
1191,1191,Scorched earth.
1192,1192,What do you mean?
1193,1193,When we were preparing this thing?
1194,1194,Your parents didn't tell you?
1195,1195,It was their idea.
1196,1196,But I was honored to be a part of it.
1197,1197,"You might not believe it, but I studied at my university."
1198,1198,I studied in the experimental theater wing.
1199,1199,So your parents are just two of the most important avantgarde artists of our time.
1200,1200,"Of course, I helped them."
1201,1201,"Well, what about Coby Reed?"
1202,1202,How'd you know he'd just crash his car?
1203,1203,"Oh, your parents took care of him."
1204,1204,"No, no, no, no."
1205,1205,"Goodness, no."
1206,1206,They paid him $500 to drop out of the play.
1207,1207,The crash was just bad luck.
1208,1208,Why would they do all that?
1209,1209,"For art, darling."
1210,1210,laughs For art.
1211,1211,"We're such cattle, you know?"
1212,1212,"People need to be shaken up, snapped out of it, look around, see things in a new way."
1213,1213,"That's what we try to do in our work, because if you shake something up hard enough, it gets transformed."
1214,1214,It's not really about what we do.
1215,1215,It's what they do.
1216,1216, Yeah.
1217,1217, The people watching.
1218,1218,"Our work has an effect on them, because we wake them up."
1219,1219,We bring them back to life.
1220,1220, Mmhmm.
1221,1221,It's a resurrection.
1222,1222,And not a reflection of the human condition?
1223,1223, No. You know it's not.
1224,1224,Who wants to see a reflection of the human condition?
1225,1225,I suppose that happens when our pieces are shown in galleries.
1226,1226,"""Oh, look what they did."
1227,1227,Look how people responded.
1228,1228,"It's so human and wonderful."" But that's not the art."
1229,1229,"To me, by then, you know, it's over."
1230,1230,"Yeah, we really only do gallery shows to get grants."
1231,1231,Mmhmm.
1232,1232,"The art is in the actual moment, as it's happening."
1233,1233,Real people really responding.
1234,1234,"The actual human condition, not some artist's version of it."
1235,1235,But isn't that just life?
1236,1236,"Yes, exactly."
1237,1237,"Not a reflection of life, but life itself."
1238,1238,"Art and life, life and art."
1239,1239,We make them interchangeable.
1240,1240,And both are enriched because of it.
1241,1241,Do you think other art can do that?
1242,1242," No. What, painting?"
1243,1243,Photography?
1244,1244,That's the opposite.
1245,1245,That's death.
1246,1246,"Art happens when things move around, not when you freeze them in a block of ice."
1247,1247,glass shatters That was art.
1248,1248, laughs You're crazy.
1249,1249,This is not.
1250,1250,See?
1251,1251, laughs  Cheers.
1252,1252, Right?
1253,1253, That's right.
1254,1254,laughs  Did I surprise you?
1255,1255, You surprised me.
1256,1256,"You always do, don't you?"
1257,1257,"both laugh Anyway, that's what I mean."
1258,1258," Hey, Baxter?"
1259,1259, Yeah?
1260,1260,"The ""Romeo and Juliet"" thing."
1261,1261,"That was when it all stopped being simple, isn't it?"
1262,1262,"Well, isn't that when you left?"
1263,1263, No. I left because I went to college.
1264,1264,"Hey, why are you getting dressed up?"
1265,1265,I want to look the part.
1266,1266,What part?
1267,1267,The part of someone who gets up in front of a class and isn't completely petrified by it.
1268,1268, You're going?
1269,1269, Yeah. Is that wrong?
1270,1270,I just think it's a little strange.
1271,1271,"I mean, come on."
1272,1272,Making public appearances when your parents are missing?
1273,1273,"Well, I need the distraction."
1274,1274,"Oh, Baxter."
1275,1275,"Well, then I want to go."
1276,1276,I want to hear you speak.
1277,1277,I'm not really going to be speaking.
1278,1278,I'm just going to be answering their questions.
1279,1279, I don't care.
1280,1280,I want to go.
1281,1281,All right.
1282,1282,"I don't want you jumping in, though, okay?"
1283,1283,They just... they want to hear from me.
1284,1284,I won't say a word.
1285,1285, Good. What do you think?
1286,1286,What do I think?
1287,1287,I don't know.
1288,1288,Lose the ear thing.
1289,1289,"Well, it's there for medical reasons, but..."
1290,1290,I think it looks a bit...
1291,1291,Like I've been hurt.
1292,1292,Distracting.
1293,1293,They won't listen to your...
1294,1294,"It's not working with this or this, right?"
1295,1295, Because this is pretty tight.
1296,1296, Just lose the ear thing.
1297,1297,"So, this is Baxter Fang, author of ""House of Swans,"" which was nominated for the coveted Golden Quill Award."
1298,1298,"His second novel, ""The Underground"" was, befitting a second novel, a more complex and divisive book."
1299,1299,That's fair.
1300,1300,laughs He's going to talk to us today about the creative process.
1301,1301,"Baxter, take it away."
1302,1302,Okay.
1303,1303,Do they want to do just questions?
1304,1304,I can... let me present...
1305,1305,I'll present to you the how I work.
1306,1306,I'll tell you how I write.
1307,1307,I write by computer.
1308,1308,I do it all on computer.
1309,1309,And...
1310,1310,and I...
1311,1311,I chew gum.
1312,1312,I find that very helpful.
1313,1313,Maybe you could speak in more general terms.
1314,1314,"You know, like what drives you to put pen to paper."
1315,1315,"A little more general, generally?"
1316,1316, A little more general terms?
1317,1317, Yeah.
1318,1318,"Good, good."
1319,1319,Let's see.
1320,1320,Sometimes I get horrible thoughts in my head.
1321,1321,You guys ever get horrible thoughts in your head?
1322,1322,"You know, I can't get them out, so it helps me to write them down."
1323,1323,"Uh, when I was a kid I thought a lot about this one..."
1324,1324,"I mean, I thought about what would happen if my parents died."
1325,1325,"And, um..."
1326,1326,and I couldn't get it out of my head.
1327,1327,Can't. Couldn't.
1328,1328,Can't. And...
1329,1329,and you don't want to think about it.
1330,1330,"But if you do get stuck with it, I suggest you write it down."
1331,1331,That's what I did.
1332,1332,I've...
1333,1333,"well, my sister and I don't have relatives."
1334,1334,"So in my story, we get..."
1335,1335,we get taken to an orphanage.
1336,1336,And this orphanage is run by this woman.
1337,1337,And she mistreats all these kids.
1338,1338,She's very harsh to them.
1339,1339,"And my sister and I, we... we put up with..."
1340,1340,with all the...
1341,1341,the harsh treatment for months.
1342,1342,And then we figure out a way to escape.
1343,1343,"One night, under cover of darkness, we go through this incinerator chute."
1344,1344,"We get out the bottom of the chute, and we scoot off across this field of beets."
1345,1345,I had it as a field of beets.
1346,1346,"Anyway, so this is a field of beets."
1347,1347,And we're running across it and running across.
1348,1348,"We're looking over our shoulder, and all is good."
1349,1349,"We make it, we get to the other side, and there's this peaceful forest."
1350,1350,And we go into this forest.
1351,1351,And it's...
1352,1352,We think that all the hardship is behind us.
1353,1353,But then suddenly a sack goes over our heads.
1354,1354,"And we're taken away into this underground, like, lair."
1355,1355,And there's all these other kidnapped kids in there.
1356,1356,And another chapter of misery would kind of start from there.
1357,1357,I don't have that part yet.
1358,1358,But... anyway.
1359,1359,Anybody ever have terrible thoughts like that?
1360,1360, I do.
1361,1361, Do you.
1362,1362,All the time.
1363,1363,Just write them down.
1364,1364,"It's helpful for me, at least."
1365,1365,"You know, if I can't get it out of my head, I just..."
1366,1366,I write them down.
1367,1367,"Even if they're super weird, I can control them and I can... I can..."
1368,1368,"I can just... you know, I can control my world, you know, with writing."
1369,1369,That's what writing is for me.
1370,1370,Just...
1371,1371,sighs You have five new messages.
1372,1372,First new message.
1373,1373,"Hi, this is Anne Amotta from..."
1374,1374,answering machine beeps  Second new message.
1375,1375,This is WMAC in Albany.
1376,1376,We were hoping to schedule an interview in regards...
1377,1377,answering machine beeps  Third new message.
1378,1378,"Hey, this is Eddie Sanchez..."
1379,1379, Fourth new message.
1380,1380,"answering machine beeps Hey, this is Sheriff Hale."
1381,1381,I said I'd call when the blood results came back.
1382,1382,I'm afraid that the blood at the scene does match your dad's DNA profile.
1383,1383,"So it is real, which obviously none of us wanted."
1384,1384,But it does mean that we have a serious situation here.
1385,1385,"So we'll need to dig a bit deeper into the investigation, as we discussed."
1386,1386,I'd appreciate a call back.
1387,1387,Thank you.
1388,1388,answering machine beeps That doesn't mean anything.
1389,1389,Caleb's done crazier things than draw his own blood.
1390,1390,You know that.
1391,1391,Good night.
1392,1392,dramatic music âª âª Baxter!
1393,1393,I think I found something!
1394,1394,You were wrong.
1395,1395,You were wrong when you said that they didn't have any friends.
1396,1396,You forgot about Hobart.
1397,1397,Who's that?
1398,1398, Hobart Waxman.
1399,1399,Their mentor.
1400,1400,"If they told anyone about their disappearance, they would have told Hobart."
1401,1401,Can we talk about this tomorrow?
1402,1402,Because I'm right in the middle of this.
1403,1403, The middle of what?
1404,1404, I'm writing my book. I just...
1405,1405,"I've thought of something really good, and I'm..."
1406,1406," Oh, wow."
1407,1407,That's exciting.
1408,1408,I'm excited about it.
1409,1409,"So, what are we going to do about Hobart?"
1410,1410,"He's got to be dead, or pretty close to it."
1411,1411,Then we'd better find him soon.
1412,1412, Annie...
1413,1413, Come on.
1414,1414," I'm... no, I don't want..."
1415,1415," No, no, no."
1416,1416,Don't do this to me.
1417,1417,Don't make me do it by myself.
1418,1418,You promised. You promised that we'd help each other.
1419,1419,"The first year I was in Hobart's class, we went to see a piece by the artist Chris Burdon, whose work Hobart did not care for."
1420,1420, Chris Burdon's a hack.
1421,1421,A complete and utter fraud.
1422,1422,"So we're at Burdon's gallery, and he tell us he's going to be shot today."
1423,1423,"Sure enough, an assistant pulls out a gun and shoots him in the arm."
1424,1424,I was shocked.
1425,1425,I thought it was thrilling.
1426,1426,And I made the mistake of saying so in class.
1427,1427,So Hobart turns on me and he says...
1428,1428,It's horseshit!
1429,1429,Art should never happen in a controlled environment.
1430,1430,That's not art.
1431,1431,I don't know what it is.
1432,1432,Taxidermy.
1433,1433,"I mean, who the hell cares if you let somebody come and shoot you in a goddamn galley?"
1434,1434,There's no danger.
1435,1435,There's no... no surprise.
1436,1436,"No, it needs to take place in the world, around people who just don't know that it's art."
1437,1437,That's the way it has to be.
1438,1438,He was so disappointed in me.
1439,1439,I had to make it up to him somehow.
1440,1440,"Caleb and I were dating, and he asked me if I could run a camera."
1441,1441,So we hunkered down in a classroom on the fifth floor of the History Building with a window that overlooked the courtyard.
1442,1442,And we waited for Hobart to pass by.
1443,1443,âª Honey'd sweet apples âª âª They're rotting away âª âª Millions of people âª âª Never start in the race âª âª There's stuff on our plates âª âª That has not been alive âª âª Someone pays full price âª âª For my cheap flight life âª âª Sunshine âª He shot me with a crossbow.
1444,1444, laughing I... I shot him with a crossbow.
1445,1445,He almost used a rifle.
1446,1446,And thank God you didn't.
1447,1447,"No, he knew it was going to happen."
1448,1448,He just didn't know when.
1449,1449,There was a card in my pocket that said I'd been wounded by a friend.
1450,1450,"There was chaos, screaming, blood, silence."
1451,1451,"I remember lying there thinking, ""This is so beautiful."" He... he refused to give them my name."
1452,1452,Whoa!
1453,1453,both laugh  He's a good guy.
1454,1454," Yeah, he's all right."
1455,1455,Hobart.
1456,1456, Hobart.
1457,1457, You fat fuck.
1458,1458, laughs âª Sunshine âª âª We all see âª âª The same sky âª Wow.
1459,1459,It doesn't look like there's anybody here.
1460,1460,"So, what now?"
1461,1461,Even better.
1462,1462,"Let's find an open door, search the house."
1463,1463, Hang on.
1464,1464,What are you talking about?
1465,1465," Come on, let's split up."
1466,1466,Quick!
1467,1467, We're just going to break in?
1468,1468, Yeah.
1469,1469, Annie...
1470,1470, Come on.
1471,1471,"knob jiggles knob jiggles  Don't move, honey!"
1472,1472, Oh!
1473,1473,I'll put a hole in your boyfriend.
1474,1474,He's got a gun.
1475,1475,"Take it easy, Hobart."
1476,1476,You... you know us.
1477,1477,Annie. Annie Fang.
1478,1478,Holy shit.
1479,1479,Is this Baxter?
1480,1480, Yeah. Baxter.
1481,1481,Baxter Fang.
1482,1482,laughs I'll be damned!
1483,1483,"So can you take the gun out of my back now, please?"
1484,1484,"Oh, hell, I don't have a gun."
1485,1485,Just my finger.
1486,1486, Oh.
1487,1487," Bang, bang."
1488,1488,laughs You got me.
1489,1489,"Annie, I haven't seen you since you were a little thing."
1490,1490,"I watched all your movies, though."
1491,1491,"And you too, Baxter."
1492,1492,Those books are terrific.
1493,1493,Thank you.
1494,1494,"Well, not that second one."
1495,1495,That was...
1496,1496, Not for you?
1497,1497,"But the first one, that was very good."
1498,1498, Thank you.
1499,1499,"Yeah, the second one..."
1500,1500,The second one was...
1501,1501,that was a challenge.
1502,1502,"Third one's going to be good, though."
1503,1503,laughs So I read about your parents.
1504,1504,Awful story.
1505,1505,Think they're really dead?
1506,1506, I think it's very possible.
1507,1507," No, no, no. I don't."
1508,1508,I think you're helping them.
1509,1509,Is that why you're here?
1510,1510,"You're the only one who believes in them enough to not tell anyone else, so..."
1511,1511,They love you.
1512,1512,laughs They most certainly do not.
1513,1513,We had a falling out years ago.
1514,1514, Really?
1515,1515, Is that right?
1516,1516,Mmhmm.
1517,1517, Really?
1518,1518, Yeah.
1519,1519,"Well, what was it about?"
1520,1520,sighs It's not my place to say.
1521,1521,Can I offer you a little advice?
1522,1522,Sure.
1523,1523,Stop looking for them.
1524,1524,"It was a bad idea, tangling up family and art."
1525,1525,It...
1526,1526,But maybe you're free of that now.
1527,1527,You need to stop thinking of this as a slight and start thinking of it as a gift.
1528,1528,Yeah.
1529,1529,A gift.
1530,1530,brakes squeal I know I shouldn't.
1531,1531,What is this?
1532,1532,They were lost after you left.
1533,1533,The work suffered terribly.
1534,1534,"So a few years back, I offered to finance a documentary on them, to celebrate what you'd all done."
1535,1535,But also to close that chapter so they could move on to something new.
1536,1536,A documentary.
1537,1537, Yeah. It was a...
1538,1538,it was a terrible idea.
1539,1539,"We never released it, obviously."
1540,1540,But you asked about the falling out.
1541,1541,"Tell me, did you ever think that what you were doing might have an adverse affect on the children?"
1542,1542, No. Children are amazingly resilient.
1543,1543,"When my cousin Jeffrey was 2, he got stuck in a well for three days."
1544,1544,And now he's got a family and he sells vinyl siding.
1545,1545,So there you go.
1546,1546,And when did you decide that you wanted to use them in the work?
1547,1547,"""A"" was a baby."
1548,1548,"And, to be honest, after she was born I was..."
1549,1549,"Well, I was miserable."
1550,1550,"I thought, ""This is the end of our life.""  As artists."
1551,1551," Obviously as artists, because... and I've heard this over again, children kill art."
1552,1552,They just do.
1553,1553,"You have them, and the passion you had for creative expression becomes secondary."
1554,1554,Some people believe that.
1555,1555,"I went into a terrible funk, but then the most wonderful thing happened."
1556,1556,"Near Christmas, we took the baby to see Santa at the mall."
1557,1557, It was my idea.
1558,1558,I thought it'd be cute.
1559,1559, We grabbed the camera.
1560,1560,We go down there.
1561,1561,And I put A on this rancid hobo's lap.
1562,1562,"And she, of course, screams, but in a way I'd never heard."
1563,1563,"It was like something conjured by the dark arts, like a horde of demons were going to fly out of her mouth."
1564,1564,And poor Santa's trying to shake her loose.
1565,1565,The elves go running for the break room.
1566,1566,"Families grab their children, run from the line."
1567,1567,"It was pandemonium, and an epiphany for me."
1568,1568,"I thought, children don't have to kill art."
1569,1569,Not if they are the art.
1570,1570,"no audio For the first time I thought, ""Hey..."
1571,1571,"I think I want kids.""  laughs Jesus."
1572,1572,Don't say that.
1573,1573, It's true.
1574,1574,"Um, you know, I don't want that in there."
1575,1575, Why?
1576,1576, I want that whole last section cut.
1577,1577, Why? That was great.
1578,1578, What he said about the kids.
1579,1579, That was great stuff.
1580,1580,"No, Hobart, no."
1581,1581, What? But...
1582,1582," No, if you put that in there, I swear I'm not coming back."
1583,1583," Come on, where are you going?"
1584,1584, I'm done with this.
1585,1585,"No, not unless you promise me."
1586,1586,If we're going to tell the story don't we have to tell the real story?
1587,1587, Baxter.
1588,1588, Hmm?
1589,1589,I know how to find them.
1590,1590," Annie, it's late."
1591,1591,Go to bed.
1592,1592," No, no, no, no."
1593,1593,Mom's paintings.
1594,1594,We do this gallery show.
1595,1595,"We call it ""The Hidden Art of Camille Fang,"" and we promote it like a memorial, and then Caleb will come out of hiding."
1596,1596,He will be incensed.
1597,1597,He will rail against it.
1598,1598,What do you think of that?
1599,1599,What do you think?
1600,1600," Please, come on."
1601,1601,I think you're drunk. Come on.
1602,1602, I'm not drunk.
1603,1603, I can smell it.
1604,1604," No, I've had a drink."
1605,1605,I'm not drunk.
1606,1606,"Turn off that goddamn light right now and go to bed, Annie."
1607,1607,Stop watching that fucking documentary.
1608,1608,I have a friend who has a gallery.
1609,1609, You sound like an idiot.
1610,1610,I'm finished with this.
1611,1611,I'm all done.
1612,1612,I'm done helping you with this search.
1613,1613,I'm done with the road trips and the corkboard.
1614,1614,"I'm doing all this because I'm your brother, Annie, and I love you, and I think that you might need all this stuff to help you get through all this stuff with Mom and Dad."
1615,1615,But I'm starting to think that you're just avoiding it.
1616,1616, Avoiding what?
1617,1617, I think you're just avoiding the truth.
1618,1618,Come on.
1619,1619,"sighs And if they're not dead, they want everyone to think that they are, including their own kids."
1620,1620,"So if we find them, what difference does it make?"
1621,1621,You can't say anything to them to make them change who they are.
1622,1622,You don't know that.
1623,1623," Yes, I do."
1624,1624,"And for some reason, you've got some crazy idea in your head that suddenly they're going to stop being who they are."
1625,1625,"And they're going to stop doing the things that they do, and being the people that they are, Annie."
1626,1626,"That they're going to suddenly become these normal parents, and it's going to help you fix all of your... stuff."
1627,1627,It's just not going to happen.
1628,1628,We can't fix them.
1629,1629,We can only fix ourselves.
1630,1630,"Can we, though?"
1631,1631,Yeah.
1632,1632,I think we can.
1633,1633,And moving on is the start.
1634,1634,"You think they're dead, don't you?"
1635,1635,You thought it the whole time.
1636,1636,I don't know.
1637,1637,"If they're dead, it's horrible."
1638,1638,But if they're not dead...
1639,1639,it's kind of worse.

1836,1836, Ridiculous.
1837,1837, We needed the blood.
1838,1838,What's Mom's fake name?
1839,1839,Patty Howard.
1840,1840,Does she have a fake family too?
1841,1841,No.
1842,1842,"See, Bonnie inherited this cabin up north."
1843,1843,"Mom's been spending summers there, getting to know people in town so it wouldn't be suspicious when she settled there."
1844,1844,So this has been in the works for a while.
1845,1845,"For several years, yes."
1846,1846,We had to be thorough.
1847,1847,Create new identities we could slip into when Caleb and Camille died.
1848,1848,"We needed social security numbers, bank accounts, tax history."
1849,1849,"Otherwise, it wouldn't have worked."

1852,1852,"Hello, Patty."
1853,1853,Here's how this is going to go.
1854,1854,"You're going to answer a couple of questions, and then you're going to do what I tell you next."
1855,1855,Let's start at why?
1856,1856, The work. Why else?
1857,1857,This was meant to be our defining work.
1858,1858,An event so large it would overshadow everything we'd done before.
1859,1859,But then it became clear that you no longer saw value in our work.
1860,1860,We knew we couldn't trust you with the plan.
1861,1861,We kept it from you.
1862,1862,So you suckered in Miss Delano instead to help you?
1863,1863,We didn't sucker in anyone.
1864,1864,She came on willingly long ago.
1865,1865,Some people appreciate our work.
1866,1866,He and Bonnie were to live as husband and wife in appearance only.
1867,1867,And that worked for a couple of years.
1868,1868,But things happened.
1869,1869,You're adults.
1870,1870,You know that.
1871,1871,Hold on a second.
1872,1872,You're actually the father of those boys?
1873,1873,Every piece has its own complications.
1874,1874,"And for what it's worth, the boys did help with the cover story."
1875,1875, Wow. You actually replaced us.
1876,1876,No one replaced anyone.
1877,1877,You didn't want to work with us.
1878,1878,Why did you put up with all this?
1879,1879,The art.
1880,1880,Everything we've ever done is for the art.
1881,1881,"No, it wasn't just the art, Caleb."
1882,1882,You know that.
1883,1883,Everything I do is out of love for you.
1884,1884,And I made him a promise after you were born.
1885,1885,"He wanted to leave, and I swore to him."
1886,1886,"that if he figured out a way to be happy and still stay, then I'd always do the same for him."
1887,1887,Even sacrifice your own children?
1888,1888, Don't say that.
1889,1889, Come on.
1890,1890,"When push came to shove every time, you chose him over us."
1891,1891,"For God's sake, you talk like I'm a monster."
1892,1892,We had a good life.
1893,1893,You were happy children.
1894,1894,You forget how fun those pieces could be.
1895,1895,The thrill of leaping in...
1896,1896," Oh, give me a break."
1897,1897,"No net, not knowing what was going to happen."
1898,1898,You're telling me that wasn't fun?
1899,1899,The adventures we had.
1900,1900,What did other kids do?
1901,1901,Go to the Grand Canyon.
1902,1902,Disney World?
1903,1903,We did something important.
1904,1904,"I think I would have preferred Disney World, okay?"
1905,1905, If you're asking.
1906,1906," Yeah, and a mom and a dad."
1907,1907,I've always loved you kids.
1908,1908,"Whatever ambivalence I might have felt early on, it turned into love."
1909,1909,"As long as we didn't do shitty movies and compromise your artistic sensibilities, huh?"
1910,1910,"What, I'm not allowed to disapprove your choices?"
1911,1911,That's like the main thing parents do.
1912,1912,What's your take on the Vengeful Virgins?
1913,1913,"That stupid CD, that damn song, it nearly ruined everything."
1914,1914,Promise your dad that you won't tell.
1915,1915," No, we're pulling the plug."
1916,1916,This little piece is over.
1917,1917, The hell it is.
1918,1918, The hell it isn't.
1919,1919,"I'm going to take this, I'm going to go right to the press."
1920,1920, You give that to me.
1921,1921, No.
1922,1922,You're going to ruin years of work because your feelings got hurt.
1923,1923," That's right, Pop."
1924,1924," Come on, just be reasonable, both of you, and just don't blow this up."
1925,1925," Well, that's what we Fangs do."
1926,1926,We blow things up.
1927,1927,"Look, we get it."
1928,1928,You think we damaged you.
1929,1929,Fine. My parents damaged me.
1930,1930,Her parents damaged her.
1931,1931,You have kids.
1932,1932,You're going to damage them.
1933,1933,That's what parents do.
1934,1934,So what?
1935,1935,I'm not a young man anymore.
1936,1936,This is the last big thing I'll ever make.
1937,1937,"Come visit once a year, and just please don't tell."
1938,1938,You want us to pretend you're dead?
1939,1939,Sure.

1957,1957,What?
