1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,792
Mike! What the hell are you doing?

2
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,234
It's called driving, Marcus.

3
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,635
Slow down.

4
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,520
What? Four minutes?

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,670
Speed up.

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,151
Oh, so you want me to speed up
and slow down at the same time?

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Moving southbound on Collins.

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,033
Fast approaching 22 Street.

9
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,197
<i>Copy that.
Air support has a visual.</i>

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,195
Mike!

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,394
I'm about to throw up.

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,437
Oh, you bett... The hell not.

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,716
That is hand-stitched leather.
You better drink it.

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,317
<i>I'm blocking off 6th Street now.</i>

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
That was your turn, Mike!

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,954
Damn it! Look, you are the navigator, okay?
That's why you're sitting in that seat.

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,874
And where are your glasses?
You need to put your glasses on.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,555
- I don't need glasses.
- Marcus, you can't see shit.

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,916
Oh, sh... Mike. Mike. Mike.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,992
- Relax. Relax. Relax!
- Mike. Bus, bus, bus.

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Sorry, rich white people.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,190
We're not just black, we're cops too.

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,317
We'll pull ourselves over later.

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,273
Hey, even the Batmobile don't hold
the road like this bitch.

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,312
Get me the fuck out of this car.

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,596
- Hey!
- Oh, shit.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,515
Come on, man.

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,514
- You can get that buffed out.
- No. You can get that buffed out.

29
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,831
- Miami PD. Make a hole.
- Coming through.

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,354
- Make a hole. Miami PD.
- Miami PD.

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,079
Go! Go!

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Sorry.

33
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,800
Daddy!

34
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,753
Joker.

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,354
You a pop-pop.

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,391
- Baby, look at him.
- Yeah.

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
No doubt. It's in the eyes.

38
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,270
And the ears.

39
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
And the name.

40
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,471
Marcus Miles Burnett.

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,676
But that's my name.

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,999
His name too. We decided to name him
after you. It was Reggie's idea.

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,711
Thought it would be a very respectful
gesture, sir. I hope you approve.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,234
That's cool.

45
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,075
But you know you still need to make
a honest woman out of my baby girl there.

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,231
Uncle Mike,
ready to hold the baby?

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,435
No. Uncle Mike don't want to
catch that.

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,512
Okay? That's that shit.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,954
- No, Mike.
- Stop.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,714
- Look at the baby.
- Stop it right now. Seriously.

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Look at the baby.

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,998
Okay, you know what? I'll be outside
when you get your shit together.

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,474
Mike.

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,597
- The baby.
- Oh, it's okay.

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,318
Let's go, ladies.

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,153
You're useless.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,913
Move it!

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,996
Aretas.

59
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,550
Aretas.

60
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,990
What the fuck?

61
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Stop the ambulance!

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,596
Mama.

63
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
My son.

64
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,952
Don't be sad for his death.

65
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,754
The spirit of your father is free
from the bars that confined him.

66
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,192
This is the last gift
from Papa before he died.

67
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,433
You're a man now. You're finally ready
for what needs to be done.

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,150
You must bring honor
and respect back to our family.

69
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,793
Your father hid millions
of dollars before he was locked up.

70
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,349
Here are the coordinates
where you can find them.

71
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,832
We'll take back what's ours.

72
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,593
With this money,
we can finally get revenge.

73
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,830
The people who destroyed our family will know
how it feels to be hunted.

74
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,190
He dies last.

75
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,599
Come here, Marcus.
Come here.

76
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,799
We're here to celebrate
and to raise a glass to one of our own.

77
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,671
And I sincerely hope that someday
your namesake follows in the footsteps

78
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
of his old-ass grandpa

79
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,473
to protect and serve our fair city.

80
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
To Marcus.

81
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,791
- To Marcus!
- To Marcus!

82
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,190
May the name Marcus Burnett strike fear into the hearts
and minds of assholes for years to come.

83
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,715
Thank y'all.
Thank... Thank you all.

84
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,471
Mike and I, we're going on 25 years
of working these streets.

85
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,711
And I like to think
we made a difference.

86
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,917
You all are the best.

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,799
And I thank you.
It's been a real honor.

88
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,793
Marcus!

89
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,033
<i>Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!</i>

90
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,191
Daddy buried that cash deep, huh?

91
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,840
If these are empty,
you're still gonna owe.

92
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Buried treasure in the ocean.

93
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,034
I heard the stories
<i>pero co√±o...</i>

94
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,318
Should cover the cost of
the materials we discussed.

95
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
And then some.

96
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,117
This is what you get to keep.

97
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
What'd you say?

98
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,714
We had a deal.

99
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,553
I'm renegotiating.

100
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Come here.

101
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Look at me.

102
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,114
I don't renegotiate.

103
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,355
My family's taking back
management of this town.

104
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,873
We're gonna need some loyal employees.

105
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,189
Who wants a job?

106
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,354
So how's your dental?

107
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,510
Say that again.

108
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,719
Stay calm.

109
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,194
You give yourselves a raise.
You start with that pile right there.

110
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Okay?

111
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Okay.

112
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,954
You work for me now.

113
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,074
Get your people to fall in line, stay out
of my fucking way, and I won't kill you.

114
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,316
Get this money.

115
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,234
Mama.

116
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
<i>Armando.</i>

117
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,520
It's ours.

118
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,520
That was fast.

119
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,591
<i>We got a new base of
operations too.</i>

120
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,674
<i>You've spent so much time on the other side,
you sound like a gringo.</i>

121
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,154
I'm done, Mike.

122
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,394
Oh, here we go again.

123
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,472
No, this time it's different.

124
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,997
When I looked into that little baby's eyes,
something changed.

125
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,073
I want to spend my days
watching that little boy grow.

126
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,517
Theresa does not want your ass sitting
at home, getting fat and breaking shit.

127
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,112
Mike, we got more time
behind us than in front.

128
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,635
It's time to make some changes,
for real.

129
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,519
You can miss me with that.
I'm living my best life.

130
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,796
You're dyeing your goatee, Mike.

131
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,031
- What?
- You're dyeing your goatee.

132
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,077
I am not dyeing my goatee.

133
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,311
That's Midnight Cocoa Bean.
I recognize that shit.

134
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,790
- Go ahead with that shit.
- That ain't Midnight Cocoa...?

135
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,076
- Go ahead somewhere.
- Let me ask you something.

136
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,234
You want your legacy to be
muscle shirts and a body count?

137
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,312
Don't you know family is
all that matters?

138
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,993
Hey, granddaddy!

139
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,833
- Rita.
- Oh, no. Pop-pop.

140
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,195
He's going with Pop-pop.

141
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,350
- Pop-pop?
- Yeah.

142
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,635
Got pics, Pop-pop?

143
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,753
- Oh, you know I do, right? There you go.
- Let's see.

144
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,438
Oh, my God, the ears!

145
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,718
Yeah, my grandbaby.
That's my grandbaby.

146
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
I love him.

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,759
Yeah. And congrats to you,
lieutenant.

148
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,355
I hear Howard tapped you
to head up AMMO.

149
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,635
Congrats.

150
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,915
What's AMMO?

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,151
Advanced Miami Metro Operations.

152
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,398
A small team trained in new tactics
and investigative methods.

153
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,756
Gonna replace us old dogs.

154
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,593
Or teach them some new tricks.

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,870
For real, Marcus.
So happy for you.

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you.

157
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,913
Hey, guys!

158
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,754
Hey! Everyone's here.

159
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
How are you?

160
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,513
Dumbass.

161
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,757
- What?
- She is perfect for you.

162
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,991
Smart as hell.

163
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,833
Confident. Ambitious.

164
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,752
She just wasn't the one for me.

165
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
- All right?
- What is for you?

166
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,391
Dying all alone and sad as shit?

167
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,709
You just jealous.

168
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,713
- How long you been married? Twenty years?
- Twenty-six.

169
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Tell the truth.
When's the last time you had sex?

170
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,593
- That ain't none of your damn business.
- Exactly.

171
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,434
How many great women
are you gonna let go?

172
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,355
You get a lot of loving,
but have you ever really been in love?

173
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,751
Of course. I mean, yeah,
I was... I was in love.

174
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,875
One time.

175
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,272
A long, long time ago.

176
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,635
You never told me.

177
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,877
Nigga, I don't tell you
all my business.

178
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,796
Look, all you need to know is that
I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100.

179
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,159
You the last brother that needs to be talking
about running down anyone after the hospital.

180
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,517
The hospital? What you talking about?
What happened at the hospital?

181
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,193
Running to see baby Marcus.

182
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,959
I dusted your ass.

183
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,590
You spent that run staring
at my one good ass-cheek, Mike.

184
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,720
You're saying that you actually outran me?
You beat me in a footrace?

185
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,280
It's been said.

186
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,555
Oh, hell, no.

187
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,519
Nothing sadder than old men
revisiting the past.

188
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,080
Hey, no stretching.

189
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,913
Stretching is cheating.

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,116
Hey, who you got, Cap?

191
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,396
I got 50 on a torn ACL.

192
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,551
I ain't running for free.
What's the bet?

193
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,438
I win, we lay it down.

194
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,399
We turn in our papers and we retire.

195
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,269
All right, when I win, you stop all this
foolish retirement talk.

196
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,592
We ride this thing till
the wheels fall off. Bad boys for life.

197
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,477
Bad boys ain't really boys anymore.

198
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,112
Hey, Cap, just have the ambo on standby.
Old boy gonna need fluids and oxygen.

199
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,311
- That's him, Cap. That's him.
- Okay.

200
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,234
On your mark, get set, go!

201
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,437
- Go, Marcus! You got this!
- Where you at?

202
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,637
- You got this, baby! Breathe!
- Where you at?

203
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,790
Come on, baby!

204
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,714
Breathe, baby, breathe!
Go!

205
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,235
Where you at, baby?!

206
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,951
Mike!

207
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,117
- Mike. Mike! Oh, shit! Get some help!
- Captain Howard.

208
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,592
I got an officer down.
We're on Ocean Drive, 700 block.

209
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
- Hold on.
- Gunshot wound.

210
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,760
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

211
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,832
- Just get... Get some help!
- Who did this?!

212
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,799
- Who the fuck did this?!
- The shooter's driving a black motorcycle...

213
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,559
Come on. Don't do this.
Don't do this.

214
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,359
- Mike, stay with us.
- Come on.

215
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,920
Get an ambulance!

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,037
- Come on, Mike. Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

217
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,600
Phone... I got him on the phone.

218
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,592
You gonna be all right. You gonna make it through this.
Come on, man. Stay with us, man.

219
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,320
Come on, Mike. I'm right here.

220
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,150
Dear God...

221
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,639
it's me, Marcus.

222
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,795
You blessed me
with a lot of stuff lately.

223
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,393
<i>I know I haven't been
to church in a while.</i>

224
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,358
<i>Probably Easter.</i>

225
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,318
<i>But I ain't gonna lie,</i>

226
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,198
<i>I wasn't paying attention.</i>

227
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,753
I haven't lost faith.

228
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,990
It's just...

229
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,117
I was ashamed at some of
the stuff we had to do.

230
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,439
<i>I know "thou shall not kill,"</i>

231
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,309
<i>but they were bad guys,
all of them.</i>

232
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,519
<i>You know, Mike hardly had
a life yet.</i>

233
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,956
<i>No wife, no kids.</i>

234
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,636
<i>If you could just please find
it in your heart</i>

235
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,320
to give him one more chance, man.

236
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,711
<i>Straight up,
he's my best friend.</i>

237
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,950
<i>My brother.</i>

238
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,710
If you just spare him,

239
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,156
I swear to you,

240
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,472
I will put no more violence
in this world.

241
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,476
<i>A drive-by shooting has a famed Miami Dade
police officer fighting for his life.</i>

242
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,758
<i>Witnesses report hearing shots
and a blacked-out bike fleeing the scene.</i>

243
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,038
<i>Detective Mike Lowrey remains
in critical condition.</i>

244
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,473
Let's run Cap through what we got on the case.
Kelly, run us through ballistics.

245
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,553
So the slugs in Officer Lowrey
were SS190.

246
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,155
P90 fires that caliber,
the Herstal.

247
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,074
But these were subsonic 5.7-by-28s,
custom rounds.

248
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
I wanna know who made those bullets.

249
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,675
We are watching 4chan and cross-referencing
the players in the market with the feds' red lines.

250
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,592
Mike's like a son to me.

251
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,119
I want this asshole.

252
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,799
This is personal for me too.

253
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,075
- Let's bring every single thing we got, all right?
- You got it.

254
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,038
I made it clear,
Lowrey dies last.

255
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,271
I'm the one up here.

256
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,920
I've learned how to handle things,
all right?

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,992
<i>You've had me
training my whole life.</i>

258
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,914
The cop was a threat.
The others are nothing!

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
<i>Do you listen to me or not?</i>

260
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,837
I wanted him to see the others die.

261
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,513
<i>Just finish it.</i>

262
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,398
<i>Never disobey me again!</i>

263
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,716
<i>Retired DA Rodrigo Vargas was
gunned down this afternoon.</i>

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,997
<i>The DEA is mourning Dr. Jack Weber this evening,
a 20-year forensic investigator for the agency in Miami.</i>

265
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
There you are.

266
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,475
<i>In yet another
execution-style homicide,</i>

267
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,834
<i>Judge Leon Sorenson was shot outside
his courthouse late Wednesday.</i>

268
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,319
<i>The war on law enforcement continues.</i>

269
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,395
Three other law enforcement personnel
have been killed that could be linked to our case.

270
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,598
- It's a war on the goddamn law.
- All the same shooter as Mike.

271
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,356
- Connected how?
- Traffic cams, witnesses, tire treads,

272
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,909
all put the same blacked-out bike
at the scene.

273
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,756
We want to thank you all
for joining us today.

274
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,032
It means a lot to the family.

275
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,193
And I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

276
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,194
I really gotta stop crying
like this.

277
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,360
Hey, you guys are great.

278
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our first toast.

279
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,351
I'm going to bring up
Officer Mike Lowrey,

280
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,832
affectionately known as Uncle Mike.

281
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,832
All right. Let's do this.

282
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,394
First off, Reggie,

283
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,872
I am shocked that you are even still here.

284
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,236
I remember your first date with Megan,

285
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,231
and trust me, me and Marcus did everything
we could possibly do to make sure you never came back.

286
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,710
But I'm telling you,
love is hard.

287
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,838
And your relationship
will be tested.

288
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,355
And your father and I have weathered
storm after storm.

289
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,036
And we have a mantra that
we say to each other

290
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
in our darkest days,

291
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,400
and it always seems
to bring us back together.

292
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,871
And, Reggie, Megan,
I would like to share it with you.

293
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,795
We ride together,

294
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
- we die together.
- We die together.

295
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,111
Bad boys for life!

296
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
No.

297
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,920
- No, what?
- You know what.

298
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,711
From the minute I heard you were still breathing,
I've been waiting for the shit to hit the fan.

299
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,474
Look at me, Mike. No.

300
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,076
- You don't even know what I'm gonna say.
- I know you. I know what you're gonna say.

301
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,553
AMMO's got this.

302
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,074
AMMO?

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,514
Come on, Cap.
AMMO?

304
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,231
With all due respect,
AMMO is a high school musical...

305
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,198
boy band with guns.

306
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,794
They don't even have shit.

307
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,270
How do you know what they have
or don't have? They have!

308
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,875
- What do they have? What?
- They have.

309
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,716
The bullets they carved out of you,
they were custom rounds for the P90 Herstal.

310
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,919
AMMO's gonna find the dealer

311
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,753
- that supplied your shooter.
- How?

312
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,557
- State-of-the-art police work, that's how.
- Cap, look... All right.

313
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
- Sir.
- Sir?

314
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,669
You are desperate.

315
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,435
But I can't.

316
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,876
Mike, I can't let you
investigate your own case.

317
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,397
- All right. Let me investigate the Vargas case.
- No.

318
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,474
The last thing I need is having IAD shoving
a Hubble telescope up my ass

319
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,153
for a full-on colonoscopy.

320
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,392
- You know the rules.
- Fuck the rules, Cap.

321
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,196
Come on. Put me and Marcus
on this shit.

322
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,517
Have you talked to your partner?

323
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,598
You retired?

324
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,230
It's my daughter's wedding, Mike.
Do we have to do this right now?

325
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Yeah.

326
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,273
- I told you I was retiring.
- Wha...? What?

327
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,319
Wait, nah, hold up.
We raced, you lost.

328
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,472
Now you reneging? What happened
to bad boys for life?

329
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,836
Yeah, for life. It's off.

330
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,354
You died.

331
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,636
What? What the hell are you
talking about?

332
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,832
You coded out, Mike,
three times.

333
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
Marcus, look,

334
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,235
this motherfucker stole something
from me and I need it back.

335
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,312
What did he take
from you, Mike?

336
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,760
You're still here.

337
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,356
All he took from you was the legend,
"Bulletproof Mike."

338
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,671
But I saw you
on the ground bleeding.

339
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,594
You're human, just like
the rest of us.

340
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,478
Yeah, his ass bleeds too.

341
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,194
I'm telling you, Mike.

342
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,352
You go out there for vengeance,
you gonna get someone killed.

343
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,432
Oh, we definitely bringing
some smoke.

344
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,632
That fool put holes in me!

345
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,155
And you're filling them
with hate, Mike.

346
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,359
Look, you need to start thinking
about your karma, man.

347
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,079
This was a sign.

348
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,755
A sign, yeah.
A sign to turn up.

349
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,196
So I'm supposed to bow down now?
Give this bitch a pass?

350
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,678
"Turn up"?
What are you, 20?

351
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,514
You need to turn that shit off.

352
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,398
You know, Mike...

353
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,439
Rita called me every day you were
in the hospital.

354
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,592
There's something still there,
a future.

355
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,832
My future is hunting
this motherfucker.

356
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,400
Well, it's not mine.

357
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,993
All right.
So let me get this straight.

358
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,519
So somebody get to dump my ass out
in the street

359
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,159
and you ain't gonna do shit?

360
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,435
You just gonna quit?

361
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,874
How dare you, man?

362
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,156
I sat by your bedside.

363
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,993
I wiped the drool
off your chin, Mike.

364
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,638
- Don't disrespect me like that because you don't know.
- All right. All right, man.

365
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,112
Look, Marcus,

366
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,470
I'm asking you.

367
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,714
I'm begging you, man.

368
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,989
I need this.

369
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,750
Bad boys...

370
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,629
one last time.

371
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,910
No, Mike.

372
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
No.

373
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,837
Everything for you, Papa.

374
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,880
Mama.

375
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,553
<i>He didn't die.</i>

376
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,916
<i>Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

377
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,550
Santa Muerte wouldn't let him die
before he suffered as we have.

378
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,996
<i>Don't kill him
until I tell you.</i>

379
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
He will suffer.

380
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,871
A little something
for your fans...

381
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,716
<i>Video of a shooting of
a Miami detective has surfaced online,</i>

382
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,871
<i>going viral in a matter
of hours.</i>

383
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,751
<i>The video first appeared on the darknet
and soon spread to mainstream social media.</i>

384
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,958
<i>Authorities believe the shooter uploaded
the video himself.</i>

385
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,954
Too slow.

386
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,275
You're slipping.

387
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,517
Still had the key.

388
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
What's up?

389
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,275
Howard told me you wanted back in.
Obviously, that can't happen.

390
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Says who?

391
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,231
Michael, you got shot.

392
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,678
- Yeah, people keep reminding me of that.
- Well, why do you think that is?

393
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,430
- Oh, you shrinking me now.
- You always say that when you don't wanna get real.

394
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,036
No, I always say that
when you start shrinking me.

395
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,959
Hey, this is the type of case
that AMMO was built for.

396
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,432
- You just have to trust me, that's all.
- Oh, come on. What?

397
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,352
Why you always go there?

398
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,831
This don't have nothing to do
with me trusting you or not.

399
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,832
- Oh, no?
- No.

400
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,235
Are you even healed?

401
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,753
- Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.
- Yeah?

402
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,758
- You sure you're fine?
- Oh, shit. Rita.

403
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,593
- You sure you're fine?
- Rita. Stop.

404
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,191
- Hey. This is me you're trying to bullshit.
- Rita...

405
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,559
If you get involved, you're gonna
make mistakes you can't take back.

406
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,431
What does that mean?
Where'd you get that?

407
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,795
Until you burn?

408
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,997
Until you die?

409
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,074
You know me well enough
to know not to ask me to quit.

410
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,715
It's because I know you,
I'm asking.

411
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,153
Because I care about you.

412
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,749
As a friend.

413
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,279
Let us handle this.

414
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,477
Shit. Alexa, turn down
the volume.

415
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,475
Marcus! You need to get out
of the house!

416
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,835
Sorry, baby.

417
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,195
So sorry.

418
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,999
How about a spa day?

419
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,991
- Is that Manny's car?
- Yeah.

420
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,713
- Where's Manny?
- In the back.

421
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,111
Oh, shit. Mike Lowrey.
What are you doing here, man?

422
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,714
You look like a ghost, man.

423
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,033
You know they say you're dead, fuckboy.
I got to show you something.

424
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,192
The streets is talking.
That cop shit ain't working for you.

425
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,237
Come work for me
at Manny's Prime Rib.

426
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,154
See, look,
you get dropped right here.

427
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,390
And guess what.

428
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
You're trending worldwide.

429
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,679
My fucking hand, man!

430
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,400
Yo, this ain't
no fucking cop shit, man!

431
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,797
What happened about reading my rights?
This is not how it's supposed to go.

432
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,238
You're supposed to ask me questions,
and then I tell you, "Go fuck yourself!"

433
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,915
What the fuck, man?

434
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,593
Fuck!

435
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,038
- My fucking hand, man.
- P90 Herstals, custom, who's making them?

436
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,072
Mike, I'm not
in the game no more.

437
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,914
Oh, nah?
Okay. My bad.

438
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,550
- Mike, Mike, fucking chill, man.
- So all these vegans in Miami,

439
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,873
and you want me to believe that that hot rod
you got outside comes from selling pork chops?

440
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,351
I work at Manny's. I'm a family man,
and I'm a hardworking man.

441
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,396
I got you...

442
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,317
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

443
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,000
- Did you just get pig fat on my suit?
- Oh, shit.

444
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,480
Sorry, Mike.

445
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,596
Sorry.

446
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,673
No! Booker Grassie!

447
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,355
That's the name! Booker Grassie!

448
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,352
That's the name, man!

449
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,798
Yo, Mike! Mike! Yo, Mike!

450
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,678
The handcuffs, man!

451
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,950
Booker Grassie.

452
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,273
Only arms dealer in Miami customizing
for the P90 Herstal.

453
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,396
What'd I tell you?

454
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,518
I know. I'm not supposed to investigate
my own case. I know the rules.

455
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,633
But this fool posted a video
of him trying to kill me.

456
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
I saw it.

457
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,591
- I can go after him vigilante style, or you can bring me in.
- Or I could shoot you myself.

458
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Fuck me!

459
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,430
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

460
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,276
If...

461
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,674
I bring you in, to consult,

462
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,672
and you go cowboy on me,

463
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,152
I need you to comprehend
the level-five shitstorm I will be drowning in.

464
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,197
No gold-plated watch.

465
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,718
No cop retirement village.
I'm sticking myself out on a skinny limb!

466
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,237
Scratch that.
A twig in an ice storm!

467
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,880
Me, on the edge, "tithering."

468
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,394
You mean, teetering?

469
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,034
That's what I said!

470
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,555
And picture me very fat!

471
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,919
- Think I got the image, Cap.
<i>- What is he doing here?</i>

472
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,990
He's gonna be helping out.

473
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,958
- I don't want him.
- I'm not working with her.

474
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,158
He's not. You're not.
He's consulting. It's your show.

475
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,390
- Captain, come on.
- Wait.

476
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,598
I know you guys got history together,
so let's not make it personal.

477
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,954
- Personal? I'm the only one being a professional here.
- This is not d√©tente. I'm informing you of my decision.

478
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,199
- This is a bad idea.
- He's gonna investigate this case, no matter what!

479
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,956
So this way, we keep him
on a short leash, we control him.

480
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm standing right here, Cap.

481
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,551
Mike will consult.

482
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,233
He'll observe.

483
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,470
That's it.

484
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,914
Now, what do you got?

485
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,153
Picked up chatter. The dealer we think customed
those Herstal rounds, he's making another sale.

486
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,919
Booker Grassie.

487
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,071
Did you share any other
confidential information?

488
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,920
What? Not me.
He's the one that told me.

489
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,754
Guess my old tricks still work
a little bit.

490
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,399
You're a distraction.

491
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,031
You see that?
That's what I like, teamwork.

492
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,158
Already a beautiful relationship.

493
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,959
<i>- The video, presumed to be posted by the shooter...</i>
- Guys.

494
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,876
This is Detective Michael Lowrey.
He'll be joining us as an adviser only.

495
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,792
<i>Police have no suspects.</i>

496
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,397
<i>And the shooter is
still at lar...</i>

497
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,320
Nice to meet you all as well.

498
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,296
- Thrilled to see you've had a...
- Sweet.

499
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,518
- I am much better now. Thank you.
- I am so sorry about that.

500
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,114
You look good, Michael.

501
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,760
Look, she calls me by my whole government name,
but everybody... You can just do Mike.

502
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,240
- For sure, Mike.
- Got it, Mike.

503
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,640
Yeah, sure thing, Michael.

504
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,673
Oh, so you're that guy.

505
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,400
- Hey, there's always one.
- Yeah. Right up till there's not.

506
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,350
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's Mike Lowrey, okay?

507
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,432
- Be cool. For once.
- Let's load up!

508
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,032
Think I might be able to hang out
with you guys after all.

509
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,080
Nah, nah, that ain't the one.
We're taking The Crawdaddy.

510
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,629
Wait until you see the inside.

511
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,155
- You need any help, Gramps?
- Go ahead somewhere, boy.

512
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,800
Look at you trying
to be all cool and shit.

513
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,280
Okay, everybody is way too serious.

514
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,673
Raids are supposed to be fun.
They're like field trips with guns.

515
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,390
This is not a raid.
It's surveillance.

516
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,554
Surveillance? Right.
Meaning we're just gonna watch the crime.

517
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,712
We'll record him in the deal
and bring him in facing serious time.

518
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,153
Then we'll get him to talk and he's gonna
tell us everything that we need to know.

519
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,280
Or since he's gonna be there
and we're gonna be there,

520
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,431
I mean, we could just grab him.

521
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,034
Thank you for your input.

522
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Okay.

523
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,115
Listen up. Booker Grassie is the guy
that sold the bullets we took out of Michael.

524
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,240
Hey, look, you think you could stop
calling me Michael in front of everybody?

525
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
It's your name.

526
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Okay.

527
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Relax and clear your mind.</i>

528
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,320
<i>Use God's inspiration to bring
people peace and tranquility</i>

529
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,996
<i>by penetrating their souls
with your heart.</i>

530
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,153
We're here.

531
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,592
Excuse me, Mr. Lowrey.

532
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,434
- Just need to get past you, please. Thanks.
- Sure thing, buddy.

533
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,831
You're the tech, huh?

534
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,549
They just leave you in the van?

535
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,280
Yeah, I'm more comfortable
in here.

536
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Got it.

537
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,549
Sending in Big Barry.

538
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,074
You're not Big Barry?

539
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,830
He's our surveillance drone.

540
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,631
So you send the drone in.

541
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,509
Let's fly.

542
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,795
I guess Barry gets
to have all the fun.

543
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,678
There. Black pickup truck.
That's our H-77 Boyz.

544
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,680
Who are they?

545
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:43,117
These guys are definitely
from out of town. Trying to step up.

546
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,433
I need wide angle, whole deal.

547
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,356
Zoom in.

548
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,038
Booker's hooking them up
with a crate of 5.7-by-28s.

549
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,717
- That's Booker Grassie.
- There's our deal.

550
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Audio.

551
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:10,841
<i>Here it is.</i>

552
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,112
These will put a hole through anyone
and anything you point your gun at.

553
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,316
<i>I guarantee my product.</i>

554
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,518
- He's right there, Rita. We can grab him.
- No.

555
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm not risking the collateral damage.

556
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,391
- Let's move.
- Let's wait.

557
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,437
- You're the boss.
- Yeah, I know.

558
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,752
- That's what I just said. Okay.
- Yeah, I just confirmed it.

559
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,513
You two used to date, right?

560
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,875
- Sort of.
- Not really.

561
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
<i>Need to see the cash.</i>

562
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,516
<i>- See the cash.</i>
- Wait.

563
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,479
- Back. Go back. Right there. That guy.
- What?

564
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,358
<i>- I need to see it.</i>
- The bag is empty.

565
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,591
- There's no money in the bag. It's a rip.
<i>- If you see mine, I need to see yours.</i>

566
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,216
- They're gonna kill... It's a rip.
- Michael.

567
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,914
- We need Booker alive!
- Michael, get back here!

568
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,834
Shit. Kelly, go. Go!

569
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,320
Get me body cams.

570
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,636
<i>Michael, do not engage until we have
the rest of the team in position.</i>

571
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,677
Can we count the cash,
or what?

572
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,998
This is a nice song.
Put it louder.

573
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
Now!

574
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Move!

575
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,313
Put it down! Put it down!

576
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,560
Can you hear me?

577
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,872
I'm gonna need you to lay me
down some cover. We're coming to you.

578
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,994
All right. You wanna live, you stay with me.
Fuck with me and I'm gonna kill you.

579
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Coming at you on three.

580
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,912
Bring the truck! Grab the merch!

581
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,960
One, two, three.

582
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Shit.

583
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Shit.

584
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,591
Shit. Hey. Hey. Booker.

585
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,718
Booker, look at me.
Hey. Hey. Don't die.

586
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,476
P90 Herstals. P90 Herstals,
who's the buyer?

587
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
Oh, shit.

588
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,754
- Hey, hey. Booker. Booker.
- Michael?

589
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,435
Hey, get an ambulance in here now.
Get the paramedics.

590
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,477
- Booker. Booker.
- Michael.

591
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,916
- Don't worry about clearance. Bring them in.
- Calm down.

592
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,676
- Hey, just do what I ask you for once, please!
- He's dead!

593
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,757
Is that Diego or his twin?

594
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,240
Yeah, yeah, his twin.

595
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,630
Carmelita, no, no, no.

596
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,070
- Who this?
<i>- Yo, Marcus. It's Carver Remy.</i>

597
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,439
Look here, I'm busy, all right?
Don't waste my time, Carver. Leave me alone.

598
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,477
<i>Come on, man.
It's important.</i>

599
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,960
Keep an eye on my baby.

600
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,515
<i>- Marcus.</i>
- I'm retired.

601
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,320
Only rats I talk to are
in my basement.

602
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,110
- Carmelita shot the wrong twin!
- Oh, shit.

603
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,351
The guy who shot Mike,
he's trying to kill me.

604
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,035
- What?
<i>- I'm serious.</i>

605
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,750
<i>A guy on a black bike's been tracking me.
The one on the news. It's him.</i>

606
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,400
- Bullshit.
<i>- Marcus, would I lie to you?</i>

607
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,719
- Yes. That's why we stopped using your ass as a CI.
- I'm telling you, it's him.

608
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,237
- What do you want from me?
<i>- Protective custody. To not die.</i>

609
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,915
<i>Please, man. Use me as bait,
whatever.</i>

610
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,595
You want this guy?
He's coming for me.

611
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,356
- You talk to Mike?
<i>- I called you. Nineteenth and Miami.</i>

612
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,272
<i>Third floor.
I'll be waiting.</i>

613
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,594
What did I say? No, no.
What did I say?

614
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,514
I said consult.
I said observe. I...

615
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,240
Look at this mess. It's carnage!

616
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,994
I didn't do all this shit, Cap.
They did this to each other.

617
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,231
Wait, wait, wait.
You didn't shoot anybody?

618
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,596
- You know I shot some people, but...
- Yeah.

619
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,640
- Look, they had already started.
- What...? Jesus. Mike, you promised.

620
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,951
- No, no, I didn't promise.
- You promised.

621
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,680
- I said I could picture you on a limb, fat as hell...
- Yeah?

622
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,275
- ...with sharks and some shit.
- Right. That's a promise.

623
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,750
- You were here to watch.
- What? Yeah, and I saw.

624
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,357
All right, Cap, look.
The bag is empty, all right? No cash.

625
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,275
The guy reached up and scratched his nose.
I saw it had no weight to it.

626
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,319
- That's very impressive, sir.
- Yeah. See, I like that one.

627
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,835
If I hadn't come in,
Grassie was a dead man for sure.

628
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,357
That's a relief because your guy's
in a body bag and he sure looks dead.

629
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,909
- Cap.
- Good job, Mikey.

630
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,356
Hey, look.
Young boy, seriously.

631
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,751
Let me tell you something. You need to stay
in a child's place, all right?

632
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,230
Spare me the street knowledge, grandpa.
Nobody asked you.

633
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,280
Look, just because I fucked your mother
don't make me your grandpa, all right?

634
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,313
- That's enough. That's enough. Stop, all right?
- You got me fucked up.

635
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,720
- Old ass.
- Stand down! Let's go.

636
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,120
- You better go on.
- Let's go.

637
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,079
- I will knock your ass clean the fuck out.
- Knock me out. Hit me.

638
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,840
What am I, a nursery school teacher? Come on, let's go!

639
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,039
- Shit. I got time today.
- Cool down. Cool down. Keep walking.

640
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,077
- Excuse me, sir.
- Go ahead, man.

641
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,995
- Do you guys want a...?
- No, go. Just go ahead somewhere.

642
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
What?

643
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
What, quitter?

644
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,352
This is some sad shit.

645
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,991
- Where the hell is your ride?
- Girls took it to the spa.

646
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,914
You all right?

647
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,236
I'm fine. You all right?

648
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,960
Never felt better.

649
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,513
I mean, you could,

650
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,751
if you wanted to,

651
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,911
just do the speed limit.

652
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,279
You let a Prius pass us.

653
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,072
And what is that? What, you got
your balls tucked up in there?

654
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,076
Hey. You know what? Neither one of my balls
wanna be here with your stupid ass.

655
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,552
You brought Little Marcus
on a murder investigation?

656
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,632
We're dropping him at the spa.

657
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,712
Dropping him off at the spa?

658
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,157
Carver is scared.
He is not gonna wait, man.

659
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,515
It's on the way, Mike.

660
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,913
And what's the person that shot me want
with a snitch like Carver Remy anyway?

661
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,595
I'm taking you to find out,
motherfucker.

662
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,152
Sorry about that, Little Marcus.

663
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,277
Pop-pop shouldn't be
swearing like that.

664
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,319
Only when you're dealing
with people like Mike Lowrey,

665
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,357
you got no fucking choice.

666
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,473
Sorry. There I go again.

667
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,395
- Take the baby in.
- I ain't going in there.

668
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,995
Then you ain't gonna find out
who tried to kill you.

669
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,636
See, if I go in there, I know
who's gonna kill me. Theresa Burnett.

670
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,596
- Stop fucking around. Take your baby. Go ahead in there.
- Mike, Carver's scared.

671
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,353
He ain't gonna wait all day.

672
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
All right.

673
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
All right.

674
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,752
No. Mike! Mike!

675
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,877
Tell Marcus I'm gonna kill him!

676
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,356
Go, go!

677
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,591
- Go, go, go!
- What'd she do? What'd you do?

678
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,354
- Is she coming? She coming? Oh, shit!
- Go, go, go!

679
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,080
Mike, you known Theresa a long time.
How pissed would you say she was?

680
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,913
What you mean?
Like, one to 10?

681
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,296
- Yeah, 10 being...
- Like when I broke up with your sister?

682
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,357
No. That was me at a 10.

683
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,478
- Why would you bring that up?
- All right. I'm just trying to...

684
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,153
No, a Theresa 10 would be...

685
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,914
Me that time you spilled
the Frappuccino in my Ferrari.

686
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,313
- Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it.
- She's probably like a nine, then.

687
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,835
- A nine? Oh, sh...
- Yeah, man.

688
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,593
Oh, shit.

689
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,114
Better make it a 10.

690
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,918
- Forgot to give her the baby wipes.
- Oh, tragedy.

691
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,638
Are you stopping?

692
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,790
Dude, that was a yellow light.

693
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,873
We are in a hurry.
Come on...

694
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,432
Oh, what? You embarrassed
to be seen like this?

695
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,037
We got Mike Lowrey here!

696
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,153
Mike Lowrey in a Nissan Quest!

697
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,672
Nobody gives a shit, Mike.

698
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,150
He's... He's my Uber driver!

699
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,914
A big part of fighting crime
is being ahead of the criminals.

700
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,233
You don't have to stop for pigeons.
You just drive up to them. They'll fly away.

701
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,197
That better be a safe...

702
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,714
or a piano.

703
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,996
- This is my wife's car!
- And that's fucking Carver Remy!

704
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,754
You don't know that's Carver Remy.
That could be anybody.

705
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,594
- Cover the front door!
- I'm retired!

706
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm a civilian!

707
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,079
This is a sign.

708
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,117
It's a sign from God.

709
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,273
Oh, shoot.

710
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,033
She knows.

711
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,759
She always knows.

712
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,078
I need 315 at the Broadmoor Hotel.

713
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Fuck!

714
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,795
God, I know I asked you
to help Mike out before...

715
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,910
but he's really getting
his ass whupped.

716
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,719
Lord, give me a sign.

717
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,399
What the hell are you doing?
Mike!

718
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,920
Shit!

719
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,356
You okay?

720
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,239
I'm better than you gonna be
when Theresa see this car.

721
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,552
I had him.

722
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,074
I had him right there.

723
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,839
I don't understand, Mama.

724
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,320
<i>Armando...</i>

725
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,152
A bullet is mercy for this son of a bitch
who took your father from me.

726
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,875
<i>He needs to suffer.</i>

727
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,237
<i>Then he dies.</i>

728
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,436
<i>You understand?</i>

729
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Yes.

730
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,239
Pass it! Pass it! Thattagirl!

731
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,000
Thattagirl, Callie!

732
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,072
Make them wanna play soccer!

733
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,914
You're done, Mike.

734
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah, I know.

735
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,276
No! If she fouls you,
you foul her back!

736
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,919
- Yes!
- Yeah.

737
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,391
So there's this...
This Buddhist guy, right?

738
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,760
And, you know, mountain man, way up high,
going down this long winding road.

739
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,115
And out of nowhere,

740
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,355
this other guy's riding
a horse right toward him.

741
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,830
He's Buddhist too,
I think.

742
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,199
- Actually, I'm not sure.
- Just let them both be Buddhist, Cap.

743
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,396
Okay, fine.

744
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,794
So the guy on the horse is
riding toward our guy so fast

745
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,794
that our guy's gotta get out of the way,
so as not to be trampled by the horse.

746
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,080
And the guy gets up, all dusty, and he goes,
"Hey, where the fuck are you going?"

747
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,399
And our guy on the horse,
he says:

748
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,949
"I don't know!

749
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,430
Ask the horse!"

750
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,753
Ask the horse?

751
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,880
Exactly.

752
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:33,475
- Yes!
- Yes!

753
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,398
See that face...? That. That?

754
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,356
That's it.

755
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,079
That was my face.

756
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,800
The horse represents

757
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,760
all of our fears and traumas.

758
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,675
And it's got us running around
a hundred miles an hour,

759
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,710
to the point where we can't
even answer a simple question.

760
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,712
"Where are you going?"

761
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,431
Where are you going, Mike?

762
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,680
No, Callie!

763
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,916
Don't pass!

764
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,354
Shooters shoot!

765
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,072
Kid's got the family curse.

766
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Mike...

767
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,309
you gotta get control of your life.

768
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,357
You gotta grab the reins

769
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,150
before your horse
runs you off a cliff.

770
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,833
Come over for dinner.
Callie would love to see you.

771
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,480
I'll read you a Buddhist story.
I got a book full of them.

772
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,997
- Wait, you gonna be cooking again?
- Hell, yeah.

773
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,232
- All right, all right. We'll order pizza.
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

774
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Bingo.

775
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,994
- Cap!
- I don't know! I don't know! Go, go, go!

776
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Get him.

777
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,396
I can help. What does he need?

778
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Shoot.

779
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,473
- Through the bitch.
- Move.

780
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,936
- Move. Get behind the car.
- No. I can help.

781
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,076
Move! Get behind the car!

782
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,120
What's wrong with you, man?

783
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,558
You had that shot.

784
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,875
No innocents.

785
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,919
You crazy, man, you know that?

786
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,549
Three-fifteen. Shots fired.
Officer down.

787
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,313
Jose Marti Park.

788
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,036
We need Air One on a three.
This is Detective Mike Lowrey.

789
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,313
The captain is down.

790
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,880
The captain is down.

791
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,670
Ready! Aim! Fire!

792
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:32,560
Ready! Aim! Fire!

793
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,234
You were right, man.

794
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,073
You said if I went out there,
I was gonna get somebody killed.

795
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,869
One last time?

796
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,000
One last time.

797
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,549
Mama, they're all gone.
It's time?

798
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,552
<i>Yes, kill him.</i>

799
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,157
<i>But before you do it, look in his eyes
and tell him something for me.</i>

800
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,316
What, Mama?

801
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,434
I ran a suspicious financial report on Booker.
All his LLC fronts have the same accountant.

802
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,274
Picante Jenkins, CPA.

803
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,750
Yep. You don't meet
too many Picantes.

804
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,193
- So we just gonna do a knock-and-talk?
- Yeah.

805
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,515
- What the hell is all that?
- What you talking about?

806
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,479
Mike, you don't need
a grenade launcher.

807
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,313
Yeah, but I want one.

808
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,437
He's an accountant, Mike.

809
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,992
- Look, we're not going in there like that.
- Like what?

810
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,879
Hey, look, all our lives,
we've been bad boys, all right?

811
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,713
Now it's time to be good men.

812
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,270
Who in the hell
wanna sing that song?

813
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,036
<i>Good men, good men
What you gonna do?</i>

814
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,792
Well, maybe if you sang the song
like you meant it, it'd catch on.

815
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,880
Nah.

816
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,633
Knock and talk.

817
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,200
Yeah. Knock, knock.

818
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,680
- Mike! Mike! Mike!
- Miami PD! Get down!

819
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,796
- Mike! Mike!
- Get down!

820
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,634
- What is happening?
- Mike! What happened to knock and talk?

821
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,794
- Hey, you broke my door. You broke my door!
- Sir, sorry about the door, okay?

822
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,715
- A little Gorilla Glue will make that just fine.
- Hey, where's your warrant?

823
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,237
I need you on your knees with your hands
behind your head right now!

824
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,113
Sir, if you keep moving,
I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

825
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,032
- No, he's not.
- Yes, I am!

826
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,716
Mike, the man is an accountant.
We just need to talk to him.

827
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,593
So you wanna have a conversation

828
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,833
- with a coked-out orange mountain?
- Here's the latest figures.

829
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,560
Look, let me handle this, okay?
Just back up.

830
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,390
I'm gonna penetrate
this man's soul with my heart.

831
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,520
What?

832
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,630
Yeah.

833
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,871
Watch and learn.

834
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,711
Hey! Hey, ass licker.
I'm gonna fast-food fist-fuck you.

835
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,156
Sir, that's just nasty.

836
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,832
- Now, I recognize that this is a difficult situation.
- Don't come over here.

837
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,630
- Don't go over there.
- We just need your client's receipts.

838
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,155
- What?
- Booker Grassie.

839
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,356
Any record of...?

840
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,917
Hey. How deep you think
you got in his soul?

841
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,558
- Sometime you gotta suffer for what is right.
- Don't you turn that other cheek.

842
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,080
- Get off me!
- All right.

843
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,798
Now, sir, I realize
that you're scared.

844
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,271
Hell, we all scared.
You know, sometimes fear just...

845
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,760
So, what you thinking?

846
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,830
I think you should
handle this one.

847
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,036
Yeah, me too.

848
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Hey!

849
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,600
MLK just tapped out.
You got Brother Malcolm now.

850
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,558
We can handle this
by any means necessary.

851
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,871
Hey, I recognize you.
You're that cop that got shot.

852
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,236
Bad year you're having,
Butterscotch.

853
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,155
If you didn't have that gun
and badge, I'd fucking eat you.

854
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,880
This the only thing that's keeping you
from eating me, huh?

855
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Yeah.

856
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,715
Bring it, big boy.

857
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,832
- Left line clear!
- Cuff him.

858
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,516
What the hell are y'all doing here?

859
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,829
I called them.

860
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
What?

861
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,879
What happened to bad boys
one last time?

862
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,673
This is one last time.

863
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,150
But this here's the remix, Mike.

864
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,674
We work with AMMO now.

865
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,599
That's that shit, okay?

866
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,315
You got three seconds
before I bite it off.

867
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,040
Get your damn finger out my face.

868
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,876
So tell us. Judge, prosecutor,
criminal informant, the captain, and you.

869
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,431
- Who do you all have in common?
- Hundreds of investigations, operations...

870
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,592
Eight hundred and forty-seven cases
in the nexus of all the victims.

871
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,037
- Well, who up there wants to kill you?
- Hell, who doesn't?

872
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,880
- All right.
- That just the criminals that we're looking at.

873
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,670
I don't trust a person that don't wanna kill him.
Hell, put my name up there.

874
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,037
- Thanks. We got it. We appreciate it.
- What you get out of the accountant?

875
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,237
- His records are a mess.
- Surprising.

876
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,074
But I did manage to get
into his Keychain.

877
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,753
- So?
- All of his social.

878
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
Boom.

879
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,680
A lot of dick pics
but not so many clues.

880
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,195
- Facial rec for anyone in our system.
- On it.

881
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,158
It's three days
before I got hit.

882
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,280
Hey, go back to that last shot.
The chain.

883
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,989
Yeah, zoom in.

884
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,510
- Zway Lo.
- Zway Lo.

885
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,558
Who's Zway Lo?

886
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,110
Lorenzo Rodriguez.
Goes by Zway Lo.

887
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,910
Used to coach him in peewee hoops
before he went for that thug shit.

888
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,635
Great player, but I had to bench him
during the championship.

889
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,110
You benched a 10-year-old
in the championship game?

890
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,396
Yeah. Little fucker called me
a dickhead.

891
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,437
- Did y'all win at least?
- Hell, no.

892
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,912
He was our star player.
We lost by 40, but I made my point.

893
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,992
Okay, there's no "I" in "team."

894
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,436
- There is one in "dickhead" though.
- Man, shut up.

895
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,672
Look, Zway Lo's into drugs,
weapons.

896
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,479
He's one of Taglin's lieutenants.

897
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,275
Taglin was found dead
the same night Mike got shot.

898
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,756
I guess he's someone else's
lieutenant now.

899
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,194
Lorenzo Rodriguez.

900
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,472
No mortgage,
not even a bank account.

901
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,711
But it is his birthday tomorrow.

902
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,077
If he's celebrating,
there's three spots for a cat like that.

903
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,232
Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion.

904
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,073
Can you get into their club records?

905
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,520
Ice 45 should up their cyber security.

906
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,477
Okay. Ice 45.

907
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,510
Ditto. Zillion.

908
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,119
There. Rodriguez.

909
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,919
- Bam.
- The party's tonight.

910
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,357
Zillion it is.

911
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,837
All right, we meet at the club at 2300, UC,
so wear your Sunday best.

912
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,871
This is a grab. We're in. We're out.
No bodies. This raid is strictly nonlethal.

913
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,519
Nonlethal.

914
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,035
Has anyone informed the bad guys?

915
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,992
ACLU rounds.
Rubber.

916
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,716
Trust me, you'll enjoy them.
You get to shoot as much as you want.

917
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,792
<i>Bad boys, bad boys</i>

918
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,880
Hell, no.

919
01:07:07,881 --> 01:07:10,475
<i>Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when we come...?</i>

920
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,119
Hey, hey, hey!

921
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,919
- No, no.
- No! No!

922
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,640
Never. Y'all will
never do that again.

923
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,549
Yeah, and you fucking up the lyrics,
which take a long time to learn.

924
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,875
- Don't do that.
- All right.

925
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,400
- No, no. Don't do that.
- Seriously.

926
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,480
- Okay.
- Sorry, sorry.

927
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,440
Shit.

928
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,637
- Won't happen again.
- Get your own damn song.

929
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,154
Can you believe that shit?

930
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,754
Dumbass.

931
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,160
Whatever, man.

932
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,879
Miss me with that bullshit.

933
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
I got this.

934
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,155
Hello there, ladies.
Georgio in there tonight?

935
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,954
- No idea who that is, sir.
- The line's in the back.

936
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,717
Nicole! Paige!

937
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,553
Hey!

938
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,632
- Hey!
- You guys look so good.

939
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

940
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,274
- So beautiful. Oh, my God.
- You too.

941
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,559
That's my Uncle Michael,
and that's his pal, Uncle Marcus.

942
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,553
You mind if they come in?
He just got divorced.

943
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,360
- Oh, that is so sad.
- Yeah.

944
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,954
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Come on.

945
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,520
- Hell, no.
- Come on, kids. Let's go.

946
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,640
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.

947
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,518
- Oh, no.
- No, yeah.

948
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,080
- It's real.
- No, not at all.

949
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,640
- Yeah.
- No, sir.

950
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,720
Yeah.

951
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,756
Yeah.

952
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,837
Kelly, what's the target QTH?

953
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,673
<i>Second level. VIP platform.</i>

954
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,399
<i>- I have eyes on.</i>
- Up top.

955
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,640
Hi, baby.

956
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,040
Target confirmed.

957
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,434
<i>Platform is one way in,
one way out.</i>

958
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,159
<i>We got him cornered.</i>

959
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,153
Man on his two-side has a 55, hot.

960
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,318
Stay with the A-plan. Kelly,
you're on Zway Lo's bodyguard.

961
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,400
<i>Copy.</i>

962
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,315
Mike, how you think she DJ like that?

963
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,320
She must got some strong ass muscles.

964
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,435
Look, I'm gonna be honest
with you, Mike.

965
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,194
I ain't had sex in a long time.

966
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,352
Yeah, too long. Too long.
I be thinking of shit.

967
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,557
- Crazy shit, Mike.
- Marcus.

968
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,953
- I feel like I'm locked up since...
- Hey, you know they can hear you?

969
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,158
It's too loud. They can't hear us.
They can't hear us.

970
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,511
Look, look, sometime I go to
the Internet,

971
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,956
<i>and I see some weird shit
on there.</i>

972
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,599
<i>- I saw a man put his...
- Marcus.</i>

973
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,909
Marcus.

974
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
What?

975
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,669
We can hear you.

976
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,310
That's a little jokey joke.
Y'all didn't hear that, did you?

977
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,390
- In position.
<i>- Setting up.</i>

978
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,597
<i>Mike, Marcus,
meet you at the top.</i>

979
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,396
<i>Mike and Marcus moving,
stairs right.</i>

980
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,592
<i>Rita on the move,
stairs left.</i>

981
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,551
- Everybody in position?
- Set.

982
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,199
<i>- Set.</i>
- Set.

983
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,877
<i>That dress is incredible, girl.</i>

984
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,952
- You got style.
- Oh, hi.

985
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,394
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

986
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,472
Stand by. Stand by. Stand by.

987
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,314
<i>I can't. I'm here
with my girlfriends.</i>

988
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,074
They can come too, baby.

989
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,875
I can't tonight.

990
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,074
Knee him in his balls,
and let's go.

991
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,311
- From T√©touan.
- From T√©touan.

992
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,312
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, baby.

993
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,915
Why'd she wear that dress?
That is not a undercover dress.

994
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,357
You should've wore something...
undercover.

995
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,394
Happy birthday.

996
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,599
Yo, yo, yo! Everybody,
let's make some noise!

997
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,877
We got a special guest
in the house!

998
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,954
It's his birthday! Let's wish him
a birthday on one! Three, two, one.

999
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,077
Happy birthday!

1000
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,470
We love you, Zway Lo!

1001
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,559
Hey! Yeah!

1002
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,519
<i>- Zway Lo! Zway Lo!</i>
- Top of the world, baby!

1003
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,796
<i>- Zway Lo! Zway Lo!</i>
- Happy birthday, dickhead.

1004
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,880
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1005
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,118
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1006
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,676
- Yeah.
- You going to jail today, motherfucker.

1007
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,558
When I say "criminal,
"you say "jail."

1008
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,360
- Criminal.
- Jail.

1009
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,920
Miami PD! Freeze.

1010
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,480
- Damn!
- Damn!

1011
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,519
I told you he was an athlete.

1012
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,719
- We gotta jump.
- I'm not jumping.

1013
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,638
- He's getting away! Jump now!
- Shit!

1014
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,755
Zway Lo!

1015
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,949
Get out of the way!

1016
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,350
I need this. I need it.
Excuse me, sir.

1017
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,675
- What you doing?
- Excuse me.

1018
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,479
- Hey, hold on!
- Official police business.

1019
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,240
- Hey, that's my car!
- This is the police.

1020
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Back up!

1021
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,275
- What the fuck?
- Come on!

1022
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,792
It is of no advantage for me to jump off
of the fucking thing if you're gonna take the stairs!

1023
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,712
I told your ass I wasn't jumping!

1024
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,553
<i>Zway Lo just turned left
on 2nd Ave.</i>

1025
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,560
Shit!

1026
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,720
- Putting your seat belt on?
- Yeah.

1027
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,680
- That's how we do it now?
- You're damn right.

1028
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,000
- Number one's on my ass!
<i>- Crossing 395 into Overtown.</i>

1029
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,231
Whoa, Mike. Overtown's a no-go.

1030
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,710
<i>Zway got people here.
Dangerous people.</i>

1031
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,314
We're dangerous people.

1032
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,080
Shit, whoa!

1033
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,280
Damn Nerf gun,
rubber bullet bullshit.

1034
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,915
They shooting slugs,
we firing gummy bears.

1035
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,630
Mike, pull over for a minute.
I need to tell you something.

1036
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,995
- Pull over?
- Yeah.

1037
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,392
- One second. Let me see if Zway will pull over. Zway Lo!
- Yeah. Yeah.

1038
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,633
Marcus needs to pull over for a second!
Hey, can we get a time-out?

1039
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,394
- Damn it, Mike, I need to tell you something!
- What?

1040
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,073
I made a promise to God.

1041
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,594
- To who?
- To God.

1042
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,238
What the hell are you talking about?

1043
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,916
Look, I told the Lord that
if you made it through

1044
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,071
that I would make no more violence.

1045
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,870
He definitely knew you was bullshitting
with that. Violence is what we do.

1046
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,119
It's about your soul, Mike.

1047
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,840
Our job is to protect and serve.

1048
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,152
You're damn right. I'm about
to serve this bitch right now.

1049
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,871
- Oh, shit! What...?
- Oh, shit.

1050
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,599
Oh, look at that!

1051
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,114
Damn!

1052
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,479
That is some Elephant Man shit right there.
Yo, you see that?

1053
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,836
- Yeah, I see it.
- Hey, stop it.

1054
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,673
- It's calling me, Mike.
- What?

1055
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,559
- Leave it... Stop it.
- I can't help it, but it's calling me.

1056
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,439
Stop. What the hell is wrong
with you? Just leave it alone.

1057
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,035
Yo, leave it alone.
Leave... Marcus.

1058
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,237
- You're gonna pop that shit, man.
- That shit nasty!

1059
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,397
- Then leave it alone.
- Oh, shit.

1060
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,160
Damn.

1061
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,474
- Just leave it alone! Let's...
- No, one more time. One more again.

1062
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,960
Overtown is waking up.
Let's go.

1063
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,274
<i>- AMMO, where you at?</i>
- Got jammed up. Hitting Overtown now.

1064
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,714
Gear up.

1065
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,956
Come on.

1066
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,635
Fuck!

1067
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,273
We got your man!

1068
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,670
- Shit!
- I'll kill his ass!

1069
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,554
Oh, shit!

1070
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,554
Stop it!
Wake up, Zway Lo!

1071
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:59,077
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake your ass up!

1072
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,395
Coach Burnett?

1073
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,356
Dickhead.

1074
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,232
Still think I'm a dickhead?

1075
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,837
- Zway Lo, who wants to kill me?
- Shit, everybody wanna kill you.

1076
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,314
Yeah, I told you, Mike.

1077
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,392
Forget about me!
Kill them both!

1078
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,480
What's he saying?

1079
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:17,399
Kill them both!

1080
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,834
What's he saying?

1081
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,832
- Y'all both dying tonight.
- Coming up, Marcus.

1082
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,070
Oh, shit.

1083
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,792
Thank you, God!

1084
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,992
Why'd you let him get away?!

1085
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,914
Lay suppression fire!

1086
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,957
- Oh, shit!
- Get in!

1087
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,794
- There's a pit bull!
- Hey, come on!

1088
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,677
Wanna get bit, you wanna get shot?

1089
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,235
Come on! Let's go!

1090
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,039
- Oh, shit.
- What you got?

1091
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,113
It's like an angry
white man's basement in here.

1092
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,480
- Shit, a fucking grenade.
- Pull it.

1093
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,870
- Pull it!
- This ain't fucking Vietnam!

1094
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,560
- Hang on to it, then.
- Damn you, Mike!

1095
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,995
Oh, shit!

1096
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,592
Come on, man!
What else you got?

1097
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh, yeah!

1098
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,795
Shoot that shit!

1099
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,351
No, no, Mike! I made a promise
to God! No more violence.

1100
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,314
- Who do you think sent you that weapon?
- I don't know!

1101
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,959
That is God's gun!

1102
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,191
- It is?!
- Sent to you in your time of need.

1103
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,069
- Well, shit! I do need it right now!
- Yes. You are a vessel for the Lord's work.

1104
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,197
- Yeah, I'm a vessel.
- Like David and Goliath.

1105
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,354
- Yeah, David with the slingshot.
- Yes! That is your slingshot!

1106
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,080
- Yeah!
- To smite thine enemies!

1107
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,040
- You know what? Bad boys of the Bible, baby!
- Exactly!

1108
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,033
- Amen? Amen?
- Amen! Amen!

1109
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,555
- Shit!
- Where are your glasses?

1110
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,712
- I don't need no damn glasses!
- You ain't hitting shit!

1111
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,160
Let's go!

1112
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,240
Shit!

1113
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,320
Get that ATV!
I got the six!

1114
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,600
Yes!

1115
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
No!

1116
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,791
Mike! Mike! Mike!
What the hell you doing?!

1117
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,751
Lord, I don't wanna die this way!

1118
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,799
- Mike!
- Oh, shit!

1119
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,676
- My bad, my bad.
- Damn right, that's your bad!

1120
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,350
Oh, shit.

1121
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,320
Oh, shit!

1122
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,080
Oh, shit!

1123
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,476
Mike! Mike!

1124
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,760
Move!

1125
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,593
Get out of the fucking way!

1126
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,391
Hey, Dorn. I need you.

1127
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,953
Hey, hey, look.

1128
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,714
I been there before. Many times.

1129
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,200
It's gonna be all right.

1130
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,715
That's Zway Lo's phone.
Can you break it?

1131
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,510
- Yeah. What am I looking for?
- Who he's talking to. Call logs.

1132
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,474
And I need you to hurry up
just a little bit.

1133
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,432
Okay, but I'm gonna have to go
on the dark side.

1134
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,318
All right.
You good with that?

1135
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,920
Yeah.

1136
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:10,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

1137
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,829
Dorn, he's a big guy.

1138
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,276
- How'd he get so good at this stuff?
- What stuff?

1139
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,760
Tech shit.

1140
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,991
- He looks like a killer.
- Is.

1141
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,480
Used to be a bouncer.

1142
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,910
Guy one night was getting
physical with a woman...

1143
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,196
Yeah, big man lost it. Hit him.

1144
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,751
- Bastard dropped dead.
- Avoided the fight ever since.

1145
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,840
Here we go.

1146
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,118
Give me the last two months.

1147
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,120
Shit.

1148
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:42,349
Mexico.

1149
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,154
What are you after here?

1150
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,439
All right. To each one of those numbers,
I need you to text the phrase:

1151
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,640
Done.

1152
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,594
All right. I got it.
Thank you.

1153
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,120
- You sure?
- I got it. Go.

1154
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,910
We're shut down.

1155
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,673
- What?
- What do you mean?

1156
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,989
AMMO's done.

1157
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,040
I'm sorry.

1158
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,196
Look, everything's gonna be all right.
Trust me on this, okay?

1159
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,033
Everything's gonna be all right.

1160
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,270
Mike.

1161
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,676
You all right?

1162
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,198
I think he's my son.

1163
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,396
What?

1164
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,790
Twenty-four years ago,
before we partnered up...

1165
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,480
Captain Howard pulled me out
of the academy.

1166
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,870
Nobody knew who I was.

1167
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,431
He sent me in undercover
with the Aretas cartel.

1168
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,275
<i>Sorenson.</i>

1169
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,635
<i>Weber.</i>

1170
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,393
<i>Vargas. Carver.</i>

1171
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,552
All of the victims were on that case.

1172
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,756
This is revenge.

1173
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:27,471
- Yeah, Mike, but you weren't on that case.
- My name wasn't on it.

1174
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,199
That's how deep I was.

1175
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,317
I was Ricky Rollins.

1176
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,278
Benito Aretas.

1177
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,795
He's dead, Mike. He ain't after you.

1178
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,513
Not him.

1179
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,600
His wife.

1180
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,470
Isabel.

1181
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,399
I was her driver.

1182
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:49,315
We connected so... deep.

1183
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,599
We talked about everything.
She showed me the whole game.

1184
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,720
How to walk it, how to talk it,
put clothes on it.

1185
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,872
She made Mike Lowrey.

1186
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,595
We fell in love.

1187
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,320
- Are you telling me the one time that you...?
- Isabel Aretas.

1188
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,754
The one time.

1189
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,593
Takedown was coming.
DEA, ATF, everybody.

1190
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,356
And I was gonna ghost
the whole operation.

1191
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,000
Me and Isabel were gonna run away
with each other.

1192
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,833
What made you change your mind?

1193
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,750
They call her <i>La Bruja.</i>

1194
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,910
The Witch.

1195
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,709
<i>She is into some dark shit.</i>

1196
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,120
<i>Santa Muerte.</i>

1197
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,471
That woman...

1198
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,349
was a stone-cold killer.

1199
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:48,112
<i>So I had to put the woman I love behind bars
for the rest of her life.</i>

1200
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,879
Chose the badge, and I've been
choosing it ever since.

1201
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,511
Mike, you fucked a married witch?

1202
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,076
So all the shit I just said,
and that was your takeaway?

1203
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,992
No, it's just a lot to digest.

1204
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,390
You think you know somebody and...

1205
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,837
Hell, now it explains
why you dress like a drug dealer.

1206
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,753
- So you wanna hear this shit or you don't?
- Sorry.

1207
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,959
But you don't know that's your son, Mike.
You don't know who that witch was fucking.

1208
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,829
Benito Aretas couldn't have kids.

1209
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:30,709
Isabel gave birth in prison,
eight months after her arrest.

1210
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,555
He said that to me before
I jumped from the chopper.

1211
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,515
<i>Me and Isabel made that up.</i>

1212
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,832
<i>It's not even real Spanish.
It's some shit we said to each other.</i>

1213
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,953
<i>It meant like,
"We'll be together until we burn."</i>

1214
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,316
The traitor is coming.

1215
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,312
Get prepared.

1216
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,629
We will.

1217
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,513
Let's go!

1218
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,158
- Nah, Mike.
- Marcus, he's the right age.

1219
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,154
<i>He's crazy like me. He's ruthless like me.
He's fearless like me.</i>

1220
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,311
He's the fucked-up me.

1221
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,033
No, Mike.

1222
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,634
You the fucked-up you.

1223
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,395
You jumping to conclusions.
All right?

1224
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,949
Shit's gonna work itself out.
You gotta trust that.

1225
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,640
Yeah...

1226
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,720
You're right.

1227
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,596
Oh, man.

1228
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,549
I love you, man.

1229
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,794
I love you, man.

1230
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,478
- I gotta go. All right?
- Mike.

1231
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,840
Mike.

1232
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,480
Let me get past you there, sir.
Sorry there. Excuse me.

1233
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,835
Excuse me.

1234
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,714
That's the right spot
for me right there.

1235
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,114
Excuse me, sir.

1236
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,839
Seat right there.

1237
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,516
Let me get by you. Watch your toes.
Watch your toes there.

1238
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,557
It's all right.
There you go.

1239
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,116
No, Marcus.

1240
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,837
I'm not letting you go on
a suicide mission alone, Mike.

1241
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,559
This is on me.

1242
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,752
I'm not letting anybody else get killed
dealing with my shit.

1243
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,116
Mike, she's a <i>bruja.</i>

1244
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,113
She'll make your eyes melt
into your stupid-ass head.

1245
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,192
She'll make your dick fall off.

1246
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,840
I meant penis. You should be minding
your own business anyway.

1247
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,600
Marcus, please go home.

1248
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,839
We fly together. We die together.

1249
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,559
- What?
- Oh, no.

1250
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,359
That's just something we say.

1251
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,113
It's all good. It ain't...

1252
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,476
I can see how that got
y'all a little...

1253
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,631
Where y'all from? Where you from?

1254
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,711
So, what you gonna do when you see him?
You really gonna put your son behind bars?

1255
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,675
No. I'm gonna kill him.

1256
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,350
Kill him? You really gonna
kill your own son, Mike?

1257
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,272
I'm gonna put him
in a fucking bag.

1258
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,834
- You mind if we switch seats?
- Yeah, please.

1259
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,920
Excuse me.

1260
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,393
You realize you will
go to hell?

1261
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,996
- I don't believe in hell, Marcus.
- Well, it believes in you.

1262
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,912
I mean, killing your own son.

1263
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,994
Brother, that's a darkness
that swallows you whole.

1264
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,676
Well, maybe I already been swallowed.

1265
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,594
I died, remember?

1266
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,559
I'm ending this shit, man.

1267
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,030
I should have known
he was your son.

1268
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,353
Because the way
he whupped your ass, Mike.

1269
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,990
That was a ass-whupping straight
from thy own loins.

1270
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,311
A supernatural ass-whupping.

1271
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,110
Can I be the godfather?

1272
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,556
- You know what you can be, Marcus?
- What?

1273
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,869
Quiet.

1274
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,633
- Oh, I should be quiet?
- Yeah.

1275
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,037
All right, you just had
a warlock baby with <i>La Bruja,</i>

1276
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,158
who's trying to kill your ass,
probably mine too,

1277
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,916
sucking our blood and all of that shit,
but I should be quiet.

1278
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,037
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, Mike.

1279
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,071
How you fuck a witch
without a condom?

1280
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,515
You wrap that shit up, man.

1281
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,513
- Hey, my man. We need to change seats.
- Yep. Okay.

1282
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,836
Mike <i>y</i> Marcus.

1283
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,078
This makes us even for Miami.

1284
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,630
Yo, we hot.

1285
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,073
- You called them again.
- Hey, Rita called me.

1286
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,593
- What's up, fellas?
- Hey.

1287
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,194
Hey. Hey.

1288
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,477
I feel better when they're here.

1289
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,789
Yeah, me too.

1290
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,717
- Where'd you get all the toys?
- DEA station in Cuernavaca.

1291
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,554
We capture her,
they take the credit.

1292
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,712
Get ourselves killed,
they've got nothing to do with it.

1293
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,632
All eyes on me.

1294
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:44,317
I'm the bait. We meet at Hidalgo Palace.
It's an old hotel outside the city.

1295
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,154
I'll keep her talking
till you guys spot the shooter.

1296
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,712
- What if she just shoots you?
- Nah, she's gonna wanna talk.

1297
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,634
We... have history.

1298
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,680
Okay. Snatch and grab. We get them,
and we're on a plane to the States by dawn.

1299
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,915
Dorn, get a floor-plan satellite image.

1300
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,199
We'll have eyes on the outside and...

1301
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,439
on the inside.

1302
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,514
Hey. Nobody touches the shooter.
He's mine.

1303
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,114
Yes, he is.

1304
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,231
You coloring a little bit outside
the lines today, huh?

1305
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:36,880
Don't die.

1306
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,077
You make sure we both come home.

1307
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,152
Still no identifiable threats.
Monitoring all channels inside.

1308
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,080
Jamming everything outside, in case
they're running countersurveillance.

1309
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,594
There's no way she's here alone.

1310
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,400
It's the cartel.
She's gonna have serious backup.

1311
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,113
Marcus is moving towards the back.

1312
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,590
Marcus, we're covering
your position from the sky.

1313
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,512
Still nothing.

1314
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,920
Moving in closer.

1315
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,720
Hola, Ricky.

1316
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,792
Or should I call you Mike?

1317
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,234
Hola, Isabel.

1318
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,479
Not very thorough.

1319
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,673
There was a time when touching me
would have melted you.

1320
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,797
I'm gonna kill her myself.

1321
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Keep it.

1322
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,160
Where is he?

1323
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,434
<i>This used to be our place.</i>

1324
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,437
I wanted you dead...

1325
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,795
but you survived.

1326
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,920
Perhaps I made you too strong.

1327
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Or perhaps...

1328
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,071
Santa Muerte is
telling us something.

1329
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,960
We were fated
to meet one more time.

1330
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,591
This is some real telenovela shit.

1331
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,920
I've taken care of that.

1332
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,160
Shit.

1333
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,879
I just lost all comms.

1334
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,395
- Fuck. AMMO?
- Marcus, come in.

1335
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,870
- Shit.
- They're jamming us.

1336
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,872
- They know that we're here.
- This is fucked.

1337
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,317
- I can't get back in.
- Still got Baby Barry on an outside frequency.

1338
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,513
It's just us now.

1339
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,915
Why didn't you tell me
I had a son?

1340
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,474
What would you have done?

1341
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,480
Taken care of him.

1342
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,796
Like you took care of me?

1343
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,438
It was gonna be a surprise.

1344
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,994
After we ran away.

1345
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,950
I'm seeing tactical movement. I've got
20 to 30 threats forming a perimeter.

1346
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,230
We gotta go.

1347
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,959
- Alt points of entry?
- Here.

1348
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,791
That cold airflow could be
a laundry exhaust.

1349
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,912
How could you do this to our son?

1350
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,275
My son.

1351
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,680
Who does he think I am?

1352
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,393
Exactly who you are:

1353
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,349
The coward, the traitor...

1354
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,520
Don't do this.

1355
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,313
Keep it moving, detective.

1356
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,316
You see that?

1357
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,190
Drop it.

1358
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,914
Let's go!

1359
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,476
What you gonna do?

1360
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,756
No <i>"el suego."</i>
That means fire, right?

1361
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,479
No, no <i>"cate."</i>

1362
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,313
You and this man need to talk.

1363
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,437
- It's some life-changing shit.
- Shut the fuck up.

1364
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,797
- Easy on the barrel! Easy! No. Mike.
- Marcus, relax.

1365
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:31,191
It's lack of communication
that got this shit fucked up.

1366
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,591
He needs to tell you something. You ain't
gonna like it, but you need to hear it.

1367
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,349
Oh, shit!

1368
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,476
Yo, Mike, they're moving up
to the chopper!

1369
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,840
Marcus!

1370
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,074
- Put your glasses on!
- What the hell was that?

1371
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,833
That was a bad throw!

1372
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,753
Yo, Mike, careful!

1373
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,670
- You were right about the glasses.
- I been telling your ass that shit for years.

1374
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,832
Shit, this is like HD!

1375
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,314
Go! Go! Go!

1376
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,077
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1377
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,593
Go! Go, go, go!

1378
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,519
Hey, Isabel and the shooter
went up the stairs.

1379
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,193
Can you cover us?

1380
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,636
- Kelly! Flank right!
- Copy!

1381
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:33,280
- Rafe, pan left! Push!
- Copy that!

1382
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,996
- Dorn, follow Rafe!
- Yup!

1383
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,594
Hey, big man.

1384
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,071
I'm gonna need you to hurt some people.
I'll pay for the therapy, all right?

1385
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,557
I'm gonna need it. Seriously.

1386
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,756
Yeah, I got you.

1387
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,399
I'll hold the middle...

1388
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,995
- and you push hard for the stairs.
- Push hard for the stairs.

1389
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,230
Yeah.

1390
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,676
Hey. It's good shit, lieutenant.

1391
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,399
You too, detective.

1392
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,472
You ain't such a dumbass after all.

1393
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,596
On me!

1394
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Go!

1395
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,754
Transition!

1396
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,040
Go!

1397
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,356
Shit.

1398
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,276
- Shoot!
- Take them both!

1399
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,510
Right there, right there!

1400
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,074
Where the hell they getting
all these helicopters?

1401
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,560
Mike!

1402
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,717
- Take out the pilot!
- Take out the rotor!

1403
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,677
- What are you aiming at?!
- The pilot!

1404
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,915
Aim at the rotor!
If you shoot the pilot...

1405
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,114
Got him!

1406
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,077
Oh, shit!

1407
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,792
Shit. You got a fucked-up family,
Mike.

1408
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,120
The building's coming down!
We gotta move!

1409
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,919
Mike! Marcus!

1410
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,400
Shit.

1411
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,513
On your knees, Isabel. Get down.

1412
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,630
Mike!

1413
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,791
Let that be a lesson
to your witch ass.

1414
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:29,120
Armando...

1415
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,720
you're my son.

1416
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:39,640
You're my son.

1417
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,635
I don't wanna fight.

1418
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,040
Stay down.

1419
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,354
I said, stay down.

1420
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,794
I didn't know.

1421
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,794
If I had known...

1422
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,840
Mike, what are you doing?

1423
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:39,876
I'm trying to penetrate his soul...

1424
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,758
with my heart.

1425
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,115
No.

1426
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,714
No, Mike, no.

1427
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,598
I was going through something.

1428
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,716
Who are you?

1429
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,356
I told you.

1430
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,036
Liar.

1431
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,030
Last chance.

1432
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,516
Who are you?

1433
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,795
Ask your mother.

1434
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,680
Is it true what he says?

1435
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,200
It doesn't matter.
He's nothing to you.

1436
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,835
Hey, y'all see
all this <i>fuego?</i>

1437
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:44,957
Can we take this shit outside?

1438
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,076
Who is he?

1439
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,317
- Tell him!
- Tell him, mama.

1440
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,080
Is he my father?

1441
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,151
Is he my father?!

1442
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,240
Yes.

1443
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,750
Kill him.

1444
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,960
- No, no, wait, wait, wait...
- Shit.

1445
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,876
Lay down. Down. Down.

1446
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,713
Oh, shit.

1447
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,554
Mike, we gotta go.

1448
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,030
Mike! Gotta move! Now!

1449
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,520
Mike! We gotta go!

1450
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:13,958
Hold me! Hold me!

1451
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,799
Oh, shit!

1452
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:20,519
Mike! Don't let me go!
Don't let me go! Oh, shit!

1453
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,190
Hold on. I got you.

1454
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,198
Mike! I can't get to you!

1455
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,154
I can't hold on.

1456
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:32,074
Pull me up! Mike,
I don't wanna die this way!

1457
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,674
Oh, Mike, I'm slipping.

1458
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,600
Come on!

1459
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,635
Hurry!
I can feel my ass cooking!

1460
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,680
Come on.

1461
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,073
Let's go! We gotta move!

1462
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:11,200
Gunshot wound, upper chest!
We need medical!

1463
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,033
- En route!
- All right.

1464
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,873
- It's okay, I got him.
- Put him down.

1465
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,997
- We need a trauma dressing.
- Right.

1466
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,720
Relax.

1467
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,631
I can't promise you
it's gonna be all good...

1468
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,473
after all the stuff
you've done, but...

1469
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:37,275
I can promise you
I'm gonna be there, all right?

1470
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,834
Hey.

1471
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,633
I'm your Uncle Marcus.

1472
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,679
But we'll talk about that later.

1473
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,639
Yeah, yeah.

1474
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,074
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1475
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,911
- Hey.
- Hey.

1476
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,278
There we go.

1477
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,316
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

1478
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,320
You guys.

1479
01:54:19,321 --> 01:54:20,239
- There it is.
- Yes.

1480
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,074
- Now it's time to raise your glasses...
- Yes.

1481
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,629
- to our new captain.
- To our new captain.

1482
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,470
- Hey, my mom says hey.
- You're not gonna let me live that down.

1483
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:33,916
Oh, and, guys,
I got some news for you.

1484
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,354
I just started therapy,

1485
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:39,673
and my therapist thought it'd be super beneficial
if maybe we could hit up a group sesh together.

1486
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,160
- It's super sick.
- Oh, for sure.

1487
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:43,152
- Definitely.
- Yeah, we will be there.

1488
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,280
- Marcus, let me holler at you for a second.
- Yeah.

1489
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,034
Let me think about it.

1490
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,880
- He want us to go to therapy.
- Yeah, I'm not going.

1491
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,360
I'm not going.

1492
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:56,910
Hey, man, look...

1493
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:01,431
we don't say this kind of shit
to each other, man, but just...

1494
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,756
thank you.

1495
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,233
Mike, you don't have to thank me.

1496
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,356
If you wanna retire,

1497
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:14,150
just know that I am not
gonna try to stop you.

1498
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,435
You earned it.

1499
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,230
And I will support you 100,
no matter what.

1500
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:21,073
But you're forgetting one thing.

1501
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,560
We said for life.

1502
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,600
For life, baby.

1503
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,554
- There's my nephew.
- Yes.

1504
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,518
- Hey.
- Little Marcus just woke up.

1505
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,478
Okay, first things first.

1506
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,880
Little surprise for you.

1507
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,916
Three days at the Marion Springs Resort.

1508
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,438
You know, kind of a little apology
for the spa day I crashed.

1509
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,240
Yes, a little quality time, baby.

1510
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,549
Quality time.

1511
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,553
Yeah, baby, but Megan and
Reggie are on their honeymoon.

1512
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,159
I got the baby this weekend.

1513
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,113
Me and my AMMO squad.

1514
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,194
You and Theresa go ahead, have fun.
You still got them blue pills, right?

1515
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,476
I don't need no damn blue pills.

1516
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,196
- That's what you said about your glasses.
- That baby looks good on you, Mike.

1517
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:11,751
- You do look good holding a baby, Mike.
- Yeah, you think?

1518
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,840
I do.

1519
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,311
You good, Mike?
Let's go, team.

1520
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,629
- Yep.
- Wait, nothing...

1521
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:21,077
Wait, no. What you talking about?
Nah, we said we were doing this together.

1522
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:24,398
Oh, no, I have to work. I'll check
on you tomorrow. I'll bring wine.

1523
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,296
- Rita, stop playing. Hey, no.
- You'll need it.

1524
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:30,837
- Y'all all agreed that we were all gonna stay with the baby.
- Marcus, I'm gonna see you. I'll be in the car.

1525

Opportunity may have presented itself
for you to pay down some of that debt.
