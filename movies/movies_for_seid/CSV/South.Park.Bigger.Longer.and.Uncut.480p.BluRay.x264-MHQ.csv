45,Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America.
46,You have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
47, But why?
48, Because this movie has naughty language!

144,"Anyone? Come on, don't be shy."
145,"I think I know the answer, Mr. Garrison."
146," Shut up, fat boy!"

165,"How would you like to suck my balls, Mr. Garrison?"
166,"Holy shit, dude."
167,"Well, I must say, I'm very disappointed in you boys, m'kay?"
168,You should be ashamed of yourselves.
169,And I've already called in your mothers...
170, You called my mom?
171, That's right.
172," Oh, no, dude!"
173," Mr. Mackey, can I ask a question?"
174,M'kay. What?
175," What's the big fucking deal, bitch?"
176, Yeah.
177,"Ah! Now I wanna know where you heard these horrific obscenities, m'kay?"
178,Nowhere.
179,We heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before.
180, Yeah.
181," Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said, ""Eat penguin shit, you ass spelunker."" Sweet."
182,Uhoh!
183,Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
184,"This just isn't like you, Stanley."
185,"What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?"
186,"Did he say the ""S"" word?"
187," No, it was worse than that."
188," The ""F"" word?"
189,"Well, here's a short list of the things they've been saying, m'kay?"
190, Oh! Dear God!
191, What the heck is a rim job?
192,Why that's when you put your legs behind your head and have someone lick your ass.
193,"Young man, you will tell Mr. Mackey this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases!"
194,I... I...
195,We can't tell you.
196,We all took a sacred oath and swore ourselves to secrecy.
197, It was the Terrance and Phillip movie.
198, Dude!
199,What? Fuck you guys!
200,I wanna get out of here!
201,Terrance and Phillip?
202,Those Canadians?
203,"Excuse me, what the heck is Terrance and Phillip?"
204,Terrance and Phillip are two very untalented actors from Canada.
205,Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.
206,"Well, I guess I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents before more children see Terrance and Phillip."
207, Everybody's fucking seen it!
208, Eric!
209,"I'm sorry, I can't help myself."
210,That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
211,There's the girI that I like Over there laughing with that smart new...
212,You're holding up the goddamn lunch line!
213," Hello there, children."
214," Hey, Chef."
215, How's it going?
216, Bad.
217, Why bad?
218, We got busted for swearing.
219,Our moms say we can't ever see the Terrance and Phillip movie again!
220,Oh! That's too bad.
221,You should've seen Kyle when his mom showed up.
222,He was scared out of his mind.
223," Shut up, Cartman!"
224," No, dude. I'd be scared, too."
225,Your mom's a fucking bitch.
226,"Don't call my mom a bitch, you fat fuck!"
227,"Don't call me fat, you buttfucking son of a bitch!"
228,"Whoa, children, where did you learn to talk like that?"
229,"It's pretty fucking sweet, huh?"
230,"Chef, how do you make a woman like you more than any other guy?"
231,Oh! That's easy.
232, You just gotta find the clitoris.
233, Huh?
234,Whoops!
235,"What does that mean, ""Find the clitoris""?"
236,Forget I said anything.
237,"Move along, children, you're holding up the line."
238,"You guys, do you know where I can find the clitoris?"
239,The what?
240,"What, is that like finding Jesus or something?"
241,"Attention, students."
242,We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary.
243,Terrance and Phillip shirts are no longer allowed in school.
244,Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be sent home immediately.
245, Hooray!
246, Hooray!
247,The Rrated Canadian film Asses of Fire is number one at the box office.
248,But is the film destroying American youth?
249,Here with a special report is a midget in a bikini.
250,"Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects of the Canadian comedy are farreaching indeed."
251,"All over America, children seem to be influenced, like at this spelling bee in Washington."
252,All right. This is for the silver medal.
253,"Spell ""forensics."" Fuck that! Why should I fucking have to spell ""forensics""?"
254, Yeah.
255, Yeah.
256,Here you go. SUCKMYASS.
257,Forensics.
258,"Tom, the devastating impact of the Canadian duo can also be seen with their new hit song Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucka."
259,"Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka You're a bonerbiting bastard Uncle fucka Thought I told you that we won't stop Thought I told you that we won't stop  Back to you, Tom."
260," Thanks, midget."
261,Shocking report.
262,The controversy began in the small mountain town of South Park where the local PTA is trying to ban the movie.
263,"With us tonight is the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski."
264," Hello, Tom."
265, And the Canadian Minister of Movies.
266,"Thanks for having me, buddy."
267,"Minister, parents are concerned about your country's entertainment."
268,Your thoughts?
269,"Well, the film is Rrated and is not intended for children."
270,But of course children are gonna see it!
271,Can I finish?
272,The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage.
273, You just don't care!
274, Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish?
275,The United States has graphic violence on television all the time.
276,We can't believe that a movie with some foul language would piss you off so much.
277,Because it's evil!
278,Can I finish?
279,Please! Can I finish?
280,"Okay, I'm finished."
281,"But, Mr. Minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada."
282,Let us not forget Bryan Adams.
283,"Now, now. The Canadian government has apologized for Bryan Adams on several occasions."
284,"You Canadians are all the same, with your beady little eyes and flapping heads!"
285, You're trash.
286, I resent that! I find that racist!
287,Our children are now addicted to your filth!
288,"You are a racist, ma'am."
289,You are a racist.
290,It is going to take us weeks to erase the damage this film has done to our children!
291,"Kids, I wanna welcome you to rehabilitation, m'kay?"
292,Your mothers insisted that you be taken from your normal schoolwork and placed into rehab to learn not to swear.
293,"I must say, I don't think I belong with these rogues."
294,I attended school at Yardale and had a 4.0 grade point average.
295,"You're a fucking faggot, dude."
296,"M'kay. You see, children?"
297,This is exactly what I'm talking about.
298,We have to get you off of foul language.
299, How are we gonna do that?
300," Well, listen here."
301,"There are times when you get suckered in By drugs and alcohol and sex with women, m'kay?"
302,"But it's when you do these things too much That you've become an addict and must get back in touch You can do it It's all up to you, m'kay?"
303,"With a little plan you can change your life today You don't have to spend your life addicted to smack Homeless on the streets giving handjobs for crack Follow my plan and very soon you will say ""It's easy, m'kay?""

314,"Well, Phillip, I hope you've learned something through this whole experience."
315,"I did, Terrance. I learned that you are a bonerbiting dickfart fuckface."
316,Want to see the northern lights?
317,You burned yourself to death by lighting your fart!
318,"I sure did, Phillip."
319,Uncle fucker! Too tight!
320,"Man, that movie gets better every time I see it."
321, Hey!
322," Yeah, but you know what?"
323,That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit.
324,You can't do that.
325,No way!
326,"Okay, Kenny, I'll bet you $100 you can't light a fart on fire!"
327," Holy shit, dude!"
328," Ahh! Oh, my God!"

338,Now our moms are gonna find out we went to the Terrance and Phillip movie again!
339,Vacuum!
340,Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus.
341, Dude!
342," No, that doesn't go there!"
343,Oh!
344," Gross, Stan!"
345, That's sick.
346, Watch his liver.
347, I'll get it.
348,"We have precious little time left, people."
349,We're gonna lose him soon.

351, Let's get it out of there.
352,We need to zap this quick!
353, Who's making a potato?
354," My bad, sir. I missed lunch."
355,Damn it! I'm not gonna lose this kid!
356,Close him up. We've done all we can.
357,The rest is up to God.
358,"Kenny? Kenny, can you hear me?"
359,"How are you feeling, son?"
360,"Great. Son, I have some bad news."
361,We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato.

363,"Ah! Fucking weak, dude!"
364," Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!"
365, You bastards!
366,Damn it! It never gets any easier!
367,I bet him he couldn't do it.

369,"Come on, Cartman, it's not your fault."
370,"No, I know. I'm just fucking stoked I don't have to pay him."
371,Oh! That's real nice!
372,"He was your friend, you fat fuck!"
373,"So, boys, you saw that movie again?"

394,There is orderliness in the universe.
395,"Hell isn't good, hell isn't good No!"
396,"Parents, our children are out of control!"
397,This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!
398,That's right. Kenny set himself on fire because he saw Terrance and Phillip do it in that dirty movie!
399,We must stop dirty language from getting to our children's ears!
400,We must go fight the source of it!
401,But what is the source?
402,Oh! That's easy.
403,Times have changed Our kids are getting worse They won't obey their parents They just want to fart and curse Should we blame the government?
404,Or blame society?
405,Or should we blame the images on TV?
406,No! Blame Canada!
407,Blame Canada!
408,With all their beady little eyes and flapping heads so full of lies Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
409,We need to form a full assault It's Canada's fault!
410,"Don't blame me for my son Stan He saw the darn cartoon and now he's off to join the Klan And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf But now when I see him he tells me to fuck myself Well, Blame Canada! Blame Canada!"
411,It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
412,"They're not even a real country anyway My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true Instead, he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue Should we blame the matches?"
413,Should we blame the fire?
414,Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?
415,"Heck, no!"
416,Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
417,"With all their hockey hullabaloo And that bitch Anne Murray, too Blame Canada! Shame on Canada!"
418,For The smut we must stop The trash we must bash The laughter and fun must all be undone We must blame them and cause a fuss Before somebody thinks of blaming us!
419,"All right, you turds, listen up!"
420,Your moms are away at a meeting and they put me in charge of you!
421,"But you're still grounded, so you're not allowed to have any fun!"
422, Any questions?
423," Shelly, where's the clitoris?"
424,Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
425,"Okay, it's clear."
426,Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now.
427,Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!
428,Hooray!
429," Hello, Conan."
430," Hello, Brooke Shields."
431,"Now, guys, some people claim that your Canadian humor is nothing but immature fart jokes."

434,"Yes, Phillip?"
435,Gosh darn it!
436," Good one, Phillip. Cheers."
437," Cheers, fuckface."
438,"Guys, you can't say that on TV."
439,Now Terrance smells like my ass!
440,I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon.
441,"So, guys, does it make you nervous to be in America?"
442,There are a lot of organizations here that want you arrested for destroying children.
443, Oh! They'd have to find us first.
444, You're right.
445,Now!
446,"Terrance and Phillip, Mothers Against Canada is placing you under citizen's arrest!"
447, Mom?
448," Dude, what the hell is going on?"
449,We have a court order for your arrest!
450,"Phillip, we've been ambushed!"
451,"Here you go, Conan."
452,This little scrotum sucker deceived us!
453, You are a bad man!
454," Don't listen to them, Conan!"
455,"You loved our movie, Conan!"
456,We watched it together!
457, Remember? You laughed!
458, What have I done?
459,Holy crap! Did you see that?
460,They arrested Terrance and Phillip!
461,"As the Canadian Ambassador, I hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and Phillip."
462,"As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip!"
463,"Without them, we are doomed to recession."
464,"What say you, Mr. American Ambassador?"
465, Fuck Canada!
466," Hey, fuck you, buddy!"
467,Terrance and Phillip will not be released!
468,They're going to be put on trial for corrupting America's youth.
469,We don't know what all the fuss is about.
470,The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!
471,It's aboot not censoring our art!
472,It's aboot... It's aboot...
473,What's so goddamn funny?
474,"Nothing, nothing."
475,Could you tell us again what your argument is all about?
476,"This is not aboot diplomacy, this is aboot dignity!"
477,This is aboot respect!
478,This is aboot realizing that humor...
479,You guys are dicks!
480,Release Terrance and Phillip or we'll give you something to cry aboot!
481,Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to bombardier.
482,We're nearing the target.
483,"The bomb's ready, buddy."
484,Baldwin residence.
485,"No, this is Billy Baldwin."
486,"If you want Daniel Baldwin, call his extension, stupid!"
487,"Hey, Alec, do you know what sucks about being a Baldwin?"
488," No, what?"
489, Nothing! Yeah!
490,You missed me!
491,"All right, children, your mothers are all making me throw away my lesson plan and teach theirs."
492,"Mr. Garrison, how come our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip?"
493, Yeah!
494, That's gay.
495,"Well, your moms are just upset."
496,They're probably all on their periods or something.
497,"Mr. Garrison, Wendy and I think that was a sexist statement."
498,"Well, I'm sorry, Wendy, but I just don't trust anything that bleeds for five days and doesn't die."
499,"Anyway, children, let's start off with some vocabulary."
500," Attention, students!"
501, Oh! What now?
502,"Come to the gymnasium immediately for a special announcement, m'kay?"
503," What's going on, Chef?"
504," Something big, children."
505,"Chef, I can't find the clitoris."
506,You have to help me.
507,"Stan, the clitoris..."
508,"Please take your seats, everyone."
509,"They're about to announce it, m'kay?"
510,This is a state of emergency.
511,We go now to the White House for an announcement from the President of the United States.
512,"My fellow Americans, at 5:00 a.m. today, a day which will live in infamy, the Canadians have bombed the Baldwins."
513,"In response to this, the U.S. has declared war on Canada."
514," Oh, no!"
515, War?
516," No, Gregory! No!"
517," This is bad, Wendy. Hold on to me."
518,All the Baldwins are dead?
519,Now it is the time for us to send a message to Canadians.
520,"In two days time, the war criminals Terrance and Phillip will be executed."
521,They're gonna kill them?
522,"And now I'd like to bring up my newly appointed Secretary of Offense, Ms. Sheila Broflovski."
523,"Holy shit, dude!"
524,"My fellow Americans, our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time!"
525, I have a plan...
526, The Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths!
527,"Well, if it is war they want, then war they shall have!"
528," Dude, this is fucking weak."
529, How could things be any worse?
530,"Fallen one, I am Satan."
531,I am your god now.
532,There is no escape.
533,"Now, feel the delightful pain."
534,"Hey, Satan, did you hear the news?"
535,A war just broke out up on Earth.
536,"Meet Saddam Hussein, my new partner in evil."
537,"Move over, Satan, you're hogging all the fun."
538,Yeah! Yeah!
539,"Man, this is getting me so hot!"
540,"Saddam, would you let me do my job, please?"
541,"Come on, rub my nipples while I torture this little piggy!"
542,"Saddam, could I talk to you over here for a second?"
543,I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
544,"Aye! Relax, guy!"
545,"Well, sometimes I think you don't have any respect for me."
546,"Hey, come here, guy."
547, Who's my cream puff?
548, I am.
549,"That's right, buddy."
550," Dude, I don't want to be at war."
551," You don't think they're really gonna kill Terrance and Phillip, do you?"
552,"Kyle, you need to stop being such a chicken shit and stand up to your mother."
553,"You need to smack her in the face and say, ""That's enough of your shit, you fucking bitch!"" Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
554,You guys stop it! This isn't helping!
555,We've gotta think here!
556,"Now, let's see, what would Brian Boitano do?"
557,"Yeah, what would Brian Boitano do?"
558,"Hey, what's going on over there?"
559,The American government thinks it has the right to police the world.
560,"Your government is going to kill two Canadian citizens, an action condemned by the U. N."
561,"Home of the free, indeed."
562, Let's play tetherball.
563, Yeah.
564,This is about freedom of speech!
565,About censorship!
566,Can't you guys be more political like Gregory?
567,"There's the girI that I like Now it appears that she likes another guy It must be because he's political and stuff I bet I could be political, too What do you think, Stan?"
568, Damn it!
569," You guys, this is all Kyle's mom's fault!"
570,"Shut up, Cartman!"
571,"Kyle's mom is the one that started that damn club, and all because she's a big, fat, stupid..."
572,"Don't say it, Cartman!"
573,Well...
574,"Don't do it, Cartman!"
575,Well...
576, I'm warning you!
577, Okay. Okay.
578,I'm getting pretty sick of him calling my mom...
579,"well, Kyle's mom's a bitch She's a big fat witch She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world She's a stupid bitch if there ever was a bitch She's a bitch to all the boys and girls Shut your fucking mouth, Cartman!"
580,"On Monday she's a bitch On Tuesday she's a bitch And Wednesday through Saturday she's a bitch Then on Sunday, just to be different She's a super King Kamehameha bitch!"
581,"Come on, you all know the words!"
582,Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?
583,"She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world She's a mean old bitch and she has stupid hair She's a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch She's a stupid bitch Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch Talk to kids around the world It might go a little bit something like this Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?"

585,"Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch I really mean it Kyle's mom She's a big fat fucking bitch Big, old, fat fucking bitch, Kyle's mom Yeah!"
586,What?
587,Oh!
588,Fuck.
589,"Okay, everyone settle down."
590,"As we continue to send troops into Canada, M.A.C. is also fighting the war against potty mouths here at home!"
591,Here to present the VChip is Dr. Vosknocker.
592,The machinery of the VChip is very simple.
593,It is placed under the child's skin where it emits a small shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered.
594,"Now, wait a minute."
595,This chip somehow knows if the child is swearing?
596,It's just like a lie detector.
597,"You see, certain things happen to you when you swear, just like when you lie."
598,The chip picks up on this and gives the subject a little prick.
599,"Patient B5, would you step out here, please?"
600,Patient B5 here has been fitted with the new VChip.
601, Ow! My head hurts.
602, Don't worry about that.
603,"Now I want you to say ""doggy.""  Doggy."
604, Notice that nothing happens.
605," Now say ""Montana.""  Montana."
606,"Good! Now, ""pillow.""  Pillow."
607, All right.
608,"Now I want you to say ""horse fucker."" Go ahead, Eric. It's all right."
609,Horse...
610,"That hurt, goddamn... Fuck!"
611,"Now I'd like you to say ""big floppy donkey dick.""  No!"
612, Success!
613,The child doesn't want to swear!
614,"This isn't fair, you sons of bitches!"
615,We will start putting VChips in all our children next week!
616,Snacky Smores presents The March of War.
617,Let's hear it for our boys in blue.
618,President Clinton has called them to action to fight the eviI Canadian scourge.
619,A fullscale attack has been launched on Toronto after the Canadians' last bombing which took a horrible toll on the Arquette family.
620,"For security measures, our great American government is rounding up all citizens that have any Canadian blood and putting them into camps."
621,All CanadianAmerican citizens are to report to one of these death camps right away.
622,Did I say death camps?
623,"I meant happy camps, where you will eat the finest meals, have access to fabulous doctors and be able to exercise regularly."
624,"Meanwhile, the war criminals Terrance and Phillip are prepped for their execution."
625,Their execution will take place during a fabulous USO show!
626,"With special guests celebrities, including Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder!"
627,"Of course, the only way to see the USO show is to sign up for the army!"
628,So join the army and kill some Canadian scum as we continue the march of war!
629,We must rid ourselves of anything Canadian!
630,Bomb them!
631,"Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore?"
632,Course not! My mommy says I hate Canadians now 'cause they made me have a dirty mouth!
633,Burn it all!
634," Hey, dudes."
635," What's the matter, Cartman?"
636,It's this VChip. I hate it.
637,I can't say any dirty words.
638," Really? So you can't say ""fuck""?"
639, No.
640," And you can't say ""shit""?"
641, No.
642,"So you can't say, ""I'm Eric Cartman, ""the fattest fucking piece of shit in the world""?"
643, Fuck you...
644, Sweet.
645,"Come on, you guys."
646,This has gone far enough.
647,It's time we talked to our moms.
648,We're supposed to be grounded in our rooms.
649,"Come on, Kyle, it's time for us to get political."
650,Canada will no longer corrupt our children!
651," Mom, can I talk to you for a second?"
652," Kyle, what are you doing here?"
653,You are grounded!
654,Now get back to the house and stay there!
655,"You too, Stanley!"
656,"Mom, we think you're going too far."
657,You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.
658,We must fight for our children's futures...
659,You started a war! You have to stop it!
660,...to make them safe again!
661, Hello?
662, Our children are precious!
663, Hello!
664, We must make a stand now!
665,Stop at nothing!
666,I told you my mom wouldn't listen.
667,"Well, then we're just gonna have to save Terrance and Phillip ourselves!"
668, What?
669," Think about it, you guys."
670,What would Brian Boitano do?
671,He'd figure out a way to rescue Terrance and Phillip before they're executed.
672,We can't do anything.
673,Our moms' organization is too strong.
674,"Well, then, we'll round up all the grounded kids in town and start our own organization."
675,An organization to help save Terrance and Phillip.
676,"Hey, yeah, our own secret club!"
677, I guess that could work.
678, We have to try.
679,What would Brian Boitano do if he was here right now?
680,He'd make a plan and he'd follow through That's what Brian Boitano would do When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics skating for the gold He did two salchows and a triple Lutz while wearing a blindfold When Brian Boitano was in the Alps fighting grizzly bears He used his magical fire breath and saved the maidens fair So what would Brian Boitano do if he were here today?
681,"I'm sure he'd kick and ass or two That's what Brian Boitano would do I want this VChip out of me It has stunted my vocabulary And I just want my mom to stop fighting everyone For Wendy I'll be an activist, too 'Cause that's what Brian Boitano would do What would Brian Boitano do?"
682,He'd call all the kids in town And tell them to unite for truth That's what Brian Boitano would do  Did someone say my name?
683, Who are you?
684, I'm Brian Dennehy.
685, What?
686," No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!"
687, Yeah. Get the fuck out of here!
688,Oh! Bye.
689,"When Brian Boitano traveled through time To the year 3010 He fought the evil robot king and saved the human race again And when Brian Boitano built the pyramids He beat up Kublai Khan 'Cause Brian Boitano doesn't take shit from anybody So let's call all the kids together and unite to stop our moms And we'll save Terrance and Phillip, too 'Cause that's what Brian Boitano would do And we'll save Terrance and Phillip, too 'Cause that's what Brian Boitano would do 'Cause that's what Brian Boitano would do Hey, relax, guy."
690,Oh! There's nothing on.
691,"You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all."
692,I'm not cranky.
693,What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War lll!
694, World War lll?
695, Shh!
696,Terrance and Phillip are going to be put to death for crimes against humanity.
697,The time of execution...
698,It has come to be.
699,The four horsemen are drawing nigh!
700,The time of prophecy is upon us!
701,"I love when you get all biblical, Satan."
702,You know exactly how to turn my crank.
703,"No, I'm being serious."
704,It is the seventh sign.
705, What?
706, Behold.
707,The first signs of my reign have all come true.
708,"The fall of an empire, the coming of a comet, and now, when the blood of these Canadians touches American soil, it will be our time to rise."
709,"Yeah. Yeah, man! I'm getting so hot!"
710,Let's fuck!
711,Do you always think about sex?
712,I'm talking about very important stuff here!
713,I'm just excited about taking over the world! Come on!
714,Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
715,I love you.
716,I want to believe that.
717,"So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?"
718,Oh! Ow!
719,"Yeah, you like that, don't you, bitch?"
720,Okay. We can use my dad's computer to call all the kids together.
721,"Wait. Before we put a message out, do a search on the word ""clitoris."" Oh! Okay."
722,"Found eight million pages with the word ""clitoris."" Wow!"
723,I'll just try the first one.
724,"""You must be 18 to enter this website."" Okay."
725,"""Welcome to German sick fetish video."" ""If you are under 18 do not..."" Okay."
726,"Dude, it's a lady getting pooed on!"
727, Whoa! Is it Cartman's mom?
728, Very funny.
729,Hey! It is Cartman's mom!
730,All righty then.
731,Son of a bitch...
732,"Get out of here, Ike."
733,You're too young for this stuff.
734,Bullshit.
735,What's she doing now?
736,Okeydokey.
737,"Click it off, dude! Click it off!"
738,"Dude, what the fuck is wrong with German people?"
739,All right. All right.
740,Let's just do what we came here to do and put a message out to kids!
741,Okay. Let's see. I've gotta put out an allaccess email.
742,"Goddamn, your mom sucks, Cartman."
743,Just get to the message board!
744,I'm trying. I can't find a Canadian server.
745,I've got to break into the mainframe.
746,"Damn it, they've got an access code!"
747,I'll try to reroute the encryptions.
748,Okay. Here we go.
749,"""Want to help Terrance and Phillip?""  Tell them we'll have punch and pie."
750, We're not gonna have punch and pie!
751,More people will come if they think we have punch and pie!
752,"""This is top secret. The password is..."" La R sistance."
753,And so the draft will begin tomorrow as more and more troops are needed to invade the Canadian border.
754,"The Canadian government pleads for a peaceful resolution, but naturally we're not listening."
755,"Good night, hon."
756,"Mom, when is the war gonna be over?"
757,"I don't know, hon. Soon, we hope."
758,"You want it to end quickly, huh?"
759, Mom?
760," Yes, hon?"
761,"If you were in a German Schei e video, you'd tell me, right?"
762,"Sure, hon. Good night."
763,There's a ghost!
764,"Kenny, is that you?"
765,Satan! Satan is coming here?
766,Saddam Hussein?
767,"That doesn't make sense, Kenny!"
768," Eric, what is it?"
769, I saw him! I saw Kenny!
770,Oh! You poor dear.
771,You've been through so much.
772,I bet him he couldn't light a fart on fire and now he's all pissed off!
773,"I can't say ""pissed off""?"
774,The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent.
775,"Soon, Saddam and I will rule the world."
776,"Hi, Satan. I got some new luggage for our trip up to Earth."
777,Let's fuck to celebrate.
778,"What's it like up on Earth, Saddam?"
779,Tell me about it again.
780,Let's not talk. Let's get busy.
781,Do you remember when you first got here?
782,We used to talk all night long until the sun came up.
783,We would just lie in bed and talk.
784,"Well, yeah, 'cause I was still waiting to get you in bed, dummy!"
785,How come you always wanna make love to me from behind?
786,Is it because you want to pretend I'm somebody else?
787,"Satan, your ass is gigantic and red."
788,"Who am I gonna pretend you are, Liza Minnelli?"
789,Ah! Don't get all pissy!
790,"Sometimes I think When I look up real high That there's such a big world up there I'd like to give it a try But then I sink 'Cause it's here I'm supposed to stay But I get so lonely down here Tell me why's it have to be that way Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream, too Up there Up where the skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care Up there They say I don't belong I must stay below alone Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown But what is evil anyway?"
791,Is there reason to the rhyme?
792,"Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream, too Up there Up where the skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care Live without a care If only I could live up there I wanna live I wanna live I want to live up there!"
793," You're late, Cartman!"
794, I had to ride my bike here.
795, My behind is killing me!
796, Your behind?
797,"I have to say ""behind"" 'cause I get shocked if I say ""ass""..."
798, Did you bring the punch and pie?
799," No, you guys, something happened."
800, I don't think Kenny's dead.
801, What?
802,I saw him in my room.
803,"I know, Cartman, I know."
804,I see Kenny every day.
805, You do?
806," Sure, dude, on the face of every child."
807,On the smile of every baby.
808,"Hey, I'm telling you, this was Kenny!"
809,"He said that if Terrance and Phillip die, Saddam Hussein and Satan are gonna come up and rule the world!"
810,Saddam Hussein?
811,Who is it?
812,I'm here for la R sistance.
813, What's the password?
814, I don't know.
815, Guess.
816, Bacon.
817,Okay.
818,"Oh, no, it's that kid!"
819, This is the place.
820, Wendy?
821,Stan? You started la R sistance?
822,"Well, apparently you're more political than we thought."
823,Let us get this meeting underway.
824,There are others coming.
825,"Wow, a lot of people showed up."
826,Okay.
827,"Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!"
828,Yes?
829,We were to understand there'd be pie and punch.
830,There isn't any.
831,Oh!
832,"Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, so we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen and have pizza sent to them that they didn't order!"
833, May I?
834, What?
835,Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian internment camp two kilometers outside of town.
836,They're to be executed tomorrow during a starstudded USO show for the troops.
837,Tomorrow?
838,"Once the show begins, we should have about one hour to get Terrance and Phillip out of their cell and into this clearing."
839,"There, we will all rendezvous and, together, take Terrance and Phillip safely back to Canada."
840,"Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart."
841,You must all meet me at the rendezvous point at precisely 10:00 p.m.
842,"Sneaking into the show and breaking out Terrance and Phillip will be the most dangerous part, so I'll go myself."
843,No! We're going!
844,We started la R sistance.
845,We'll get Terrance and Phillip and meet you at the rendezvous point.
846,This will be very dangerous.
847,Are you quite sure?
848,Fuck that!
849,"Cartman, do you want that VChip in you forever?"
850,We're going.
851,Now let's run through the plan.
852,"Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!"
853,Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!
854,I think we're fighting Canadians.
855,"Canadians, Australians, what's the difference?"
856,"Yeah. This uniform makes me feel like a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat."
857,"It sure does, Mr. Garrison."
858,"Oh, boy, I can't wait for our first shore leave so I can get me some fucking poontang."
859,Pay attention!
860,Tomorrow night is the USO show for all you troops!
861,"There will be celebrities, followed by the execution of Terrance and Phillip."
862,"After the show, we will finally be sending ground troops into Canada."
863,So let's strategize.
864,Map!
865,"Our sources have told us that the Canadians are preparing for our invasion, so we must use caution."
866,Each battalion has a specific code name and mission.
867,"Battalion Five, raise your hands."
868,"You will be the allimportant first attack wave, which we will call Operation Human Shield."
869,"Hey, wait a minute!"
870,"Now keep in mind, Operation Human Shield will suffer heavy losses."
871,Battalion Fourteen?
872,Right. You are Operation Get Behind the Darkies.
873,You will follow Battalion Five here.
874,"And try not to get killed, for God's sake."
875,"Are there any questions, men?"
876,"Yes, soldier?"
877,Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
878,I don't listen to hiphop.
879,"After that, we will march into the heart of Canada and we will..."
880,I'm coming to get you!
881,I'm coming to get you!
882,What's wrong with this thing?
883,It's fucking Windows 98!
884,Get Bill Gates in here!
885,You told us Windows 98 would be faster and more efficient with better access to the Internet.
886,It is faster. Over five million...
887,"All right, men, get lots of rest and prepare to go into Canada!"
888,"After you have Terrance and Phillip, quietly make your way to this ridge."
889,We will be waiting for you there.
890,"We cannot wait for long, so if you're not there at 10:00, we'll have to leave."
891, Got you.
892," You are indeed brave, but you will need help from someone who's done this sort of thing before."
893, Here's the address of The Mole.
894, The Mole?
895,He is an expert in covert operations.
896,A mercenary for hire.
897,Your first task will be obtaining him.
898,Get lots of sleep.
899,"Tomorrow, we will all be risking our lives for freedom."
900,"God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands And blessed be the children Who fight with all our bravery Till only the righteous stand You see the distant flames They bellow in the night You fight in all our names for what we know is right And when you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, la R sistance lives on You may get stabbed in the head with a dagger or a sword You may be burned to death or skinned alive or worse But when they torture you you will not feel the need to run For though you die la R sistance lives on Blame Canada!"
901,Blame Canada!
902,Because the country's gone awry Tomorrow night these freaks will fry!
903,"Tomorrow night Our lives will change Tomorrow night, we'll be entertained An execution What a sight Tomorrow night Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Tomorrow night, up there is doomed And so I will be going soon Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka You're a bonerbiting bastard Uncle fucka Looks like we may be out of luck Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked Why did our mothers start this war?"
904,What the fuck are they fighting for?
905,When did this song become a marathon?
906, I want to be up there...
907, When Canada is dead and gone There'll be no more Celine Dion!
908,"They might cut your dick in half and serve it to a pig And though it hurts you'll laugh and dance a dickless jig But that's the way it goes In war, you're shat upon  Though we die..."
909, I want to be up there...
910,...la R sistance lives on!
911,Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
912, Tomorrow night!
913, Tomorrow night!
914,"Oh, boy, I'm so excited!"
915,Just one more day until we can take over the world.
916,"I don't know if I can sleep, if you know what I mean."
917,This book is really interesting.
918,It talks about how people communicate differently.
919,"Like, I communicate by wanting you to ask me questions, and you..."
920,"Hey, that is interesting! Let's fuck!"
921,"Saddam, I'm trying to have a nice conversation with you."
922,"Hey, Satan."
923,Oh! Now that is just not appropriate!
924,"Come on, I'm just fucking with you!"
925,It's not real!
926," Well, that is still not appropriate."
927," Hey, daddy."
928,"It's not real, either!"
929,"Come on, guy!"
930,Oh!
931,Soon the world will belong to me!
932,"It's Saddam, he doesn't nurture my emotions."
933,He just wants sex and can't learn to communicate.
934,"You're right, I should leave him!"
935,"I'm just gonna tell him, ""Saddam, I'm going to Earth to rule alone!"" I'm strong and I don't need him!"
936,Today's the day for the USO show we're so happy we get to go I don't know but I've been told Canadian pussy is mighty cold...
937,"Ike, you have to stay in the attic 'cause if they find you, they'll put you in a Canadian concentration camp."
938,"Don't worry, Ike, we're gonna put an end to this."
939,And then I'll make Mom come home and we'll all be a family again.
940,All of that is home.
941, Hello?
942, Hi. We need to speak with The Mole.
943,"I'm sorry, The Mole is grounded."
944,He can't come out and play.
945, What?
946, He's a kid?
947,He said very naughty things about God.
948,"Oh! Well, can we just talk to him for five seconds, please?"
949,"Well, all right. Christophe?"
950,"Hi, we're gonna go rescue Terrance and Phillip from the USO show and..."
951, Shh! Who are you? Who sent you?
952, That Gregory kid.
953,He said you could sneak us in.
954,"Are you telling me that you intend to break into the USO show, filled with thousands of soldiers, and break out Terrance and Phillip?"
955,"I thought it was a pretty stupid idea, too."
956,We're la R sistance!
957,We wanna save Terrance and Phillip and stop the war and stuff.
958,I can't help you. I'm grounded in my room for the next three days.
959,So are we.
960,Our parents think we're home right now.
961,Why are you grounded?
962,"Why? Because God hates me, that's why."
963,He has made my life miserable.
964,So I call him a cocksucking asshole and I get grounded.
965, So will you help us?
966, Very well.
967,Meet me in the backyard in five minutes.
968,We'll show God that we're not gonna fucking take any more...
969,What?
970,"Christophe, get in here!"
971,"Coming, Mother."
972,I must be strong. I must be strong.
973,"Saddam, I need to talk to you."
974,"You better get packing, bitch."
975,We have to go.
976,We're running out of time.
977,"Saddam, sometimes you can love a person very much, but still know that they aren't right for you."
978,What the fuck are you talking about?
979,"You treat me like shit, Saddam!"
980,I'm leaving you!
981,I'm going up to Earth to rule alone!
982,"No. No, you can't do that!"
983," I'm sorry, but I have to be strong."
984," Satan, please, give me another chance!"
985, I have to go to Earth!
986, You don't even have respect for me!
987,"Sure I do, guy. Please, just hear me out."
988,"Some people say that I'm a bad guy They may be right They may be right But it's not as if I don't try I just fuck up, try as I might But I can change, I can change I can learn to keep my promises I swear it I'll open up my heart and I will share it Any minute now I will be born again Yes, I can change, I can change I know I've been a dirty little bastard I like to kill, I like to maim Yes, I'm insane, but it's okay 'cause I can change It's not my fault that I'm so evil It's society Society You see, my parents were sometimes abusive And it made a prick of me But I can change, I can change What if you remain a sandy little butthole?"
989,"Satan, don't be such a twit Mother Teresa won't have shit on me Just watch Just watch me change Here I go I'm changing You see, I've really matured."
990, Oh! All right.
991, All right!
992, Come on. We have to hurry.
993, I love you.
994,"Ladies and gentlemen of the American Army, welcome to the USO show!"
995,"Get ready for loads of entertainment and fabulous celebrities, followed immediately by the nasty execution of Terrance and Phillip!"
996,This is the USO show where those military bitches intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.
997," Oh, my God!"
998, God?
999,He is the biggest bitch of them all.
1000,We have to hurry. We rendezvous with the other kids at 10:00.
1001,"You realize that by doing this, we could be grounded for two, perhaps even three weeks."
1002, We're willing to take that risk.
1003, Then let's go.
1004,"And now, here are your hosts for the evening, Sheila Broflovski and Big Gay Al!"
1005,"Al, tonight is a very special night, do you know why?"
1006,Ooh! They're having a sale at Merv's?
1007,"No, because we're going to abolish Canadian smut!"
1008,"That's right, Sheila!"
1009,Bring out the condemned!
1010,Today is a great day for democracy!
1011,"Phillip, this is worse than that night I fell asleep and you put your dick in my mouth and took a picture!"
1012,"I know, Terrance. I know."
1013,"Well, Sheila, while you're getting set up over there, let's bring out our first act, Yippie the backflipping dog!"
1014,Be careful not to touch this wire.
1015,Motherfucker...
1016,Fuck...
1017,"Shit, the USO show has started!"
1018,We are running out of time!
1019,Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
1020,"Yes, but they are heavily guarded."
1021,We have to dig from here so as not to be seen.
1022,"Come on, bitches."
1023,"Hey, Mole, do you know where the clitoris is?"
1024, The what?
1025, The clitoris.
1026,I have to find the clitoris so I can get this Wendy girl to like me again.
1027,You need to stop thinking with your dick!
1028,You have to be on your toes because I am not going to be grounded again!
1029,Not for you. Not for anybody.
1030,"Men, when you're out there in the battlefield and you're looking into the beady eyes of a Canadian as he charges you with his hockey stick or whatever he has and people are dying all around you, just remember what the M. P.A.A. says."
1031,"""Horrific, deplorable violence is okay, ""as long as people don't say any naughty words!"" That is what this war is all about!"
1032,What?
1033,Shit!
1034,"Move, move!"
1035,Okay. We will split up here.
1036,Let's synchronize watches.
1037, We don't have watches.
1038, You don't have watches?
1039,"Dude, you didn't say anything about watches!"
1040,"What do you think this is, kid?"
1041,"TV kiddiehour where we all sit around and lick Barney the dinosaur's fucking pussy, huh?"
1042,"This is real life, with consequences you take to the grave!"
1043," Dude, we don't have watches."
1044, Shit! Did you bring the mirror?
1045, Got it!
1046, And the rope?
1047, Check.
1048, And the buttfor?
1049, What's a buttfor?
1050," For pooping, silly."
1051,"Now, listen carefully."
1052,"I will dig under the stage, and with that bedrock, I will need more time."
1053,"Stan and Kyle, get near that stage and stall the show any way you can."
1054,Do whatever it takes to keep that show going  until I get to the prisoners.
1055, Okay.
1056,"Cartman, over there is the electrical box."
1057,You must sneak over there and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be attacked by guard dogs.
1058, Got it?
1059, Okay.
1060,You must shut off the alarms!
1061,I fucking hate guard dogs!
1062,"I heard you the first time, you British piece of shit."
1063,"If anything goes wrong, make a sound like a dying giraffe."
1064,What's a dying giraffe sound like?
1065, Okay.
1066, Let's go.
1067," Be careful, dude."
1068, Careful?
1069,Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in the womb?
1070,"Damn, dude. That kid is fucked up."
1071," How are those chairs coming, Sheila?"
1072," Al, we're minutes away."
1073,"Super! In the meantime, here's pintsize pixie and darling of the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder!"
1074,"Hi, guys."
1075,I'm super psyched to be here today.
1076,What you're doing for our country is so cool.
1077,"I mean war, man. Wow. War, you know?"
1078,Wow.
1079,"Okay! And now for your enjoyment, here's my famous pingpong ball trick!"
1080,"Oh, my!"
1081,"""Shut off the power, Cartman."
1082,"""This is very important, Cartman."" Dude, did you hear what Winona Ryder's doing?"
1083,We can't miss this.
1084,"There, I didn't miss one!"
1085,That's my pingpong ball trick!
1086,"Well, that's all the acts we have for you tonight, so let's just get on with the execution!"
1087," Oh, no. We have to stall him."
1088, More! More!
1089,"Yeah, more!"
1090,You big sillies!
1091,You want to see more of me?
1092,Yeah! Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!
1093,Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!
1094,"Well, I do have a little song I wrote about the war."
1095,But we haven't rehearsed.
1096, Sing it!
1097," Yeah, sing it!"
1098, Oh! I can't.
1099, Sing the fucking song!
1100,"Well, all right, if you insist, I'll sing my song."
1101,I believe it goes a little bit like this.
1102,"Bombs are flying People are dying Children are crying Politicians are lying, too Cancer is killing Texaco's spilling The whole world's gone to hell But how are you?"
1103,"I'm super, thanks for asking All things considered I couldn't be better, I must say I'm feeling super No, nothing bugs me Everything is super when you're..."
1104,Don't you think I look cute in this hat?
1105,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple But I just can't feel too bad for you right now Because I'm feeling so insanely super That even the fact that you can't walk can't bring me down He's super, thanks for asking All things considered he couldn't be better, he must say I'm super No, nothing bugs me Everything is super when you're..."
1106,Don't you think I look cute in this hat?
1107,These little pants this matching tie that I got at Merv's I'm super In the barracks and the trenches as well  Stick 'em up!
1108," Big Gay Al says  ""Do ask, do tell""  Skittles Yes, he's super and he's proud to be gay Okay?"
1109,Everything is super when you're gay when you're gay!
1110,Again! Again!
1111,Who's there?
1112,Son of a gun! Heck!
1113,They're coming?
1114,But our moms won't listen to us!
1115,"Okay, everybody, just wanna take a minute here to thank all our wonderful sponsors we had tonight on this USO show."
1116, He's almost got them.
1117, Shh!
1118,We are here to rescue you.
1119,"After I release you, follow me through the tunnel."
1120, You guys! Seriously!
1121," What, Cartman?"
1122,Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
1123,"Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?"
1124,Cartman?
1125, Whoops!
1126, Oh! Shit!
1127,"Hey, did you hear that?"
1128,Sounds like a giraffe is dying over there.
1129, Shit!
1130, A spy!
1131,Get him!
1132,Shit! Shit!
1133,"Oh, no!"
1134,"Come on, Mole, come on!"
1135,Shit! Shit!
1136,Fucking guard dogs! Shit!
1137,"The alarms, they went off."
1138,"Yeah, that was my bad. Sorry."
1139,Hold me. It's so very cold.
1140,There is no hope now.
1141,You must get out of here.
1142, We can't leave without you!
1143," It's okay, I'm done for."
1144,"No, we can't leave without you!"
1145,We don't know where the hell we are!
1146,"Where is your God when you need him, huh?"
1147,"Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot now?"
1148,"Here I come, God."
1149,"Here I come, you fucking rat."
1150,"Now the light, she fades And darkness settles in But I will find strength No, Mole. Hang on."
1151,I will find pride within We'll get you home.
1152,Because although I die I can't face my mother.

1170, Kyle!
1171," Go on, dude, tell her."
1172, I can't.
1173,You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.
1174,"If they die, Satan and Saddam Hussein are gonna come take over the world!"
1175,"Throw the switch, Mr. Garrison."
1176,"Hey, I'm supposed to be anonymous."
1177,"Goodbye, bastards!"

1194,"Stan, you must not let Terrance and Phillip's blood be spilled on the ground."
1195,Wait! You're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
1196,There are more important matters right now.
1197,"No way, dude! I looked all over for you and now you have to tell me how to get Wendy to like me!"
1198,"Dude, you just have to have confidence in yourself."
1199,Believe in yourself and others will believe in you.
1200,"Chicks love confidence. Now go, hurry!"
1201,The clitoris has spoken.
1202,"Stan! Stan, are you okay?"
1203,I see you failed in your mission.

1233,Where are you going?
1234,We're going to find our boys!
1235,"For God's sake, Sheila, we're going to get them killed!"
1236,"Kyle, all those times I said you were a big, dumb Jew, I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew."
1237,"Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!"
1238,"No, no, Kyle, don't be so hard on yourself."
1239,What the hell am I still holding this for?
1240,Mr. Hat! No!
1241,"Fuck this, dude. I'm getting out of here before I get in really big trouble."
1242, I heard that.
1243, Stan!
1244,"Dude, I found the clitoris, so now I think I can get Wendy to like me again."
1245,"Oh! That's swell, Stan."

1255,"All right, men, fire!"
1256,"Goodbye, Terrance."
1257, What is this?
1258, Don't shoot!
1259,I'll take care of this.
1260,"Kids, get out of the way now!"
1261, Kyle!
1262," I'm not gonna let you kill them, Mom!"
1263,What? What? What?
1264,I'm not moving!
1265,"Stand down, children."
1266,You can still see fart jokes on Nickelodeon.
1267,No! This is about more than fart jokes!
1268,"This is about freedom of speech, about censorship and stuff."
1269,"What about Ike, huh, Mom?"
1270,Did you forget that your own adopted son is Canadian?
1271,I'm doing very important things.
1272,"But, Mom, you never took the time to talk to me."
1273,"Whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else, but I'm the one to blame. Deal with me."
1274,"You keep going off and fighting all these causes, but I don't want a fighter."
1275,I want my mom.
1276,Poor little fellow.
1277,No!
1278,Terrance!
1279," Holy shit, dude!"
1280," Young man, you watch your mouth!"
1281,My time has come!
1282,You are really fucked now!
1283,It's Saddam Hussein! Shoot him!
1284,What a dumbass!
1285,You have spilled the blood of the innocent!
1286,Now begins two million years of darkness!
1287,"Good job, Ms. Broflovski! Thanks a lot!"
1288,I was just trying to make the world a better place for children.
1289,"Yeah, and you brought enough intolerance to the world to allow my coming."
1290,"Now, everyone bow down to me!"
1291,Bend over!
1292,Whoa! What have we done?
1293,"Saddam, I am the dark ruler, not you."
1294,"Relax, bitch."
1295,"You're better seen, not heard."
1296,I can't.
1297,Let's start by building a big statue of me right over there where that fat kid is standing.
1298,"Hey, don't call me fat, buttfucker!"
1299,"Yeah, Cartman, do it!"
1300,Damn! Shit!
1301,Respect my fucking authority!
1302,Yes!
1303,"Hey! You need to watch your mouth, brat!"
1304,Dog shit taco!
1305,"Quick, Satan, do something!"
1306,Try this on for size.
1307,Blooddrenched frozen tampon Popsicle!
1308,"Hey, buddy, I know I was mean before, but don't worry, I can change."
1309,Oh!
1310,Okay.
1311,Not!
1312,"Fuck, shit, cock, ass, titties, boner, bitch, muff, pussy, cock, butthole, Barbra Streisand!"
1313,"What are you waiting for, bitch?"
1314,Destroy him.
1315,"Come on, you weak, stupid comebucket! Save me!"
1316,That's it!
1317,I have had enough of you!
1318,"Hey, guy, relax!"
1319,He spent so much time convincing me I was weak and stupid that I believed it myself.
1320,"I have you to thank, little one."
1321,You showed me that I had to get away from him.
1322,"Just make any wish you want, and I shall grant it."
1323," Are you sure, Kenny?"
1324, What did he say?
1325,He said that his wish is for everything to go back to the way it was before this horrible war.
1326,"Kenny, you realize that means you'd go back, too?"
1327,"Oh! Very well, then."
1328,I will pull all my minions back.
1329,I guess I'm destined to live in hell.
1330,Alone.
1331,Hello. What's this?
1332,"Hi, there, little guy."
1333,Would you like to go to hell with me?
1334,"Sure. I bet we could be best friends, Mr. Satan."
1335,"Feel free to come back and visit us any time you want, Satan."
1336,I just might do that.
1337,"Thank you, Kenny."
1338,"Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us."
1339,You're a real pal.
1340,"Goodbye, you guys."
1341,I'm alive. Where's Mr. Hat?
1342,Wow! We were all dying and now we're fine!
1343,That's super!
1344,What the fuck's going on?
1345,"You see, Mom? After all that, it was Cartman's filthy fucking mouth that saved us all."
1346,"I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to you, Kyle."
1347,"But, Wendy, what about Gregory?"
1348,"Stan, I never really cared for Gregory."
1349, You didn't?
1350," No, dude. Fuck Gregory!"
1351, Fuck him right in the ear!
1352," Yay! Thank you, clitoris."
