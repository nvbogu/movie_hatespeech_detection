7,HOW LONG'S HE BEEN THERE?
8,I DON'T KNOW.
9,WHAT'S GOING ON?

24,"Sweeney: DON'T INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE, MURRAY."
25,"YOU HATE THIS CHILD, AND I THINK I KNOW WHY."
26,Woman: DR. SWEENEY'S OFFICE.
27,I WENT OUT WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW TIMES.
28,THAT WAS 3 YEARS AGO. IT WAS NOTHING.
29,NOTHING. REALLY? HMM.
30,"THAT PAPER... BOB, IT'S A TRAVESTY, ARGUING FOR HITLER AS A CIVIL RIGHTS HERO."
31,YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE.
32,"YOU KNOW, MURRAY, YOU ACTUALLY DID THIS TO YOURSELF."
33,"YOU TOLD THEM THAT THEY COULD DO A REPORT ON ANY BOOK THAT RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, IN PLAIN ENGLISH."
34,"I AM NOT DISPUTING THE FACT THAT THE CHILD IS CONFUSED, AND HE HARBORS SOME SICK IDEAS, BUT I AM NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON HIM YET."
35,HIS BROTHER PROBABLY PUT HIM UP TO IT.
36,I CAN GUARANTEE YOU 100% HIS BROTHER DID NOT PUT HIM UP TO THIS.
37,I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. WHATEVER.
38,"LOOK, I KNOW HE WAS A GOOD KID, AND IT'S A SHAME WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH, BUT THAT IS DANGEROUS."
39,DANGEROUS IN WHAT WAY?
40,THAT GOES TOO FAR.
41,"THIS RACIST PROPAGANDA, THIS MEIN KAMPF PSYCHOBABBL HE LEARNED THIS NONSENSE, MURRAY, AND HE CAN UNLEARN IT, TOO."
42,I WILL NOT GIVE UP ON THIS CHILD YET.
43,I KNEW IT WAS YOU.
44,"Sweeney: DANNY, GET IN HERE."
45,I SAID GET IN HERE!
46,GET IN HERE!
47,SHUT THE DOOR!
48,"WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, DANNY?"
49,WHAT'S WHAT GONNA BE?

58,"DEREK GOT OUT THIS MORNING, DID HE NOT?"
59,"YEAH, HE DID."
60,HE WAS ONE OF MY STUDENTS.
61,"YOU KNEW THAT, RIGHT?"
62,HONORS ENGLISH.
63,HE WAS A BRILLIANT STUDENT...
64,LIKE YOU...
65,"BUT HE HUNG OUT WITH SIMPLEMINDED FOOLS, ALSO LIKE YOU."
66,"LOOK, SWEENEY, DID YOU BRING ME IN HERE TO TALK ABOUT DEREK?"
67,BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.
68,EVERYTHING YOU DO RIGHT NOW HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DEREK.
69,"LOOK, I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS."
70,"I WROTE AN ""A"" PAPER."
71,MEIN KAMPF?
72,I SHOULD EXPEL YOU.
73,GO AHEAD.
74,"WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I COULD HANDLE IT?"
75,NO. I THINK THE STREET WOULD KILL YOU.

77,SO HERE'S THE DRILL.
78,I'M YOUR HISTORY TEACHER FROM NOW ON.

83,ALL RIGHT. YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT IS TO PREPARE FOR ME A NEW PAPER DUE TOMORROW.
84,"OH, COME ON, SWEENEY."
85,IT TOOK ME A WEEK TO READ MEIN KAMPF.
86,THAT ISN'T FAIR.
87,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT ON?"
88,YOUR BROTHER.
89,"OH, GOD, MAN. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING."
90,"NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT KIDDING."
91,I WANT YOU TO ANALYZE AND INTERPRET ALL THE EVENTS SURROUNDING DEREK'S INCARCERATION...
92,HOW THESE EVENTS HELPED SHAPE YOUR PRESENT PERSPECTIVE CONCERNING LIFE IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA.
93,"THE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE, YOUR FAMILY'S."
94,"WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY, DANNY."
95,I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE READING IT.
96,"BUT IF IT'S NOT ON MY DESK TOMORROW MORNING, YOU ARE A GHOST AT VENICE BEACH HIGH."
97,YOU CLEAR?
98,"YEAH, I'M CLEAR."
99,TELLING TEACHER I'M FUCKIN' CHEATIN'!
100,IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?
101,I NEVER CHEATED IN MY LIFE.
102,BEAT HIS MO'FUCKIN' ASS.
103,BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!
104,WHY YOU TRIPPIN' ON ME?
105,NOW WHY YOU ALL KICKING IT LIKE THAT?
106,"WHAT'S UP, MAN?"

110,"WANT SOME, TOO, BITCH?!"
111,"PUNK, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?"
112,YOU WANT TO DIE?
113,PUNKASS WHITE BOY.
114,YOU LUCKY I GOTTA GO TO CLASS.
115,HE AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHING.
116,HE DON'T WANNA SEE ME AND THE HEATER.
117,LUCKY THE BELL RUNG.
118,I WOULD HAVE CLOCKED THAT WHITE BOY.
119,PUNKASS MOTHERFUCKER.
120,SHOULD SMOKE THAT FOOL.
121,YOU GOTTA FUCKING STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.
122,Cop: WE GOT A WHOLE FILE ON SKINHEADS HERE.
123,Second cop: SKINHEADS ALL PART OF THE SAME GANG?
124,VENICE BEACH GANG.
125,"Third cop: ACTUALLY, HE'S DONE A STRETCH AT Y.A."
126,"THIS GUY C.C., IS THAT HIM?"
127,"YEAH, THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE."
128,"THIS MORNING WE HAVE A GUEST COMING IN, AND THERE HE IS."
129,GOOD MORNING.
130,"MORNING, SIR."
131,"GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL."
132,GOOD MORNING.
133,"GENTLEMEN, THIS HERE IS DR. BOB SWEENEY."
134,"HE'S PRINCIPAL OVER AT VENICE BEACH HIGH, AND FOR SOME TIME NOW, HE'S BEEN DOING OUTREACH WORK WITH GANGS BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE CAN."
135,KID NAMED DEREK VINYARD WAS SENT UP FOR MURDERING A COUPLE OF CRIPS WHO WERE TRYING TO JACK HIS CAR.
136,"BOB TAUGHT VINYARD BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE'S FOLLOWED THE CASE KIND OF CLOSELY."
137,"HE WAS A SKINHEAD, RIGHT?"
138,HE WAS MORE LIKE THE SKINHEAD...
139,THE PROTÃ©GÃ© OF CAMERON ALEXANDER.
140,WHO?
141,CAMERON ALEXANDER.
142,HERE YOU GO. HAVE A LOOKSEE.
143,"CAMERON ALEXANDER, WELL..."
144,HE'S A VENICE BEACH LANDMARK.
145,HE'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DISTRIBUTOR AND WRITER OF WHITE POWER LITERATURE AND VIDEOS IN L.A. COUNTY.
146,"HE PROMOTES WHITE POWER BANDS, HE WRITES REVIEWS, AND IN HIS SPARE TIME, THIS GUY EVEN WRITES HATE COLUMNS."
147,DOES HE HAVE A RECORD?
148,HE'S PRETTY CLEAN.
149,"BEEN TRYING TO PIN SOMETHING TO HIM, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK."
150,TRUST ME. HE'S BEHIND ALL OF IT.
151,HE RUNS EVERYTHING OUT OF HIS HOUSE DOWN BY THE BEACH.
152,THERE WERE NO WHITE GANGS IN VENICE BEACH BEFORE CAMERON ALEXANDER AND DEREK VINYARD HOOKED UP.
153,ALEXANDER FOUND IN DEREK HIS SHINING PRINCE.
154,"ESSENTIALLY, HE USED DEREK TO RECRUIT A SLEW OF INSECURE, FRUSTRATED, AND IMPRESSIONABLE KIDS."
155,"THIS KID VINYARD, WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT OF BAGGAGE, AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS TAPE WE'VE GOTTEN COURTESY OF NBC."
156,"EARLIER TODAY, L.A. COUNTY FIREFIGHTER DENNIS VINYARD WAS SHOT AND KILLED BATTLING A BLAZE AT A SUSPECTED COMPTON DRUG DEN."
157,"WE'RE AT THE VINYARD HOME RIGHT NOW, AND LIEUTENANT VINYARD'S OLDEST SON DEREK HAS AGREED TO TALK WITH US FOR A MOMENT."
158,"DEREK, IF YOU COULD COME DOWN HERE PLEASE FOR JUST A SECOND."
159,"LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH, BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW?"
160,HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
161,I THINK IT'S TYPICAL.
162,TYPICAL HOW?
163,"WELL, THIS COUNTRY'S BECOMING A HAVEN FOR CRIMINALS, SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?"
164,DECENT HARDWORKING AMERICANS LIKE MY DAD ARE GETTING RUBBED OUT BY SOCIAL PARASITES.
165,PARASITES?
166,"BLACKS, BROWNS, YELLOW, WHATEVER."
167,I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
168,YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU THINK MAYBE YOUR FATHER'S MURDER WAS RACERELATED?
169,"YEAH, IT'S RACERELATED."
170,EVERY PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY IS RACERELATED.
171,"NOT JUST CRIME. IT'S, LIKE, IMMIGRATION, AIDS, WELFARE..."
172,"THOSE ARE PROBLEMS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY, THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, THE ASIAN COMMUNITY."
173,THEY'RE NOT WHITE PROBLEMS.
174,AREN'T THOSE REALLY ISSUES THAT DEAL MORE WITH POVERTY?
175,"NO. YOU KNOW, NO."
176,THEY'RE NOT PRODUCTS OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.
177,THAT'S CRAP.
178,MINORITIES DON'T GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.
179,"THEY COME HERE TO EXPLOIT IT, NOT TO EMBRACE IT."
180,WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO...
181,"MILLIONS OF WHITE EUROPEANS CAME HERE AND FLOURISHED, YOU KNOW, WITHIN A GENERATION, SO WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH THESE PEOPLE?"
182,THEY HAVE TO GO AROUND SHOOTING AT FIREMEN?
183,WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE MURDER OF YOUR FATHER?
184,BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS MURDERED DOING HIS JOB!
185,PUTTING OUT A FIRE IN A FUCKING NIGGER NEIGHBORHOOD HE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE GIVEN A SHIT ABOUT.
186,HE GOT SHOT BY A FUCKING DRUG DEALER WHO PROBABLY STILL COLLECTS A WELFARE CHECK.
187,THAT'S ENOUGH.
188,DEREK VINYARD WAS QUIETLY RELEASED FROM CHINO EARLY THIS MORNING AFTER SERVING 3 AND SOME ODD YEARS.
189,I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON.
190,"IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM, THINGS COULD GET VERY UGLY DOWN BY THE BEACH."
191,JUST KEEP IT LOW.
192,Danny: VENICE BEACH DIDN'T ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS.
193,IT USED TO BE A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
194,"THE BOARDWALK'S ALWAYS BEEN A DUMP, BUT WHEN MY DAD MOVED US OUT HERE, VENICE WAS A NICE, QUIET PLACE TO GROW UP."
195,"OVER THE YEARS, THOUGH, IT'S JUST GONE TO HELL."
196,THE GANGS ARE LIKE A PLAGUE.
197,"THEY MOVED WEST FROM INGLEWOOD AND SOUTH CENTRAL, AND BASICALLY TOOK OVER."
198,I AIN'T FOULIN' YOU!
199,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
200,I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR ALL THIS BULLSHIT.
201,FUCK Y'ALL.
202,YOU ALL RIGHT?
203,I'M ALL RIGHT.
204,"HEY, YO, IS THAT THAT FOOL YOU WAS TELLING ME ABOUT?"
205,"YEAH, THAT'S THAT MOTHERFUCKER."
206,"YEAH, MAN, THAT'S HIM."
207,BITCH ASS MOTHERFUCKER.
208,Danny: THAT'S WHY DEREK STARTED THE D.O.C.
209,"HE SAID WHITE KIDS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND SCARED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND FOR A WHILE THERE, WE REALLY MADE IT LIKE IT WAS OURS AGAIN."
210,"THROW THE BALL, THROW THE BALL!"
211,"COME ON, CURTIS!"
212,QUIT CHUCKING IT UP. PASS THE BALL.
213,"""D"" UP!"
214,"Cameron: COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO."
215,Derek: LOOK AT THIS FUCKING JUNGLE BUNNY.
216,HE DOES A SPIN MOVE EVERY TIME. EVERY TIME.
217,"YOU AIN'T GETTIN' SHIT, MOTHERFUCKER."
218,YOU AIN'T GETTIN' SHIT.
219,"THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, BOY!"
220,WHAT THE FUCK YOU...
221,"WHO YOU CALLIN' BOY, MOTHERFUCKER?"
222,"YOU'RE LUCKY, MOTHERFUCKER!"
223,I'M THROUGH MONKEYING AROUND WITH YOUR FUCKING ASS!
224,"PALE, PASTY, PASTRAMIEATING, CRACKER MOTHERFUCKER."
225,MAKE YOU MY BITCH.
226,HEAR THAT?
227,HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR HIS CUT IN WELFARE.
228,YOU'RE FUCKING ON!
229,"IT'S 86, SETH."
230,"DANNY, WHEN I WANT YOUR FUCKING OPINION, I'LL ASK FOR IT. COME ON, GUYS. I CAN'T COVER THIS."
231,HELP ME OUT HERE.
232,"YOU GOT A BIG FUCKING MOUTH, SETH."
233,I CAN TAKE THIS NIGLET DOWN.
234,"SETH, YOU COULDN'T TAKE A SHIT."
235,WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?
236,I WILL BEAT HIM.
237,GIVE ME THE MONEY.
238,"SHUT UP, SHUT UP."
239,YOU'RE GONNA FUCKING EMBARRASS US. SHUT UP!
240,I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
241,"Man: YO, I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS."
242,Derek: HEY!
243,I GOT A BET.
244,"I COME IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. SAME SCORE, BUT WE PLAY BLACK GUYS AGAINST THE WHITE GUYS."
245,YEAH?
246,"NAME YOUR PRICE, CRACKER."
247,"NO MONEY, NO MONEY."
248,FOR THESE COURTS.
249,AND NOT JUST TODAY... FOR GOOD.
250,"IF YOU WIN, WE WILL WALK AWAY, BUT IF WE WIN, NO BITCHING, NO FIGHTING."
251,"RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY, YOU PACK UP YOUR SHIT AND GET YOUR BLACK ASSES OUT OF HERE."
252,FUCK THAT. TAKE THIS BET.
253,LET'S GO.
254,YES! WHOO!
255,Derek: PICK HIM UP! PICK HIM UP!
256,"SETH, GET BACK AND PLAY SOME ""D."" DEFENSE!"
257,ALL RIGHT!
258,PASS THE FUCKING BALL! I WAS WIDE OPEN!
259,"Seth: BULLSHIT, MAN."
260,THAT'S FUCKIN' OFFENSE.
261,"MAN, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. HE MOVED HIS FEET."
262,"YOU WANT TO GO, I'M READY!"
263,DON'T BE THROWING FUCKING ELBOWS AT ME!
264,"YOU WANT TO GO, ADOLF HITLER WANNABE MOTHERFUCKER?"
265,YOU OK?
266,YEAH. JUST GIVE ME SOME WATER.
267,"YOU GOTTA CALL OFFENSE ON THAT SHIT, DER."
268,"NOT ON GAME POINT, DANNY."
269,FUCK THAT. YOU CAN'T LET THOSE NIGGERS GET AWAY WITH THAT SHIT.
270,"HONEY, IT'S GAME POINT."
271,"SHUT 'EM DOWN, DEREK. KICK SOME ASS."
272,WATCH THIS.
273,YEAH!
274,BYEBYE.
275,GET THE FUCK OFF MY COURT!
276,THIS IS MY HOUSE!
277,"FUCK YOU, BITCH!"
278,WHOO!
279,YEAH.
280,GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
281,THIS IS MY COURT!
282,YES!
283,Danny: DEREK WOULDN'T LET US VISIT HIM IN PRISON.
284,"HE SAID IT WOULD MAKE IT JUST TOO HARD FOR HIM, AND THAT IF WE CAME, HE WOULDN'T SEE US ANYHOW."
285,"HIM, JUST WONDERING."
286,Danny: AND THEN AT WE PICKED HIM UP OUTSIDE THE GATE.
287,DER.
288,"Danny: THE WHOLE RIDE BACK, HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING."
289,"I WANTED TO STAY HOME, BUT HE SAID, ""NO."
290,GO TO SCHOOL.
291,"I'LL SEE YOU LATER."" OH, COME ON."
292,GIVE THE GUY A BREAK.
293,WHAT'S THE MATTER?
294,"YOU TOO BIG TO GIVE ME A HUG, TOUGH GUY?"
295,"NO, MAN. I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER YOU WHILE YOU ADJUST TO ALL THIS SPACE."
296,"YEAH, RIGHT."
297,THIS PLACE IS SMALLER THAN THE OLD LIVING ROOM.
298,HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S SCHOOL?
299,IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD.
300,"YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT HAIR, MAN."
301,THAT DO'S GOTTA GO.
302,"I DON'T KNOW. THE GIRLS LIKE IT, SO..."
303,"WELL, I DON'T."
304,YOU'RE KEEPING IT PRETTY CLOSE.
305,"YOU TOOK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN, HUH?"
306,"SHIT. LOOK. I FORGOT, MAN."
307,IT HURT LIKE SHIT WHILE THEY WERE PUTTING IT ON.
308,WHEN'D YOU GET THAT?

450,SWEENEY IS A GOOD TEACHER.
451,"YOU CAN LEARN A LOT FROM HIM, SO DON'T GO FUCK IT UP WITH SMALL FRY SHIT LIKE THAT."
452,YOU GOT TO BE SMARTER THAN THAT.
453,"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MAN."
454,YOU GOT TO SEE THE BULLSHIT PAPER HE'S MAKING ME WRITE.
455,I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.
456,HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.
457,I DON'T CARE.
458,AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT.
459,YOU DO ANYTHING HE TELLS YOU TO DO. I MEAN IT.
460,"I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING IN TROUBLE IN SCHOOL TRYING TO IMPRESS ME TAKING THIS SHIT IN THERE, ALL RIGHT?"
461,DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
462,"YEAH, I GUESS, BUT, I MEAN..."
463,I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.
464,"WELL, I'M NOT."
465,SHH.
466,LISTEN TO THAT.
467,"YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE, MAN."
468,"ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."
469,"I'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS LATER, ALL RIGHT?"
470,OK.
471,"HEY, SHE'S COUGHING HER LUNGS OUT, AND YOU'RE BLOWING THIS SHIT IN HER FACE ALL DAY."
472,PUT IT OUT.
473,I'M PUTTING IT OUT.
474,ALL RIGHT. COME ON.
475,HEY...
476,"COME ON, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU."
477,"Ally: MOMMY, ARE YOU OK?"
478,OH.
479,WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT THAT OUT.
480,"I WAS JUST YELLING AT HIM FOR BLOWING SMOKE IN YOUR FACE, AND YOU'RE IN HERE SUCKING ON IT."
481,"NICE THING TO COME HOME TO, HUH?"
482,YEAH.
483,YOU ALL RIGHT?
484,YOU ALL RIGHT?
485,LOOK...
486,"YOU GOT TO TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?"
487,YOU GOT TO GET SOME REST.
488,"I WANT YOU TO TAKE DANNY'S AND MY ROOM, AND WE'LL HIT THE COUCH."
489,NO. I'VE BEEN ON THE COUCH FOR AGES.
490,THE COUCH IS FINE.
491,"NO, IT'S NOT FINE. IT'S NOT."
492,THIS IS TERRIBLE. WE CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.
493,WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
494,Ally: CAN I GO WITH YOU?
495,"YEAH. YEAH, WE ALL GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE."
496,THAT'S THE POINT.
497,I COULD DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND GET A JOB.
498,"NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT."
499,YOU GOT TO FINISH. I'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.
500,"DEREK, CAN WE PLEASE GO EAT?"
501,I'M FUCKING STARVING HERE. I MEAN...
502,I DON'T GIVE A SHIT. GO WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM.
503,I WANT HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE.
504,I KNOW. LOOK...
505,HE'S AN IDIOT.
506,HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN IDIOT.
507,"WHATEVER, DUDE."
508,HE CAN'T HELP IT.
509,I GOT TO DO THAT PAPER.
510,"LOOK, I'M GOING TO CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER TONIGHT AT..."
511,"HEY, HEY, NOT AT CAMERON'S HOUSE."
512,I NEED YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THERE.
513,"BUT WHY, MAN? I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HANG."
514,TRUST ME. I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU LATER.
515,"I JUST NEED YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THE PARTY, ALL RIGHT?"
516,WHATEVER.
517,"HEY, I'M NOT KIDDING."
518,"PROMISE ME YOU'RE GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT PARTY TONIGHT, DANNY."
519,"I'M NOT FUCKING 14 ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?"
520,WHATEVER.
521,GOD!
522,"COME ON, LET'S GO."
523,WHERE ARE YOU PARKED?
524,OUT BACK.
525,"YEAH, THAT'S THE WHOLE BUNCH."
526,"Danny: IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR DEREK TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF, AND CAMERON KNEW JUST HOW TO USE IT."
527,YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO STICK AROUND?
528,"OH, YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO, BUT I GOT TO BE CAREFUL."
529,"YEAH, I KNOW."
530,"I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE, THEN?"
531,RIGHT.
532,ALL RIGHT.
533,GOOD LUCK.
534,Danny: HE SENT DEREK TO THE KIDS...
535,TO THE FRUSTRATED ONES...
536,THE ONES WHO WERE SICK OF GETTING THEIR ASSES KICKED BY BLACK AND MEXICAN GANGS.
537,"""DON'T JUST BE SOME PUNK."
538,"BE PART OF SOMETHING."" Derek: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, LET'S GO."
539,PULL IT TOGETHER.
540,Danny: AND EVERYBODY ATE IT UP.
541,THEY DID WHATEVER DEREK TOLD THEM TO.
542,"HEY, LET'S GO. COME ON."
543,WE'RE NOT HERE TO FUCKING SOCIALIZE.
544,Man: SHUT THE FUCK UP.
545,"Man: YEAH, MAN."
546,Man: YOU WANT A LITTLE TOKE?
547,HUH?
548,GO AHEAD.
549,"CURTIS, WHAT IS THAT?"
550,"AW, COME ON, DEREK."
551,WEED IS FOR NIGGERS.
552,PUT THAT AWAY RIGHT NOW.
553,"AW, JESUS FUCKING CHRIST."
554,HAVE A LITTLE SELFRESPECT.
555,Man: YEAH.
556,"ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP."
557,WE NEED TO OPEN OUR EYES.
558,THERE'S OVER 2 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEDDING DOWN IN THIS STATE TONIGHT.
559,THIS STATE SPENT $3 BILLION LAST YEAR ON SERVICES FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE...
560,$3 BILLION.
561,$400 MILLION JUST TO LOCK UP A BUNCH OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINALS WHO ONLY GOT INTO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THE FUCKING INS DECIDED IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO SCREEN FOR CONVICTED FELONS.
562,WHO GIVES A SHIT?
563,OUR GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.
564,"OUR BORDER POLICY IS A JOKE, SO IS ANYBODY SURPRISED THAT SOUTH OF THE BORDER THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US?"
565,LAUGHING AT OUR LAWS?
566,YEAH.
567,"EVERY NIGHT, THOUSANDS OF THESE PARASITES STREAM ACROSS THE BORDER LIKE SOME FUCKING PIÃ‘ATA EXPLODED."
568,DON'T LAUGH.
569,THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE.
570,THIS IS ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND MINE.
571,"IT'S ABOUT DECENT, HARDWORKING AMERICANS FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND GETTING THE SHAFT BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNMENT CARES MORE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY."
572,"ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IT SAYS, ""GIVE ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR HUNGRY, YOUR POOR."" WELL, IT'S AMERICANS WHO ARE TIRED AND HUNGRY AND POOR, AND I SAY UNTIL YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT, CLOSE THE FUCKING BOOK, BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING."
573,WE'RE LOSING OUR RIGHT TO PURSUE OUR DESTINY.
574,WE'RE LOSING OUR FREEDOM SO THAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING FOREIGNERS CAN COME IN HERE AND EXPLOIT OUR COUNTRY.
575,AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON FAR AWAY.
576,THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING PLACES WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
577,IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE...
578,"RIGHT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT IN THAT BUILDING BEHIND YOU."
579,ARCHIE MILLER RAN THAT GROCERY STORE SINCE WE WERE KIDS HERE.
580,DAVE WORKED THERE.
581,MIKE WORKED THERE.
582,"HE WENT UNDER, AND NOW SOME FUCKING KOREAN OWNS IT, WHO FIRED THESE GUYS AND IS MAKING A KILLING BECAUSE HE HIRED 40 FUCKING BORDER JUMPERS."
583,"I SEE THIS SHIT GOING ON, AND I DON'T SEE ANYBODY DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, AND IT FUCKING PISSES ME OFF."
584,SO LOOK AROUND YOU.
585,THIS ISN'T OUR FUCKING NEIGHBORHOOD.
586,IT'S A BATTLEFIELD.
587,WE'RE ON A BATTLEFIELD TONIGHT.
588,MAKE A DECISION.
589,ARE WE GOING TO STAND ON THE SIDELINES?
590,QUIETLY STANDING THERE WHILE OUR COUNTRY GETS RAPED?
591,Crowd: NO!
592,ARE WE GOING TO ANTE UP AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
593,YEAH!
594,"YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT, WE ARE."
595,AAH!
596,COME HERE!
597,"DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO HIRE FUCKING BORDER JUMPERS, YOU NIP BASTARD?"
598,UHH! UHH! AAH!
599,"HEY, SWEETHEART."
600,"NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T NEED THIS."
601,YOU DON'T NEED THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
602,"PLEASE, PLEASE! NO!"
603,NO!
604,AAH! AAH!
605,YOU FUCKING SPIC!
606,HA!
607,NO! PLEASE!
608,I THINK THIS BITCH DESERVES IT.
609,"OH, MAN, THIS BITCH STINKS."
610,SHE SMELLS LIKE FISH AND CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE.
611,"AH, HERE WE GO."
612,AAH!
613,Man: AAH! AAH!
614,GODDAMN!
615,"Man: GET THE FUCK OFF ME, MOTHERFUCKER!"
616,GO!
617,GET DOWN!
618,UHH!
619,VIVA LA MEXICO!
620,VIVA LA MEXICO!
621,VIVA LA MEXICO!
622,"HAVE A FUCKING BEAN, YOU FUCKING BEANER!"
623,YEAH!
624,YOU FUCKING DOGGY DICK!
625,Man: GET SOME OF THAT IN THERE. MMM.
626,THROW IT ON. THROW IT ON.
627,"HEY, THAT'S A GREAT COLOR ON YOU, YOU KNOW?"
628,"NOW YOU CAN GET A WHITE WOMAN'S JOB, BITCH."
629,"A LITTLE BETTER THAN THIS ONE, HUH?"
630,YEAH.
631,WHITE.
632,"THEN YOU'LL MOVE UP IN THE WORLD, HUH?"
633,YEAH. WHOO!
634,ASSHOLE!
635,UHH!
636,"Derek: COME ON, LET'S GO! WE'RE OUT OF HERE!"
637,EVERYBODY OUT! LET'S GO!
638,NOW! NOW!
639,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! LET'S GO!"
640,COME ON!
641,"COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO."
642,LET'S GO!
643,"NO GREEN CARD, NO FUCKING WORK, COMPRENDE?"
644,"Man: COME ON, COME ON!"
645,"Man: GO, GO, GO!"
646,WE'RE FUCKING GOING! COME ON!
647,"Danny: DAD WAS GONE, BUT THINGS WERE ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN."
648,DEREK HAD A GOOD JOB.
649,MOM WAS STARTING TO LIVE A LITTLE.
650,EVERYONE WAS FEELING SO GOOD THAT WE JUST DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.
651,MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE.
652,THE IRONY IS THAT MOST OF THE STORES THAT WERE DESTROYED DURING THE RIOTS WERE OWNED BY BLACK PEOPLE.
653,"THAT'S STUPID, THOUGH."
654,"I MEAN, WHY TRASH YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD?"
655,"WELL, THAT'S MY POINT."
656,IT'S AN IRRATIONAL ACT.
657,IT'S LIKE AN EXPRESSION OF RAGE BY PEOPLE WHO FEEL NEGLECTED AND TURNED AWAY BY THE SYSTEM.
658,EXACTLY.
659,"I MEAN, IT'S LIKE WE HAD IN WATTS OR THE RIOTS IN CHICAGO IN '68."
660,THAT'S CRAP. I DON'T BUY THAT FOR A MINUTE.
661,CALLING A RIOT AN IRRATIONAL EXPRESSION OF RAGE...
662,THAT'S SUCH A COPOUT.
663,IT'S OPPORTUNISM AT ITS WORST.
664,"IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GRABBING ANY EXCUSE THEY CAN FIND TO GO AND LOOT A STORE, NOTHING MORE."
665,"THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE RIPPED OFF THE STORES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES, ALL THAT REFLECTS IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE PEOPLE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR THE LAW AT ALL AND CERTAINLY NO CONCEPT OF, LIKE, COMMUNITY OR... OR CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY."
666,NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
667,"WHITE PEOPLE COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE, TOO."
668,"YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NOT OFFING EACH OTHER IN RECORD NUMBERS ALL OVER AMERICA."
669,"LOOK AT THE STATISTICS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE."
670,ONE IN EVERY THREE BLACK MALES IS IN SOME PHASE OF A CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM.
671,"IS THAT A COINCIDENCE, OR DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, A RACIAL COMMITMENT TO CRIME?"
672,"WELL, NOT ONLY THAT."
673,THEY'RE PROUD OF IT.
674,MAYBE IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT PREJUDICE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
675,"YEAH. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL STATISTICS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES THAT PRODUCE THEM."
676,"YAP, YAP. YOU KNOW WHAT?"
677,"THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HATE, BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING ONE THING AND CALLING IT SOMETHING ELSE AND JUST, YOU KNOW, ALLEVIATING THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS."
678,"YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SAYING, IT'S NOT A RIOT, IT'S RAGE."
679,"IT'S NOT CRIME, IT'S POVERTY."
680,THAT'S JUST NONSENSE.
681,IT'S BULLSHIT.
682,"IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS TRIAL, TOO, BECAUSE THE MEDIA TWISTED THINGS AROUND SO PEOPLE GOT ALL FOCUSED ON, YOU KNOW, THESE COPS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE GOING TO GET CONVICTED AND WHETHER RODNEY KING'S CIVIL RIGHTS HAD BEEN VIOLATED."
683,EVERYBODY LOST SIGHT OF OLD RODNEY KING HIMSELF.
684,"I MEAN, THE GUY'S A MULTIPLE FELON BY HIS OWN ADMISSION."
685,HE'S HIGH AS A GODDAMN KITE DRIVING 120 MILES AN HOUR DOWN THE HIGHWAY.
686,"HE GETS PULLED OVER BY A BUNCH OF COPS, AND... AND HE ATTACKS THEM."
687,HE ATTACKED POLICE OFFICERS.
688,"THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE, AND HE WALKED."
689,"YEAH, AND THERE'S SOME YAHOO THERE WITH A VIDEO CAMERA WHO TURNED IT ON HALFWAY THROUGH, SO THAT ALL WE SEE IS THEM HITTING HIM."
690,"EXACTLY. YOU GOT POWELL AND KOON WINDING UP AND CRACKING HIM WITH BILLY CLUBS AND BRISENO'S KICKING HIM IN THE BACK OF THE SKULL, SO IT LOOKS SEVERE, YOU KNOW?"
691,"AND PEOPLE ARE GOING, ""OH, THIS POOR GUY."" THIS POOR GUY WHO ATTACKED 4 COPS, AND THOSE COPS END UP ON THE STAND DEFENDING THEMSELVES FOR USING ABSOLUTELY STANDARD TEXTBOOK SELFDEFENSE PROCEDURES."
692,I DON'T THINK THE TAPES SHOWED THAT AT ALL.
693,"OH, YOU DIDN'T THINK SO, HUH?"
694,"AND, WHAT, YOU'RE AN AUTHORITY, MA?"
695,"MURRAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
696,"WELL, I... I DID THINK THAT THE POLICE USED THEIR CLUBS RATHER EXCESSIVELY."
697,WHO ARE YOU TO SAY WHAT'S EXCESSIVE?
698,I THINK IT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.
699,I THINK THEY'RE IN A BETTER POSITION TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT CALL THAN YOU ARE.
700,"IN FACT, WE, AS SOCIETY, GRANT COPS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO MAKE THOSE CALLS, BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEIR JOB IS DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW? UNFORTUNATELY, VERY FEW PEOPLE, LIKE, RESPECT THAT AND RESPECT THAT AUTHORITY."
701,LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT RESPECT... MR. JUNIOR KKK.
702,WHAT?
703,"YOU WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE, DAVINA, YOU SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN."
704,DEREK. DEREK.
705,I ACKNOWLEDGE A COP'S AUTHORITY.
706,I DON'T RESPECT ANY LAWS THAT LET MONKEYS LIKE RODNEY KING BACK ON THE STREET.
707,"SECOND OF ALL, I AM NOT, AS YOU WELL KNOW, A MEMBER OF A LOWRENT, DISORGANIZED BUNCH OF REDNECKS LIKE THE FUCKING KKK. PLEASE."
708,SO TAKE YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS.
709,YOU'VE GOTTEN OFF THE POINT.
710,I HAD A POINT. THAT WASN'T EVEN THE POINT.
711,"DO YOU HAVE ONE? WHAT IS YOUR POINT, DEREK?"
712,"ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT THIS."
713,"IF DANNY HAD BEEN WALKING ACROSS THE STREET THAT NIGHT, AND RODNEY KING HAD PLOWED INTO HIM..."
714,CAN WE JUST DROP THIS RODNEY KING THING?
715,MMHMM.
716,WHO WOULD LIKE SOME DESSERT?
717,WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION.
718,"WE'RE HAVING A NICE DISCUSSION, RIGHT?"
719,"IF RODNEY KING HAD BEEN DRIVING ALONG HOPPED UP ON CHIVAS REGAL AND PCP AND HAD KILLED DANNY, YOU'D BE SINGING A VERY DIFFERENT TUNE..."
720,"I DIDN'T SEE HIM HIT ANYBODY, AND NEITHER DID YOU."
721,"HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO KILL ANYBODY, THANK GOD."
722,"KEEP IT DOWN, OK?"
723,ALLY'S SLEEPING.
724,"IF HE HAD, THOUGH, I MEAN, COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT."
725,"IF THAT FUCKING MONKEY HAD RUN SOME KID OVER, EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT OPINION OF THIS WHOLE MATTER."
726,"YOU KNOW, THEY'D BE FOCUSED ON RODNEY KING AND NOT ON THESE OFFICERS."
727,"BUT INSTEAD, HE JUST ATTACKED A FEW COPS, AND SO, ALL THE SUDDEN, IT'S HANDS ACROSS AMERICA FOR THIS FUCKING TOTAL SON OF A BITCH."
728,"I MEAN, IT BLOWS MY MIND."
729,"WE'RE SO HUNG UP ON THIS NOTION THAT WE HAVE SOME OBLIGATION TO HELP THIS STRUGGLING BLACK MAN, YOU KNOW?"
730,CUT HIM SOME SLACK UNTIL HE CAN OVERCOME THESE HISTORICAL INJUSTICES.
731,IT'S CRAP. THIS STUFF JUST PERPETUATES IT...
732,"ALL THIS LIBERAL NONSENSE, YOU KNOW?"
733,EVERYONE'S TURNING AND LOOKING THE OTHER WAY WHILE OUR COUNTRY ROTS FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
734,"I MEAN, CHRIST, LINCOLN FREED THE SLAVES, WHAT, LIKE, 130 YEARS AGO."
735,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER?
736,"JEWS HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED FOR OVER 5,000 YEARS."
737,ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S WRONG TO FEEL SENSITIVE ABOUT ANTISEMITISM?
738,"Stacey: OH, FORGET THAT."
739,"I'M WITH YOU. I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY, BABY."
740,I'M SO SICK OF THESE LIBERAL HYPOCRITES.
741,"OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN. I LOVE THIS PART."
742,THIS IS GREAT.
743,LOOK AT THE WAY THEY SCAPEGOATED CHIEF GATES.
744,YOU TELL ME THEY WOULD'VE COME DOWN THAT HARD ON BLACK WILLIE WILLIAMS.
745,"NO WAY, BECAUSE THAT VIDEOTAPE WAS A SETUP TO GET RID OF GATES."
746,YES.
747,"NO. NO, YOU CANNOT."
748,DON'T INTERRUPT.
749,EXCUSE ME. I WAS TALKING. I LISTENED TO YOU.
750,WHO DO YOU DON'T THINK YOU ARE? INTERRUPT.
751,SHE'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MAKING A POINT.
752,WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
753,"HEY! DAVINA, SIT DOWN."
754,SIT DOWN! BE QUIET! SHUT UP!
755,SIT DOWN! NO!
756,"DEREK, SHUT UP! CALM DOWN."
757,DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP!
758,SIT YOUR ASS DOWN.
759,NO. SIT DOWN. SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
760,MOVE! NO!
761,"GOD DAMN IT, DEREK! MOVE!"
762,SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND GIVE MY GIRLFRIEND RESPECT.
763,"DEREK, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE?"
764,"MURRAY, STAY OUT OF IT! COME HERE!"
765,"HEY, WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?"
766,"Murray: DEREK, LET HER GO!"
767,"DEREK, LET HER GO!"
768,"YOU NEED TO LEARN SOME FUCKING MANNERS, DAVINA!"
769,SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!
770,SHUT UP!
771,Doris: STOP!
772,SHE CAN'T BREATHE!
773,Derek: UHH!
774,LET HER GO!
775,YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE?
776,ARE YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE?
777,YOU'RE ARE YOU? AN ASSHOLE.
778,AAH! I HATE YOU!
779,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DEREK? THIS IS YOUR FAMILY."
780,"RIGHT. MY FAMILY. MY FAMILY, SO YOU KNOW WHAT?"
781,I DON'T GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE OR WHAT YOU THINK.
782,"YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT, AND YOU NEVER WILL BE."
783,THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
784,"OH, IT DOESN'T?"
785,YOU DON'T THINK I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE?
786,YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SIT HERE AND SMILE WHILE SOME FUCKING KIKE TRIES TO FUCK MY MOTHER?
787,"IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, MURRAY."
788,FUCKING FORGET IT.
789,NOT ON MY WATCH. NOT WHILE I'M IN THIS FAMILY.
790,"I WILL FUCKING CUT YOUR SHYLOCK NOSE OFF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ASS BEFORE I LET THAT HAPPEN, COMING IN HERE AND POISONING MY FAMILY'S DINNER WITH YOUR JEWISH, NIGGERLOVING, HIPPIE BULLSHIT."
791,FUCK YOU.
792,FUCK YOU!
793,"YEAH, WALK OUT."
794,ASSHOLE. FUCKING CABALAREADING MOTHERFUCKER.
795,GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE.
796,YOU SEE THIS? THAT MEANS NOT WELCOME.
797,WHAT DID I DO?
798,"YOU DISGUST ME, YOU KNOW THAT?"
799,YOU DISGUST ME...
800,BRING HIM TO OUR TABLE AND CRIMPING YOUR HAIR AND YOUR DRESS...
801,DON'T WHAT DID I DO? TOUCH ME.
802,WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?
803,HOW COULD YOU BRING HIM TO MY FATHER'S TABLE?
804,HOW COULD YOU GO FROM DAD TO THAT?
805,AREN'T YOU ASHAMED?
806,I'M ASHAMED THAT YOU CAME OUT OF MY BODY!
807,GO RUN TO YOUR FUCKING KIKE!
808,GO RUN TO HIM!
809,IT'S OK.
810,"I'M PROUD OF YOU, BABY."
811,"I'M SO SORRY, DORIS."
812,I REALLY AM.
813,HE'S GONE.
814,HE'S JUST A BOY WITHOUT A FATHER.
815,"DORIS, YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORLD YOUR CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN."
816,GOODBYE.
817,"HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?"
818,"TAKE THIS, YOU FUCKING DICK!"
819,"AAH! NO, NO, NO. COME HERE."
820,FUCK YOU!
821,"DAVINA, CALM DOWN."
822,LET GO OF ME! CALM DOWN.
823,"LET ME GO, GOD DAMN IT!"
824,SORRY. FUCK YOU!
825,I'M SORRY.
826,I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.
827,COME ON. I SCREWED UP. I LOST CONTROL.
828,IT'S NOT YOU.
829,I'M SORRY.
830,COME ON. I'D NEVER HURT YOU GUYS.
831,I'D NEVER HURT YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.
832,I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
833,I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
834,"I TRUST YOU, DEREK."
835,HI.
836,"HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED, HUH?"
837,YOU WANT A PLANE RIDE?
838,YEAH.
839,GOING FOR TAKEOFF.
840,WHOOHOO! WHOO!
841,"Danny: OH, NO."
842,"OH, NO, NO. CRASH."
843,WHOOHOO!
844,BETTER GO TO MOM.
845,"OOH, SHE'S A CRAZY FLIER."
846,KISS MOM.
847,"OH, YEAH."
848,OK.
849,"OH, YOU DON'T FEEL TOO HOT."
850,NO. IT'S MY CHEST.
851,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?"
852,I'M JUST THINKING.
853,YEAH.
854,THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING AROUND.
855,I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE GOT HERE SOMETIMES.
856,MOM...
857,"I FEEL LIKE I LET YOU ALL DOWN, ONLY I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED."
858,"MOM, IT'S OK."
859,YEAH? YEAH.
860,IT'S COLD IN HERE. NO WONDER YOU'RE SICK.
861,NO. YOU DON'T GET SICK FROM THE COLD.
862,YOU GET SICK FROM GERMS.
863,NO. YOU GET SICK FROM SMOKING.
864,YOU OUGHT TO QUIT.
865,IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU.
866,WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT FOR?
867,WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LET THAT BEAUTIFUL HAIR GROW BACK?
868,THE DAY YOU QUIT SMOKING.
869,DEAL.
870,I'D BETTER GET ALLY TO BED.
871,YOU SAY GOOD NIGHT TO MOM?
872,MMHMM.
873,THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO BED.
874,COME ON.
875,"GOOD NIGHT, MAMA."
876,"GOOD NIGHT, BABY."
877,Danny: ALL RIGHT.
878,"GOOD NIGHT, MAMA."
879,Danny: I GO BACK TO THAT NIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MY MIND.
880,I TRY TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.
881,I WANT YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE.
882,THAT'S FINE. I'LL BE GONE IN THE MORNING.
883,Stacey: HE CAN MOVE IN WITH ME.
884,"Danny: IN MY MIND, I IMAGINE WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T GONE TO THAT ROOM AND TOLD HIM."
885,GET DOWN!
886,"NO, DEREK!"
887,"HELP, MOMMY!"
888,AAH!
889,"NIGGER, YOU JUST FUCKED WITH THE WRONG BULL."
890,COME HERE!
891,DAMN! AAH!
892,"YOU SHOULD'VE LEARNED YOUR PLACE ON THE FUCKING BASKETBALL COURT, BUT YOU FUCKING MONKEYS NEVER GET THE MESSAGE!"
893,UHH!
894,"MY FATHER GAVE ME THAT TRUCK, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"
895,YOU EVER SHOOT AT FIREMEN?
896,"YOU COME HERE, YOU SHOOT AT MY FAMILY?"
897,"I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU A REAL LESSON NOW, MOTHERFUCKER."
898,PUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH ON THE CURB.
899,"HOLD ON, MAN."
900,PUT IT ON THE CURB RIGHT NOW!
901,Derek: THAT'S IT.
902,"DEREK, NO!"
903,AAH!
904,NO!
905,NOW SAY GOOD NIGHT.
906,AAH!
907,FUCKER.

910,PUT YOUR HANDS UP!
911,I SAID GET YOUR HANDS UP!
912,NOW TURN AROUND!

1458,USED TO BLAME EVERYBODY.
1459,"BLAMED WHITE PEOPLE, BLAMED SOCIETY, BLAMED GOD."
1460,I DIDN'T GET NO ANSWERS 'CAUSE I WAS ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS.
1461,YOU HAVE TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION.

1504,I JUST HOPED IT'D BE QUICK.
1505,BUT IT NEVER CAME.
1506,"I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT, 'CAUSE I KNEW SOME OF THEM WERE ITCHING FOR IT."
1507,"AFTER AWHILE, JUST PUT MY HEAD DOWN AND READ THE STUFF THAT SWEENEY SENT ME, AND I KEPT TO MYSELF."
1508,LAST 6 MONTHS IN THAT PLACE I WAS LIKE A GHOST.
1509,"WHAT'S UP, MAN? YOU GETTING OUT?"
