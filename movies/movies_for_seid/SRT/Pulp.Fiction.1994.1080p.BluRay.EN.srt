-Did they hurt the little girl?

The point of the story isn't a little girl.

I got something for ya.

945
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:16,338
This watch I got here...

946
01:05:16,423 --> 01:05:21,176
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the First World War.

947
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:25,931
It was bought
in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

948
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,560
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

949
01:05:29,644 --> 01:05:32,563
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

950
01:05:32,647 --> 01:05:35,816
It was bought by
Private Doughboy
Erine Coolidge...

951
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,819
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

952
01:05:38,903 --> 01:05:41,321
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

953
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:44,742
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

954
01:05:44,826 --> 01:05:48,370
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your
great-grandmother,

955
01:05:48,455 --> 01:05:52,875
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

956
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:57,379
<i>until your granddad,
Dane Coolidge, was called
upon by his country...</i>

957
01:05:57,464 --> 01:06:01,175
<i>to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.</i>

958
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:04,720
This time they called it
World War II.

959
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:09,767
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch to your
granddad for good luck.

960
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:12,853
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.

961
01:06:12,937 --> 01:06:15,856
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed,

962
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,943
along with all
the other Marines at
the battle of Wake Island.

963
01:06:20,028 --> 01:06:22,946
Your granddad
was facing death.

964
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:24,948
He knew it.

965
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:28,952
None of those boys had
any illusions about ever
leaving that island alive,

966
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:32,247
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,

967
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:37,544
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki—

968
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:40,547
a man he'd never met before
in his life—

969
01:06:40,632 --> 01:06:43,592
to deliver to his infant son,

970
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:48,263
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

971
01:06:48,348 --> 01:06:52,684
Three days later,
your granddad was dead,
but Winocki kept his word.

972
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:56,980
<i>After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,</i>

973
01:06:57,065 --> 01:07:01,318
<i>delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.</i>

974

This watch.

975
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:14,623
This watch was on your
daddy's wrist when he was
shot down over Hanoi.

976

<i>He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.</i>

977
01:07:18,211 --> 01:07:22,256
<i>He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,</i>

978
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,843
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

979
01:07:25,927 --> 01:07:29,638
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

980
01:07:29,722 --> 01:07:33,642
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

981
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:37,646
so he hid it in one place
he knew he could hide
something— his ass.

982
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,149
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

983
01:07:41,234 --> 01:07:45,404
Then he died of dysentery—
He give me the watch.

984
01:07:45,488 --> 01:07:49,324

hunk of metal up my ass,

Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1668
01:57:51,992 --> 01:57:53,909
I used the same

1669
01:57:53,994 --> 01:57:56,912
and when I finished,
the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxi-pad!

1670
01:57:56,997 --> 01:57:59,915
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1671
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,086
It's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation
to a head, man!

or nothin', all right?

01:59:54,823 --> 01:59:59,493
Now, look, you know,
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

1707
01:59:59,577 --> 02:00:02,204
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1708
02:00:02,288 --> 02:00:05,791
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1709
02:00:05,875 --> 02:00:09,795
Well, then, do it, and then
get the fuck out of my house
before she gets here.

1710
02:00:09,879 --> 02:00:12,798
That's Kool and the Gang.

call my people and
get 'em to bring us in.

1714
02:00:22,058 --> 02:00:25,561
So just do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1715
02:00:25,645 --> 02:00:28,564

1890
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:06,618
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules
of the road straight.

1891
02:11:06,702 --> 02:11:10,246
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's
Truck and Tow.

1892
02:11:10,331 --> 02:11:13,249
Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic
to our dilemma.

1893
02:11:13,334 --> 02:11:15,210
The place is North Hollywood,

1894
02:11:15,294 --> 02:11:19,297
so a few twists and turns
aside, we'll be goin' up
Hollywood Way.

1895
02:11:19,382 --> 02:11:22,717
Now, I'll drive
the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1896
02:11:24,095 --> 02:11:26,054
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1897
02:11:26,138 --> 02:11:29,974
Now, if we come
across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1898
02:11:30,101 --> 02:11:33,186
-nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
-Right.

-Don't do shit unless.

-Unless what?
-Unless you do it first.

1901

How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1903

I don't know why.
I'm cool, I promise you.

1904
02:11:48,828 --> 02:11:51,746
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1905
02:11:51,831 --> 02:11:54,332
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it,

1906
02:11:54,417 --> 02:11:57,293

-Pigs are filthy animals.

'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1944
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:05,588
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1945

I ain't eatin' nothin'

-How about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
-I don't eat dog either.

1947
02:14:14,036 --> 02:14:17,392
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1948
02:14:17,476 --> 02:14:20,395
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1949
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:22,355
but they're definitely dirty.

1950
02:14:22,481 --> 02:14:26,609
-But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
-Ah, so, by that rationale,

1951
02:14:26,694 --> 02:14:30,196
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1952

-Is that true?
-We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

-I don't think qualifies.
<i>-Hey, Vincent.</i>

1965
02:15:19,914 --> 02:15:23,625
Don't you see, that shit don't matter.

the wrong way.

what we experienced...

was an According-to-Hoyle

1970

I felt the touch of God.
