00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:49,956
<i>The world of investing can be a jungle.</i>

2
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>Bulls. Bears.</i>

3
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,169
<i>Danger at every turn.</i>

4
00:00:54,711 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.</i>

5
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:04,846
<i>Trained professionals to guide you

6
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:06,931
<i>Stratton Oakmont.</i>

00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:08,892
<i>Stability.</i>

8
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,685
<i>Integrity.</i>

9
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:12,562
<i>Pride.</i>

10
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>One!</i>

11
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,775
Two!

12
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:19,444
Three!

13
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,453
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

14
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,289
Come on! Let's go!

15
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,958
One!

16
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:35,460
Two!

17
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:37,670
Three!

18
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,298
<i>My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

19
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,591
<i>Not him.</i>

20
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,384
<i>Me. That's right.</i>

21
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,345
<i>I'm a former member of the middle class</i>

22
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:49,307
<i>raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.</i>

23
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:53,061
<i>The year I turned 26,
as the head of my own brokerage firm,</i>

24
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:55,772
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

25
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:59,275
<i>which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.</i>

26
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,573
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

27
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:08,826
<i>like Don Johnson's in</i> Miami Vice.
<i>Not red.</i>

28
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:15,375
<i>See that humongous estate down there?</i>

29
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,793
<i>That's my house.</i>

30
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,419
<i>For millionaires whose ships...</i>

31
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:22,757
<i>My wife, Naomi,
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,</i>

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,968
<i>a former model and Miller Lite girl.</i>

33
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,095
<i>Yeah.</i>

34
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,722
<i>She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.</i>

35
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,350
<i>So put your dick back in your pants.</i>

36
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:35,144
<i>In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,</i>

37
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,105
<i>I own a mansion, private jet,</i>

38
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,815
<i>six cars, three horses,</i>

39
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:42,485
<i>two vacation homes,
and a 170-foot yacht.</i>

40
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:45,405
<i>Anchors aweigh!</i>

41
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:52,161
<i>I also gamble like a degenerate.
I drink like a fish.</i>

42
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:55,039
<i>I fuck hookers maybe
five, six times a week.</i>

43
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,959
<i>I have three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.</i>

44
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:00,712
<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

45
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,218
Okay.

46
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,470
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,389
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:25,069
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

49
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,404
Relax!

50
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,449
Just relax.

51
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:42,587
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,255
Good job.

53
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:46,924
You get in there safe, all right?

54
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,843
Till the next time, brother.

55
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,470
Till next time.

56
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,312
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

57
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:04,817
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

58
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,944
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

59
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:10,515
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day
for my "back pain,"

60
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:12,533
Adderall to stay focused,

61
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,587
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

62
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,632
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

63
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,175
because it's awesome.

64
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,385
Good morning, Nathan.

65
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,644
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

66
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,771
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

67
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,357
You see,

68
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,819
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

69
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,613
Able to conquer the world,

70
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,824
and eviscerate your enemies.

71
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:48,954
And I'm not talking about this.

72
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,956
I'm talking about this.

73
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,837
<i>See, money doesn't
just buy you a better life,</i>

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,423
<i>better food, better cars, better pussy.</i>

75
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,800
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

76
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,471
<i>You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.</i>

77
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,682
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

78
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,689
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

79
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,066
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

80
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,736
<i>and already a money-crazed little shit.</i>

81
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,987
<i>So what do I do?</i>

82
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,407
<i>I go to the one place on Earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions.</i>

83
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,077
I love you.

84
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,716
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

85
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,761
You got a problem with that,

86
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,513
Jordan?

87
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:49,681
No. No problem at all.

88
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,475
Good. Because that is what you are.

89
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:52,935
Pond scum.

90
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,269
Your job is connector,

91
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:58,106
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

92
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,109
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

93
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,153
And until you pass your Series 7,

94
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,447
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

95
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,782
Sit!

96
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:11,203
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

97
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:14,873
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

98
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,583
<i>A million dollars?</i>

99
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,628
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

100
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,631
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,383
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

102
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,052
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

103
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,762
Smile and dial.

104
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,348
And don't pick up
your fucking head until 1:00.

105
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,975
Hey, fuck him.

106
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,686
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

107
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,563
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

108
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,983
Now did you really pitch
a stock in your job interview?

109
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,818
I had to do something
to stand out. Right, sir?

110
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,571
I fucking love that.

111
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,781
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,701
We don't start dialing at 9:30

113
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,662
because our clients
are already answering the phone.

114
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:56,373
Three. Two. One.

115
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,457
Let's fuck!

116
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,128
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

117
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:03,171
<i>Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.</i>

118
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,715
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

119
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,341
<i>"Cunt," "cock," "asshole."</i>

120
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,510
<i>I couldn't believe
how these guys talked to each other.</i>

121
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,886
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

122
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,597
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

123
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,850
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

124
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,227
Yeah. Fuckface, look at
where the stock's at today, huh?

125
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,188
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

126
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,566
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

127
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,487
You are such
a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

128
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,324
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

129
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:33,035
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

130
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,411
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

131
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:37,914
Done!

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,625
Time to paint the tape.

133
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,962
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

134
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,339
Come on.

135
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,092
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

136
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:53,096
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

137
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:54,306
Sold!

138
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:13,742
Yeah.

139
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,000
Tootski?

140
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,503
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

141
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,172
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

142
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,966
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

143
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,511
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

144
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,137
You know how I like them. Straight up.

145
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,848
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

146
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,266
you're gonna bring us two more.

147
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,645
Then two more after that
every five minutes

148
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,939
until one of us passes the fuck out.

149
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,650
Excellent strategy, sir.

150
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,568
I'm good with water for now.

151
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,986
Thank you.

152
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,948
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

153
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,742
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:57,786
Mr. Hanna?

155
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:04,167
You're able to do drugs during the day
and then still function, still do your job?

156
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,086
How the fuck else
would you do this job?

157
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,338
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

158
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,840
Right.

159
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:15,637
Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm. I mean...

160
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,597
The clients you have are absolutely...

161
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,141
Fuck the clients.

162
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,978
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

163
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:25,313
You got a girlfriend?

164
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:26,940
I'm married. I have a wife.

165
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,109
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

166
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,485
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,903
Think about Teresa.

168
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,155
Name of the game.

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,075
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,243
Right.

171
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,995
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

172
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,330
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

173
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,166
No.

174
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,169
Number one rule of Wall Street.

175
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,337
Nobody...

176
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,590
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

177
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:56,303
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

178
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,388
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

179
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,057
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

180
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,518
Fugayzi. It's a fake.

181
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,021
Fugayzi, fugazi,
it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

182
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,440
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

183
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:11,943
It's never landed. It is no matter.
It's not on the elemental chart.

184
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,029
It's not fucking real.

185
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,947
- Right?
- Right.

186
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:17,741
Stay with me.

187
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,118
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

188
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,369
No.

189
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,289
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

190
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:26,792
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,961
He wants to cash in, liquidate,
take his fucking money and run home.

192
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,005
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

193
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,965
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

194
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,300
No. What do you do?

195
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,344
You get another brilliant idea.

196
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,887
A special idea.

197
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,558
Another "situation." Another stock
to reinvest his earnings and then some.

198
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,894
And he will, every single time.

199
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,063
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

200
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,233
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

201
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,985
Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

202
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,154
which he is, on paper.

203
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,906
But you and me, the brokers,

204
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:02,118
we're taking home cold hard cash
via commission, motherfucker.

205
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,912
Right.

206
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:08,583
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.

207
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,126
You should be.

208
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,964
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

209
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,632
First of all...

210
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,678
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:20,887
Do you jerk off?

212
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,015
Do I... Do I jerk off?

213
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,309
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

214
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,686
How many times a week?

215
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,355
Like three or four.

216
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,732
- Three or four times, maybe five.
- Gotta pump those numbers up.

217
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,318
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

218
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:39,072
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

219
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,866
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

220
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,410
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

221
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,870
Really?

222
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,873
I want to. That's not why I do it.

223
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,083
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

224
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:52,669
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

225
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:55,714
All day long, decimal points,
high frequencies.

226
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:56,840
Bang, bang, bang.

227
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,134
Fucking digits.

228
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,637
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

229
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,972
All right?

230
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,558
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

231
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,768
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

232
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,520
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

233
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:11,855
Done.

234
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,607
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

235
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,858
Trust me.

236
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,444
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

237
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,654
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

238
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,031
Or worse yet,

239
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:23,325
I've seen this happen, implode.

240
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,868
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

241
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,119
No. No, you don't.

242
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,454
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

243
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:29,122
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,374
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

245
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,459
When you get really good at it,

246
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,670
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

247
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,842
Second key to success in this racket

248
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,177
is this little baby right here.

249
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,637
It's called cocaine.

250
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,013
Right.

251
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:48,934
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

252
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,393
And guess what?

253
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,020
That's good for me.

254
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,022
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:56,274
Revolutions. You follow?

256
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,442
Revolutions.

257
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,778
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

258
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,406
And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,

259
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,409
every decade, every goddamn century.

260
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:07,911
That's it.

261
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:09,704
The name of the game.

262
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,290
Halkidiki?

263
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,500
Thank you.

264
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,930
Come on.

265
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,062
We're the common denominator.

266
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,155
Keep it up for me.

267
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,157
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

268
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:47,784
<i>And the money comes in</i>

269
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,286
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

270
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,163
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

271
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,832
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

272
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,166
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

273
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:00,463
<i>The next six months,</i>

274
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,882
<i>I got to know the ins
and outs of Wall Street.</i>

275
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,594
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

276
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,810
Oh, fuckers.

277
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:24,696
<i>Then I was a licensed broker at last,</i>

278
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,740
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

279
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:31,411
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

280
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,004
I have Exxon at 86¼ six months ago.

281
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,465
Today it is trading at 36½.

282
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,716
Mr...

283
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,097
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

284
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,390
<i>No shit.</i>

285
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,561
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

286
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,481
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

287
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,940
I know your family, you know mine.

288
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:04,027
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

289
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,445
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

290
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:06,780
Our market's solid.

291
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,490
This is not something
that you want to sell.

292
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,158
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

293
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,534
I think you're making a big mistake.

294
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,036
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

295
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,204
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

296
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,248
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,
trying to get your dirty laundry.

297
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,625
We don't know what's going on here.

298
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,959
I know. I know.

299
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:31,387
Holy

300
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,308
fucking shit!

301
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,728
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

302
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,272
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

303
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,775
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

304
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:48,571
<i>an institution since 1899,
closed its doors.</i>

305
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,074
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

306
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:53,535
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

307
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,207
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

308
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,792
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

309
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,960
If we needed to, I'm saying...

310
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,586
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

311
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,797
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

312
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,257
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

313
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,466
You're gonna be a millionaire.

314
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,052
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

315
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:12,220
We'll find something.

316
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:13,972
- How about this?
- What?

317
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,516
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

318
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,059
Stock boy. What do you think?

319
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,394
You're not gonna work at that place.

320
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,520
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

321
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,688
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

322
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:22,814
- if you go there.
- I know.

323
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:25,108
It's sales. You work your way up,
you'll be a general manager.

324
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,985
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

325
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,736
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

326
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,197
You understand that
nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

327
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,740
You understand that?

328
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,284
Okay?

329
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:41,040
This place is.

330
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,834
- What?
- What's that say?

331
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:44,127
"Stockbrokers."

332
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,880
In Long Island?

333
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:48,548
- Stockbrokers in Long Island?
- Yeah.

334
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,341
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

335
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:12,197
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

336
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,116
What's that? You want to invest?

337
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,286
No. Investor's Center.
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

338
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,040
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

339
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:23,666
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

340
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,752
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

341
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,295
I'm Jordan Belfort.

342
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,631
I'm the broker from
Rothschild in New York.

343
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,799
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

344
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,009
We had a conversation...

345
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,344
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

346
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,762
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

347
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:36,846
Yeah.

348
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:40,975
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

349
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,894
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

350
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,437
You cheap fuck!

351
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,397
So...

352
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,442
So where are your Quotrons here?

353
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,402
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

354
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,779
No, no. We don't even
need computers here.

355
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,572
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

356
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,491
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

357
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,409
You know, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

358
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,661
they don't have enough capital?

359
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:00,870
Their shares trade here.

360
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,664
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,625
This one, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

362
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,085
Or Aerotyne...

363
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,628
Aerotyne, yeah.

364
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,338
Aero... Aerotyne...

365
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:11,798
Aerotyne. Yeah.

366
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,007
Very hot stock right now.

367
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,092
Oh, yeah?

368
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,426
They're just a couple
of brothers that are making

369
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,803
radar detectors out of their garage.

370
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:17,929
They're out in Dubuque.

371
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,264
Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

372
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,765
But you call the company's main line,

373
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:22,642
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

374
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,644
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

375
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,313
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

376
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,940
Six cents a share?

377
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:31,985
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

378
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:33,194
Well, I mean...

379
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,612
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

380
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,698
Postmen, there's always postmen.

381
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,700
Plumbers.

382
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:41,828
They see our ads in the back
of <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Popular Mechanics</i>.

383
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,747
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

384
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,040
- <i>Hustler</i>?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,333
You know, those girlie magazines.

386
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,876
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

387
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,086
- A lot.
- Yeah.

388
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:51,796
We're helping them finance houses,

389
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,798
we're helping them
buy their wife a diamond ring...

390
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:54,924
A boat maybe.

391
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,885
Is this... Is this stuff regulated
or are you guys...

392
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,053
What are you doing here?

393
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:02,932
Sort of.

394
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:04,225
Sort of?

395
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,479
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

396
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,814
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

397
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:10,982
What's your name again?

398
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:12,400
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

399
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,319
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

400
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,405
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

401
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,324
Pink sheets, it's 50.

402
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,578
It's 50%?

403
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,788
50% commission?

404
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,582
- Yup.
- For what?

405
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:29,792
It's our markup for our services.

406
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:32,587
And so if I... If I...

407
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,716
If I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

408
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,344
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

409
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:42,013
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

410
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,475
And I hope it happens.

411
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,103
<i>Hello, John, how are you doing today?</i>

412
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,814
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

413
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:55,735
requesting information on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential

414
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,487
with very little downside risk.

415
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,489
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

416
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay, great.
The reason for the call today, John, is,

417
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,453
something just came
across my desk, John.

418
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,539
It is perhaps the best thing
I've seen in the last six months.

419
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,542
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share
the idea with you. You got a minute?

420
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:12,627
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

421
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,171
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

422
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:18,508
It is a cutting edge
high-tech firm out of the Midwest

423
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,510
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

424
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,137
on the next generation
of radar detectors

425
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:27,642
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

426
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,018
Right now, John,

427
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,562
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

428
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,023
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

429
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,401
it could go a heck
of a lot higher than that.

430
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:42,448
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment
would be upwards of $60,000!

431
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,075
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

432
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,743
Exactly. You could
pay off your mortgage.

433
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,328
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

434
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,498
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market,

435
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:54,085
is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

436
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:57,755
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

437
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,424
And in the case of Aerotyne,

438
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,135
based on every technical factor
out there, John,

439
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:05,346
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

440
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,307
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.</i>

441
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,601
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

442
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,145
Let me lock in that trade right now

443
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,521
and get back to you with my secretary

444
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:15,523
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

445
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:16,858
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

446
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,109
Hey, John.

447
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,236
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

448
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,737
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

449
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:22,947
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

450
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,323
Bye-bye.

451
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:29,370
How'd you fucking do that?

452
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,125
<i>Just like that, I made two grand.</i>

453
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,961
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

454
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,797
Great! Even better!

455
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:43,551
<i>I was selling garbage to garbage men
and making cash hand over fist.</i>

456
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,179
The only problem you're gonna have
is that you didn't buy more.

457
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,891
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

458
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,728
<i>But the way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.</i>

459
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,646
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

460
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,399
<i>Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?</i>

461
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>Yeah.</i>

462
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,944
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

463
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,237
Donnie Azoff.

464
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:04,363
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

465
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:05,740
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

466
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,658
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

467
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,410
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

468
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,287
I think we live in the same building.

469
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,455
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

470
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:14,248
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

471
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:15,458
Fourth floor.

472
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,376
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

473
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,421
What do you do, bro?

474
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,382
What do you mean, what do I do?

475
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,675
For work, what do you do?

476
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,927
I'm a stockbroker.

477
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,762
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

478
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:29,430
Children's furniture.

479
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:30,806
Oh, good for you.

480
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,266
It's all right.

481
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:33,809
You make a lot of money?

482
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,938
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

483
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:38,272
I'm trying to put it together.

484
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,317
You got your fucking nice car,
we live in the same building. I just...

485
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,986
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

486
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,865
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

487
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,742
Get the fuck...

488
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,619
Get the fuck out of here.

489
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:52,954
No, I'm serious.

490
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,288
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

491
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,415
Seriously, how much money do you make?

492
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:58,793
I told you. $70,000.

493
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:01,420
Well, technically, $72,000.

494
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,464
Last month. Something like that.

495
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:06,551
You made 72 grand in one month?

496
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:07,802
Yeah.

497
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,474
I'll tell you what.

498
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,727
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

499
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,146
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

500
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,488
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

501
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,907
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

502
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey, listen, I quit.

503
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,369
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

504
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:36,414
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.</i>

505
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,374
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

506
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:39,792
<i>There were other things about him, too.</i>

507
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,003
<i>Like his phosphorescent white teeth.</i>

508
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,254
Wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

509
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,506
<i>The fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses</i>

510
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,550
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

511
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:50,511
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

512
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,222
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

513
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,766
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

514
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,643
- It's stupid.
- Shit with me?

515
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,895
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

516
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,398
I don't even listen to it half the time.

517
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,066
What are they saying?

518
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,612
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

519
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:08,904
I don't even listen to it.

520
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:11,532
Bro, it's not like that.

521
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:13,075
It's not like that.

522
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,870
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

523
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:17,955
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

524
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,790
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

525
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,501
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

526
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,545
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

527
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

528
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,923
Her... Her father

529
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,676
is the brother of my mom.

530
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,386
It's not like, what... You know.

531
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,013
Look, we grew up together.

532
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,474
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

533
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:38,309
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

534
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,269
And I'm not gonna let someone...

535
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:41,937
You know, one of these assholes
fuck my cousin,

536
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:45,483
so, you know, I used the cousin thing
as like an in with her.

537
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:48,069
I'm not gonna let
someone else fuck my cousin.

538
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,820
You know, if anyone's
gonna fuck my cousin,

539
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:51,781
it's gonna be me,
out of respect. You know?

540
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:52,990
No, I get it. Yeah.

541
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,242
I mean, you're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

542
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,535
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

543
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:57,828
No. We have two kids.

544
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,372
And they're... I mean...

545
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,041
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

546
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:04,251
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

547
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,253
But there's a big chance, right, if...

548
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,673
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

549
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,259
60 to 65% chance the kid's
gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

550
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:13,427
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

551
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:15,846
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

552
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,682
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

553
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:20,518
What if something like that happened?

554
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,186
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

555
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,564
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

556
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:27,316
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

557
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,610
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

558
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,195
You know?

559
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,952
You're completely fucking with me.

560
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:41,956
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

561
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,624
You look like you've... No.

562
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,543
We would take it to, like,
an institution or somewhere

563
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:48,421
that's handled to, like, you know,
raise the kid or whatever.

564
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,048
You know what? If you're happy,
God bless you, buddy.

565
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,468
No, I'm not fucking happy.
No one who's married is fucking happy.

566
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,303
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

567
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,389
Listen, I'm really, you know...

568
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:00,808
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

569
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,059
I'm really enjoying it.

570
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,561
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

571
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:05,938
Actually, I got you a little present.

572
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,440
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

573
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,816
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

574
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:10,151
Yeah. It's in the back though.

575
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,611
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

576
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,989
Like it's wrapped up or something?

577
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:16,574
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

578
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:17,783
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

579
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,326
Let's fucking go. Come on.

580
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,579
Your turn.

581
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

582
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,791
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

583
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,877
No one's fucking here, bro.

584
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,003
Get the fuck...

585
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,880
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

586
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,089
I'm not fucking doing it.

587
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,884
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

588
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,344
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

589
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,346
Fucking nut job.

590
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:03,078
Wow!

591
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,874
Wow.

592
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:11,879
Let's go run, huh?

593
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,089
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

594
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,967
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

595
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:20,471
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

596
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,057
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

597
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:25,142
Let's fucking run! Go!

598
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,602
Go, go, go, go!

599
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,064
<i>You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

600
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,649
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

601
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,734
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

602
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,486
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

603
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,989
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

604
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:41,534
<i>Donnie and I were going out on our own.</i>

605
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,953
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

606
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,955
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

607
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:47,957
<i>So I recruited
some of my hometown boys.</i>

608
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,210
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.</i>

609
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:54,672
<i>Chester, who sold tires and weed.</i>

610
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:57,591
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

611
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,968
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

612
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:01,595
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

613
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:03,097
<i>This is Brad.</i>

614
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,849
<i>And Brad's the guy I really wanted.</i>

615
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,183
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

616
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,811
<i>He was already making
so much money selling Quaaludes,</i>

617
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,647
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

618
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:12,815
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

619
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:13,858
Yeah, man, of course.

620
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:15,860
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

621
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,194
Let 'em watch.

622
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,113
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

623
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:23,200
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

624
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:26,453
Why don't you bring me a pair of
her panties next time you come through.

625
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:29,373
Yeah, man. She said she don't want
to talk to you anymore, man.

626
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:30,666
Get the fuck out of here.

627
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,961
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

628
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,005
Ma!

629
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,674
You listening? It's easier than you think.

630
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,217
Every person you're on the phone with,

631
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,803
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

632
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,054
They all want something for nothing.

633
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,599
There was this one time that
I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

634
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,058
You know those guys
who got like the beard

635
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,185
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

636
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,148
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

637
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:55,733
I don't understand.

638
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:56,984
What's that got to do with anything?

639
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:58,944
What the fuck are you talking about?

640
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,905
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

641
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:04,158
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

642
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,660
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

643
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,079
What the fuck are you talking about?

644
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:11,248
Yeah, like Buddhists.
They don't give a shit about money.

645
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,334
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

646
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,169
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

647
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:18,005
I'm talking about normal people,
working-class, everyday people.

648
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,007
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

649
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,383
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

650
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,344
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

651
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,679
Can we get some ketchup, please?

652
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,139
Do you guys not want to make money?

653
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:28,974
I want to make some money.

654
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,351
I want to make
some fucking money, okay.

655
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:31,769
I can sell anything.

656
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:33,771
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

657
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,773
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

658
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,691
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

659
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,360
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

660
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,111
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

661
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,363
Sell me the pen.

662
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:45,157
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

663
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,618
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

664
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:49,203
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

665
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,829
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

666
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:53,415
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

667
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,500
Why don't you do me a favor.

668
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,251
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

669
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,378
I don't have a pen.

670
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,171
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

671
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:00,339
- Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

672
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:01,799
He's creating urgency.

673
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,342
Get them to want to buy the stock.

674
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:05,302
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

675
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,553
And that's the thing.

676
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,138
All nuns are lesbians.

677
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,140
What the fuck
are you talking about, Otter?

678
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:13,018
Think about it. They can't keep a dude
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

679
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,229
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

680
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,772
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

681
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:18,190
Now she runs.

682
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:21,151
<i>But look. I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

683
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:25,155
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,
took five years to finish high school.</i>

684
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:28,158
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,
didn't even graduate.</i>

685
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,496
<i>Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,
thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

686
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,040
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

687
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,792
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

688
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:40,295
<i>I called him Rugrat
because of his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

689
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:44,216
<i>Still, give them to me
young, hungry and stupid</i>

690
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,344
<i>and in no time, I'll make them rich.</i>

691
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:50,597
Oh, my God.

692
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,141
Jordan, that...

693
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,559
You like it, baby?

694
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,394
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

695
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:57,896
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

696
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,732
but I promise they're really high quality.

697
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,191
It's beautiful.

698
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,193
They're so beautiful.

699
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:04,778
Oh, boy.

700
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,280
What?

701
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:08,866
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

702
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,617
I don't know, it's... You know...

703
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:13,495
These stocks... These companies...

704
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,622
They're like crappy companies.

705
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,999
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

706
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,459
Yeah, they're terrible.

707
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:22,004
Don't worry about it. I told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

708
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,172
Yeah, I know.

709
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,382
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

710
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:28,260
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

711
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:29,762
You know how it goes.

712
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,389
Wouldn't you feel better
if you sold that stuff to rich people

713
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,434
who can, like, afford
to lose all that money?

714
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,644
Of course.

715
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:40,856
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

716
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,816
They just don't.

717
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,485
Why not?

718
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,656
<i>Because they're too smart,
that's why not.</i>

719
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:52,743
<i>I mean, what person
with a college education</i>

720
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,119
<i>would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

721
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,412
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

722
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,580
I got five fucking grand
on the phone right now!

723
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,706
Hey!

724
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,751
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

725
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:04,088
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

726
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,672
<i>Real money.</i>

727
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,925
<i>So I decided to reinvent the company.</i>

728
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,636
Gentlemen, welcome

729
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:13,514
to Stratton Oakmont.

730
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:18,685
You schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

731
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,813
We're talking about whales here.

732
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:22,773
Moby fucking Dicks.

733
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:27,069
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

734
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

735
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,990
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

736
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,700
Get it? Huh?

737
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,160
Captain who?

738
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,662
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

739
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:40,332
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

740
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:42,417
Turn your fucking brain on.

741
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,002
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

742
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:46,922
Listen to me.
We're a new company with a new name.

743
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,175
A company that
our clients can believe in.

744
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:53,178
A company that our clients can trust.

745
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:57,808
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

746
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:01,311
that our very founders
sailed over on the <i>Mayflower</i>

747
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,230
and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont

748
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,607
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

749
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,984
You got it?

750
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,236
What we're gonna do is this.

751
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:14,491
First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM,
blue chip stocks exclusively.

752
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,743
Companies these people know.

753
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,873
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

754
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:24,668
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,
where we make the money.

755
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,920
50% commission, baby.

756
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:30,007
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

757
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,093
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

758
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,096
Because by the time you read about it
in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

759
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,056
It's already too late.

760
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,267
Then you wait.

761
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,435
You wait.

762
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,104
And whoever speaks first loses.

763
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:47,357
<i>Sorry.</i>

764
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:48,942
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

765
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:53,238
<i>I really have to give this some thought
and talk to my wife about it.</i>

766
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,656
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

767
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,033
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

768
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,493
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

769
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:00,370
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

770
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:03,957
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

771
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,667
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

772
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,502
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

773
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,297
So, what do you say?

774
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,550
You mean to tell me that if I put you in
at Union Carbide at 7

775
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,052
and took you out at 32...

776
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:17,721
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

777
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:20,265
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41

778
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,017
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester",

779
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,894
"pick me up
a few thousand shares of Disney"

780
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:26,104
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

781
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:27,522
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

782
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,941
<i>I don't know you.</i>

783
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,318
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

784
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,238
I am in complete agreement with you.
You don't know me, I don't know you.

785
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:36,949
Let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

786
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:38,367
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

787
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:40,285
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

788
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,787
and I plan on being one of the...

789
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,164
top brokers in my firm next year.

790
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,166
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

791
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,252
<i>I do wanna say that you sound like a...</i>

792
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,087
<i>You sound like a pretty sincere guy.</i>

793
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,422
<i>It's not gonna make you rich
and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

794
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:54,967
But what this trade will do is serve as...

795
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,302
a benchmark for future business, Kevin.

796
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,221
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

797
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,597
And then you'll know for sure

798
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,724
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

799
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:04,351
that you can trust,

800
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:08,021
and who can consistently
make you money.

801
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:09,523
Sound fair enough?

802
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,527
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

803
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,488
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

804
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,324
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

805
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,492
Kevin.

806
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,953
You give me one shot here

807
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:25,664
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

808
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,958
and believe me, Kevin,

809
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,544
the only problem you're gonna have

810
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:33,046
is that you didn't buy more.

811
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:34,715
Sound fair enough?

812
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,259
<i>Shit. My...</i>

813
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,806
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

814
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,057
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

815
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,144
Excellent choice, Kevin.

816
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,062
How much do you
want to go for this time?

817
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,106
<i>Let's do five... $5,000.</i>

818
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:52,357
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

819
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,775
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

820
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,152
- Ten.
<i>- You want to do that?</i>

821
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,236
Excellent choice!

822
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,114
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you in a few minutes

823
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:00,490
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

824
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,160
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

825
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,412
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

826
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:06,621
<i>This is fun.</i>

827
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,914
Take it easy, Kev.

828
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

829
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,586
Fuck that motherfucker!

830
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,546
That's what I'm talking about!

831
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,301
What a fucking idiot.

832
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:22,846
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

833
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,308
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

834
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:27,517
Get in now or...

835
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,353
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

836
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,938
and I'm a Senior Vice President
with Stratton Oakmont.

837
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:36,151
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

838
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,694
When did he pass?

839
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,779
Just say I'm wrong, right.

840
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:39,905
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

841
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,490
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

842
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:44,368
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

843
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,577
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

844
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,287
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

845
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:49,122
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

846
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,665
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

847
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,794
That's a very intelligent decision.

848
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:55,504
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

849
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:57,464
Rhonda!

850
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,466
- Rhonda!
- Put you through to Andrea.

851
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,176
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

852
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,059
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

853
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:10,185
Yeah!

854
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:12,687
<i>The end of the month.</i>

855
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,191
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

856
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:19,569
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

857
00:37:20,904 --> 00:37:23,907
<i>And to celebrate with
our weekly act of debauchery,</i>

858
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,742
<i>I have offered
our lovely sales assistant,</i>

859
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,744
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

860
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,581
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

861
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:33,375
Yeah!

862
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,336
Yeah, you want this?

863
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,504
You want this?

864
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,006
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

865
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,426
Let the scalping begin!

866
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,472
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

867
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:54,688
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised
to use this $10,000 for breast implants!</i>

868
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:58,191
<i>She's already got C cups,
but now she wants fucking double D's!</i>

869
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:01,027
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

870
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:06,241
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

871
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,662
<i>Donnie!</i>

872
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:14,207
<i>Blow the roof off this motherfucker!</i>

873
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:44,446
Champagne?

874
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:50,827
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

875
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,279
Mine!

876
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:44,965
<i>Word about us spread
throughout Wall Street.</i>

877
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:47,342
<i>Even the places I didn't want it to.</i>

878
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,020
<i>It wasn't long before</i> Forbes <i>magazine,</i>

879
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:01,898
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.</i>

880
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,277
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

881
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,528
One word?

882
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:10,740
Diversification.

883
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,117
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

884
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,201
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

885
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,286
Can we get a quick picture?

886
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,873
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i>

887
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:21,126
<i>This conniving little twat! Look at this!</i>

888
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,379
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

889
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:25,422
Your hair looks good.

890
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:26,923
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

891
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:31,136
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like
a kind of twisted Robin Hood"

892
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:33,847
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself"

893
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,724
"and his merry little band of brokers."

894
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,642
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

895
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,104
There is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweetheart.

896
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,689
Read the article, babe.

897
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,233
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

898
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:46,901
Big fucking deal I look great.

899
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,529
Mr. Belfort! Can you
look at my resume, please?

900
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,531
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

901
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:55,410
Calm the fuck down!

902
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:57,287
What the hell's all this?

903
00:40:57,495 --> 00:41:00,206
It's the <i>Forbes</i> article.
They all want to work for you now.

904
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:01,458
Hey! What did I say?

905
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,709
I'm just trying to be nice.

906
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,629
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

907
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,005
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

908
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,716
Forbes <i>made me a superstar.</i>

909
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:15,764
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

910
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,768
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

911
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:23,980
<i>and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.</i>

912
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,607
Are you fucking serious right now?

913
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:29,778
<i>I mean, we were literally
putting clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

914
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:32,864
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

915
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,117
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

916
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:39,579
<i>there's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

917
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:44,918
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.</i>

918
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,593
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

919
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,261
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

920
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:59,265
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

921
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,809
Yes!

922
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,438
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

923
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,440
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

924
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:10,193
<i>But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.</i>

925
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:13,321
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

926
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,864
<i>when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

927
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,075
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

928
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:18,702
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

929
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:20,662
<i>Her name was Pam, and to her credit,</i>

930
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:25,792
<i>she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild twist and jerk motion.</i>

931
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,293
<i>About a month later,</i>

932
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,295
<i>Donnie and I decided to double-team her</i>

933
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:30,547
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

934
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,383
<i>while our wives were out
shopping for Christmas dresses.</i>

935
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,051
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

936
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,595
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

937
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,973
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

938
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:43,309
<i>Then he got depressed
and killed himself three years later.</i>

939
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,856
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

940
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:49,607
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

941
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:54,487
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

942
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:58,491
<i>which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.</i>

943
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:02,287
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

944
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,998
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

945
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:07,250
God damn it!

946
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,376
You're gonna miss it!

947
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,295
Please, tell me something I don't know.

948
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:13,131
I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

949
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,508
and they have to fucking... Hello.

950
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,302
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

951
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:18,678
Gene. How are you, Gene?

952
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:20,722
<i>He'd affect this weird British accent.</i>

953
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:23,016
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

954
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:24,309
Cheerio.

955
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:25,435
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

956
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:27,061
The fucking halfwit!

957
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:28,188
<i>- He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

958
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:30,523
<i>And then he's Mad Max all over again.</i>

959
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:31,649
Damn it!

960
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,943
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

961
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,154
Well, he discovered
it was the mother's sister.

962
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:37,655
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

963
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:39,324
The main guy.
You know who the main...

964
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:40,492
The main guy...

965
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:42,911
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

966
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,955
<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know</i>

967
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:47,707
<i>everything we were doing at Stratton.</i>

968
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,834
And then there's a big target and we...

969
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:51,878
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

970
00:43:52,003 --> 00:43:54,088
<i>There's a bull's-eye and
the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

971
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:55,256
<i>Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign</i>

972
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,299
gets the most points.

973
00:43:56,382 --> 00:43:58,593
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

974
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:00,595
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

975
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:01,971
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

976
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:03,306
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

977
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,141
They got like superhuman strength.

978
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,434
I think he's gonna be fine.

979
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,478
You can't look him right in the eyes.

980
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:09,687
You can't look him in the eye?

981
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:11,439
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

982
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:13,399
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

983
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:15,026
You gotta look at their chin.

984
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:16,152
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

985
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,237
but I'm looking at your chin.

986
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,489
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

987
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:21,449
They're like the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

988
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,076
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

989
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,369
And they lock in.

990
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:27,080
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

991
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:28,289
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

992
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:29,791
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

993
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:31,334
Any food. Correct.

994
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,460
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

995
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,295
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

996
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,089
and like get some
of the girls to, you know,

997
00:44:36,214 --> 00:44:37,257
fondle him and shit like that.

998
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,341
That would be... That's unacceptable?

999
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:39,425
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1000
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:41,511
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1001
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:42,595
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1002
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,055
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1003
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:46,182
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1004
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,475
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1005
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,560
So they're built for accuracy.

1006
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,603
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1007
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,771
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1008
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,189
His brother's the bowling ball.

1009
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,983
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1010
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:56,359
you strap him to a skateboard,

1011
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,819
you toss him down
an alley at some pins.

1012
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:59,529
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1013
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:01,614
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1014
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,783
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1015
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,118
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1016
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,494
They are very ornery by the way,

1017
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,954
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1018
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:09,080
Safety first.

1019
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:10,248
Safety is first, all right?

1020
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,208
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1021
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,918
ready to knock this fucker out.

1022
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,170
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1023
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,255
A pellet gun maybe?

1024
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,464
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1025
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:19,883
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1026
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:22,552
But I say we stick with the loophole.
Right? Okay?

1027
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:24,554
If we don't consider him a human,

1028
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:26,764
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1029
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:27,891
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1030
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:29,934
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1031
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,769
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1032
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,688
is that these things gossip.

1033
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:35,398
They get together and they gossip.

1034
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:36,858
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1035
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:39,110
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1036
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,778
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1037
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,447
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1038
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,616
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1039
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,702
When they come in,
we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1040
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:51,080
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1041
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:52,749
We accept them, one of us!

1042
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,542
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1043
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:55,960
We accept them, one of us.

1044
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,086
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1045
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,463
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1046
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:00,006
Something about
the American Express bill.

1047
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:01,257
Can you get him out of here?

1048
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:02,508
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1049
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:03,843
No, I'm serious!

1050
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:06,262
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1051
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,805
You got any fucking stock forms?

1052
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:09,432
He's coming, he's coming.

1053
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,683
Make some shit up.

1054
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:12,769
I think if we short Pfizer...

1055
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:17,774
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1056
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:23,196
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1057
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,448
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1058
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:26,741
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1059
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:28,242
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1060
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:32,205
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1061
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,998
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1062
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,501
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1063
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,461
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1064
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,797
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1065
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,382
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1066
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,425
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1067
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:47,971
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1068
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,390
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1069
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:52,350
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1070
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,851
That's why they were expensive.

1071
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:55,853
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1072
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,939
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1073
00:46:58,022 --> 00:46:59,816
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1074
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:02,652
Well, that's...

1075
00:47:02,735 --> 00:47:03,820
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1076
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:04,988
How do I describe this?

1077
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,072
Jord, what is that?

1078
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:08,241
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1079
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:10,410
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1080
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:12,495
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1081
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:15,164
That is what it is.
But none of these were charged to me.

1082
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:16,582
This is all of them.

1083
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,459
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1084
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:20,378
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1085
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:23,423
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1086
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,675
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1087
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:26,926
T&E!

1088
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,094
T&E!

1089
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,220
Yeah. I said T&E.

1090
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:30,596
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1091
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,681
Yeah, you did.

1092
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:34,058
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1093
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,435
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1094
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:39,814
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1095
00:47:39,897 --> 00:47:41,524
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1096
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:42,900
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1097
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,360
Absolutely, no question.

1098
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,570
I'm trying to...

1099
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:46,696
I'm getting this close!

1100
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:47,989
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1101
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,533
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1102
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:51,659
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1103
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,286
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1104
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,079
Max, why do you hold it in?

1105
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,873
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1106
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:59,292
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1107
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,461
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1108
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:02,587
A rich one.

1109
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,006
<i>At Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.</i>

1110
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:07,383
<i>The Blue Chips, top of
the line, model material.</i>

1111
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,968
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1112
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,846
<i>and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1113
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,806
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1114
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:17,518
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1115
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:19,937
<i>They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1116
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,482
<i>Finally, there were
the Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1117
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:25,485
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1118
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:26,819
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1119
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,280
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

1120
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:31,199
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1121
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,117
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1122
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:35,995
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1123
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,498
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1124
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,333
with EJ Entertainment.

1125
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,417
Pops.

1126
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,835
How are things at home?

1127
00:48:43,002 --> 00:48:44,504
Well, not the best.

1128
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:47,131
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1129
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,716
It's like the smell...

1130
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,384
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1131
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,054
After a while it kind of
fades away a little bit.

1132
00:48:53,137 --> 00:48:54,806
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1133
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,808
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1134
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,519
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1135
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:00,770
What do you think? We're...

1136
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,688
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1137
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:04,148
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1138
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:06,400
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1139
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:07,819
It's crazy out there.

1140
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:09,403
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1141
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:10,738
Oh, my God!

1142
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:12,448
They're fucking...

1143
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,408
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1144
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,828
I mean... I mean, it's on
a whole other level.

1145
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,496
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1146
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,039
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1147
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,541
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1148
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:23,835
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1149
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:25,920
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1150
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,632
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1151
00:49:29,715 --> 00:49:30,800
It's a new world.

1152
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:32,802
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1153
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:35,346
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1154
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,764
Wow. A new world.

1155
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,892
I was born too... Too early.

1156
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:42,186
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

1157
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:43,604
- Really?
- Yeah.

1158
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:44,772
I don't mind it.

1159
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,274
Dad.

1160
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:48,734
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1161
00:49:48,901 --> 00:49:50,069
How can I not get stressed out?

1162
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,529
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1163
00:49:51,612 --> 00:49:52,822
I know they're knuckleheads

1164
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:55,116
but I need them to want
to live like me, you get it?

1165
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:56,576
To live like me.

1166
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:58,035
Jordy.

1167
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,873
One of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

1168
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,668
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1169
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,130
Crazy? This is obscene.

1170
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:10,756
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1171
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,466
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1172
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,969
<i>But who the fuck wanted to live there?</i>

1173
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:18,806
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1174
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,771
<i>We are about to become fucking legends</i>

1175
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,732
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1176
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:32,320
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1177
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:35,364
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1178
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,119
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1179
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,917
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1180
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:48,544
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1181
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,795
This way we become the underwriters.

1182
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:51,422
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1183
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:55,092
<i>Finding companies to take public. IPOs.</i>

1184
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:56,969
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1185
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:00,765
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

1186
00:51:00,848 --> 00:51:02,058
We got Arncliffe International.

1187
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,684
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1188
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:07,355
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1189
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:09,899
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1190
00:51:09,982 --> 00:51:12,985
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1191
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:15,154
Steve Madden.

1192
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,823
We own the fucking companies...

1193
00:51:18,532 --> 00:51:19,700
We own the companies...

1194
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:21,702
<i>Don't know what a lude is?
I'll tell you.</i>

1195
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,829
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1196
00:51:23,996 --> 00:51:28,668
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1197
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:03,452
<i>The Quaalude,</i>

1198
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:06,455
<i>or lude, as it is commonly referred to,</i>

1199
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:09,041
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1200
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,794
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1201
00:52:11,877 --> 00:52:13,296
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1202
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:17,216
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1203
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:20,136
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1204
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:23,973
<i>that if you resisted the urge to sleep
for just 15 minutes,</i>

1205
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:26,392
<i>you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.</i>

1206
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:30,396
<i>Didn't take long for people
to start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1207
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:33,649
<i>And in 1982,
the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1208
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:35,901
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1209
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:39,280
<i>Which meant there was
only a finite amount of these things left.</i>

1210
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:42,325
<i>No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1211
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,910
<i>You people are all shit out of luck.</i>

1212
00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:46,495
What are you saying? What is it?

1213
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,747
Steve Madden.

1214
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:49,749
Steve Madden.

1215
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,125
Steve.

1216
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,376
Steve.

1217
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:54,128
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1218
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:56,589
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1219
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,299
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1220
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:00,593
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1221
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:02,053
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1222
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:04,930
<i>Steve Madden was the name
in women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1223
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:08,726
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1224
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,061
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1225
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:11,437
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1226
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,314
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1227
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:15,941
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1228
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,610
Women's shoes!

1229
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:19,779
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

1230
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,448
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1231
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:23,866
Steve.

1232
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:25,034
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1233
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:26,285
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1234
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,120
Look at this. Look.

1235
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,087
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1236
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,631
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1237
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:41,425
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1238
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,887
She's hot.

1239
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:46,722
Cristy.

1240
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,687
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1241
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,357
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1242
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,983
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1243
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,819
You got an awesome place here.

1244
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:02,238
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1245
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:03,489
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1246
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:04,782
Beautiful beach out there.

1247
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,033
Blair Hollingsworth.

1248
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:08,327
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1249
00:54:08,702 --> 00:54:10,037
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1250
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:11,414
You like to Jet Ski?

1251
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,082
I've never done it before.

1252
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:14,166
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1253
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,251
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1254
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,752
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1255
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,003
How many times are you gonna ask her?

1256
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,463
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1257
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:22,174
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1258
00:54:22,466 --> 00:54:24,844
Okay. Sure.

1259
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,763
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1260
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,849
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1261
00:54:30,057 --> 00:54:31,350
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1262
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,768
Just tell her I'll be
out in a couple of minutes.

1263
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,311
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1264
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:35,396
I might do that, but I'm having

1265
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:37,022
a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1266
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:38,941
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1267
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:40,192
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1268
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:41,735
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1269
00:54:41,902 --> 00:54:43,487
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1270
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:45,865
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1271
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,116
But we can stay for a drink...

1272
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,367
She's...

1273
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,202
perfect.

1274
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:51,829
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1275
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:52,955
She's perfect.

1276
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:54,415
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1277
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,208
You piece of...

1278
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:06,510
You're gonna have
to excuse my friend. He gets...

1279
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:07,970
Get the fuck out!

1280
00:55:08,053 --> 00:55:10,097
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1281
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:11,265
Yeah, Donnie!

1282
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:14,351
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1283
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,061
That's fucking rude.

1284
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:17,980
Have some fucking manners.

1285
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:23,944
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1286
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:26,363
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1287
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,032
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.

1288
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,658
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1289
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:32,036
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1290
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:33,204
Right.

1291
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:34,914
So I presume you're Italian?

1292
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:36,207
On my dad's side.

1293
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,502
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1294
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,086
I'm a mutt.

1295
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,588
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1296
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,007
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1297
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,801
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1298
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:50,846
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1299
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,264
That explains it then.

1300
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,349
Explains what?

1301
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:56,227
It explains you. I mean,
you're a duchess, right?

1302
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,729
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1303
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,858
Excuse me.

1304
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,944
Could I get a straw, please?

1305
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,571
Thank you.

1306
00:56:10,574 --> 00:56:15,829
So I was a little surprised
you asked Cristy for my number.

1307
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:18,165
Why is that?

1308
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,877
Aren't you married?

1309
00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:25,422
Well... Yeah, but what?

1310
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:27,591
Married people can't have friends?

1311
00:56:29,468 --> 00:56:31,262
We're gonna be friends?

1312
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:35,558
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1313
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:41,730
We're not gonna be friends.

1314
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,449
And at night I work on my designs.

1315
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,244
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1316
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:58,205
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1317
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,625
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1318
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,419
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1319
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:16,390
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1320
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,981
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1321
00:57:25,357 --> 00:57:26,942
Tea? Yeah.

1322
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:28,944
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1323
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,321
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1324
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,698
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted
to come up for tea.</i>

1325
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,743
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1326
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:36,952
Sure.

1327
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,370
This is Rocky.

1328
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,664
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1329
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:41,999
Hi, sweetheart.

1330
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,375
Okay.

1331
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,545
Why don't you light a fire or something
and I'll be right out.

1332
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:48,922
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1333
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,886
I like your painting here. It's...

1334
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,646
<i>God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1335
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:08,275
You all right?

1336
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,694
Yeah, yeah. Just trying
to light the fire here.

1337
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:17,910
<i>That's it. That's it, you're leaving.</i>

1338
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,870
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1339
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,674
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1340
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,301
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1341
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,136
Jesus Lord!

1342
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:40,599
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1343
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:52,986
Did you just come?

1344
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,030
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1345
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:57,408
Did you? Did you come?

1346
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:59,201
- No.
- No?

1347
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:00,369
Okay.

1348
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:02,621
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1349
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:05,124
Sure.

1350
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,042
Come on, baby, come on.

1351
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,755
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1352
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:19,012
Oh, God!

1353
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:21,014
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1354
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:22,516
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1355
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,684
It's okay.

1356
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:25,227
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1357
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,187
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1358
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:31,066
You're crazy.

1359
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,401
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1360
00:59:32,484 --> 00:59:34,820
<i>I mean, her pussy
was like heroin to me.</i>

1361
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:37,656
<i>And it wasn't just about the sex, either.</i>

1362
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,742
<i>Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...</i>

1363
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,660
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

1364
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,625
<i>Choc-choc tram.</i>

1365
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,002
Yeah.

1366
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:00,888
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1367
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:10,189
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1368
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:13,400
Oh, shit!

1369
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:25,162
You!

1370
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:27,289
Get out of the fucking car!

1371
01:00:27,664 --> 01:00:28,707
Jesus Christ.

1372
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,376
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1373
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,463
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1374
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:37,257
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1375
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,634
Okay, babe, stop!

1376
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:39,843
Please.

1377
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,011
Bitch!

1378
01:00:41,762 --> 01:00:43,388
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1379
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:44,973
Jesus Christ!

1380
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:46,141
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1381
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,476
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1382
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:48,894
I didn't know you were here!

1383
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:50,521
That's where you've fucking been?

1384
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:52,314
With that fucking whore from the party?

1385
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:53,816
I thought you were at the beach house.

1386
01:00:53,899 --> 01:00:55,275
How could you do this to me?

1387
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,153
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1388
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,989
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1389
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:04,201
I made a mistake.
I don't know what to tell you, babe. I...

1390
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:05,911
I'm sorry.

1391
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:08,872
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1392
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:20,425
Do you love her?

1393
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:27,558
Answer me.

1394
01:01:49,162 --> 01:01:51,206
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1395
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:54,042
<i>Three days later, I filed for a divorce</i>

1396
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:55,878
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

1397
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:03,886
<i>Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1398
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:07,097
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1399
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,558
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1400
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:12,227
<i>This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.</i>

1401
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,896
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1402
01:02:14,146 --> 01:02:15,314
Is that jasmine?

1403
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:18,317
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1404
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,277
Very good. Great nose.

1405
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,029
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

1406
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:28,702
Oh, my God!

1407
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,663
Oh, hey.

1408
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,415
Is it Wednesday already?

1409
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:35,626
Oh, don't stop.

1410
01:02:35,709 --> 01:02:36,793
What the fuck!

1411
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:39,004
That is fucked up!

1412
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:40,672
He must have thought we were still

1413
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:42,341
at the Hamptons this weekend, you know.

1414
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:43,800
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1415
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:46,553
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1416
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,888
There were more over here.

1417
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:49,431
There were four right here.

1418
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:51,183
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1419
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:54,102
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1420
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:58,148
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1421
01:02:58,273 --> 01:02:59,358
Right. What?

1422
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:01,526
What is it, babe? What?

1423
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,945
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1424
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,029
I don't know where your money...

1425
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,114
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1426
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:08,158
I don't know where
your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1427
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:10,494
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1428
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:11,870
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1429
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,121
Let's start from the beginning.

1430
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:14,456
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1431
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:16,083
You invited some friends over, right?

1432
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,043
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1433
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,628
We understand that, we do.

1434
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,130
We do blow all the time.
We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1435
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:23,298
Look at us, right?

1436
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,967
But money was stolen from my apartment.

1437
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,635
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1438
01:03:26,718 --> 01:03:28,804
Like I said, I don't know
where your money is.

1439
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:30,263
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1440
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:31,390
It was just a normal day.

1441
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,808
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1442
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:35,143
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1443
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,145
I got a little high at breakfast.

1444
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:39,022
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1445
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,107
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1446
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,025
And then I said,
"Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1447
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,568
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1448
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:46,113
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1449
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:50,993
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1450
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:52,202
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1451
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:53,328
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1452
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,496
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1453
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:56,039
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1454
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,541
You know who Rudy is?

1455
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,627
I don't fucking know any...

1456
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,670
What do you mean?

1457
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:02,838
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1458
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:04,506
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1459
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:06,174
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1460
01:04:06,258 --> 01:04:08,260
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1461
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:09,886
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1462
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,596
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1463
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:13,348
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1464
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,641
from my fucking sock drawer!

1465
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,226
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1466
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:18,228
- Where the fuck is it?
- Rudy. What the fuck?

1467
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:20,355
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1468
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,107
Did he? Answer me!

1469
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,693
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1470
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:25,986
This is a gay thing.

1471
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:27,654
See, all of you...

1472
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:29,281
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1473
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:31,408
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1474
01:04:31,491 --> 01:04:33,869
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1475
01:04:33,952 --> 01:04:35,078
You were in charge, right?

1476
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,872
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1477
01:04:36,955 --> 01:04:39,124
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1478
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,835
He should've hired a fucking Mexican
like I have in my fucking house.

1479
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:45,047
Shit! What the fuck...

1480
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:50,635
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1481
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:51,845
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1482
01:04:51,928 --> 01:04:53,096
Where is it?

1483
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:56,308
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1484
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:57,476
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1485
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:58,602
I don't know!

1486
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:02,314
<i>I had to call the cops just to keep
them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1487
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:06,026
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.</i>

1488
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:07,694
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1489
01:05:08,153 --> 01:05:09,529
Thanks again, Officer.

1490
01:05:09,863 --> 01:05:12,532
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1491
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:14,242
<i>I was making that much almost every day</i>

1492
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:16,578
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

1493
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:19,414
<i>Now a rathole is a friend,
like Brad here,</i>

1494
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,042
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1495
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:24,377
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1496
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:29,257
<i>I 'd drive the price up then he'd sell
and kick most of the profits back</i> to...

1497
01:05:29,341 --> 01:05:31,176
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1498
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:36,473
<i>All cash. None of it's on the books.</i>

1499
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:38,850
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1500
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,854
<i>Enter our new securities
attorney, Manny Riskin.</i>

1501
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:46,608
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1502
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:48,443
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1503
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,736
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

1504
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,823
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1505
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:55,659
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1506
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,119
Hey! Hey!

1507
01:05:57,202 --> 01:05:58,495
What are you doing? Hey!

1508
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:00,539
We got the SEC in here.

1509
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:02,707
<i>The Securities and Exchange Commission</i>

1510
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,377
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1511
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,379
<i>So I set them up in our conference room</i>

1512
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:08,547
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1513
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,841
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1514
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:12,467
<i>that it felt like Antarctica in there.</i>

1515
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,511
Is it always this cold in here?

1516
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:15,637
I don't know.

1517
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,888
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1518
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:18,390
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1519
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:20,267
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1520
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,603
<i>| was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,</i>

1521
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,939
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1522
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:28,525
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1523
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:32,362
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1524
01:06:32,445 --> 01:06:34,322
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1525
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:36,074
we set the initial sales price

1526
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,910
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1527
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,620
Look.

1528
01:06:40,745 --> 01:06:42,581
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1529
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:44,624
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1530
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,543
The real question is this.

1531
01:06:46,626 --> 01:06:48,503
"Was all this legal?"

1532
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,463
Absolutely fucking not.

1533
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,258
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1534
01:06:57,637 --> 01:06:58,763
<i>And what do you do when you're making</i>

1535
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,307
<i>more money than you know
what to do with?</i>

1536
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,731
Oh, my God!

1537
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:09,774
Will you marry me?

1538
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,651
Oh, my God.

1539
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:13,737
Is that a yes?

1540
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:15,488
Are you sure?

1541
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:17,449
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1542
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:19,492
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1543
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,381
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1544
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,842
<i>The flight there alone was a bacchanal.</i>

1545
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:40,055
<i>One last blowout for the gods
before I settled down for good.</i>

1546
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:41,890
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1547
01:07:41,973 --> 01:07:44,768
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more waiting
once we landed.</i>

1548
01:07:45,477 --> 01:07:46,478
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1549
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:50,398
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1550
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:23,181
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me two million bucks,</i>

1551
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:28,270
<i>including the cost
of refurbishing the entire 28th floor.</i>

1552
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,189
Kiss the bride.

1553
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:36,236
<i>But the wedding
was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1554
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:39,406
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1555
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:40,991
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1556
01:08:41,074 --> 01:08:44,119
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club, our castle.</i>

1557
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,841
<i>Of course, after the bachelor party,
me, the Duke,</i>

1558
01:08:57,924 --> 01:09:00,677
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1559
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,887
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1560
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:10,061
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1561
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,563
A few words for your son?

1562
01:09:11,688 --> 01:09:14,316
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1563
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,527
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1564
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,572
And you know, you know
what you can do, Jordy.

1565
01:09:38,089 --> 01:09:39,382
Oh, my God!

1566
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,842
Aunt Emma?

1567
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:46,931
I can't believe you came!

1568
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:50,602
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1569
01:09:51,394 --> 01:09:52,437
It's Aunt Emma.

1570
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,606
Aunt Emma.

1571
01:09:54,731 --> 01:09:57,067
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1572
01:09:57,942 --> 01:10:00,612
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

1573
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,614
Into the donuts, I see.

1574
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:05,033
Oh, I... I...

1575
01:10:05,116 --> 01:10:06,326
Well...

1576
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:09,454
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1577
01:10:09,537 --> 01:10:10,997
Enjoy the day.

1578
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,500
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1579
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,349
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1580
01:10:29,432 --> 01:10:31,017
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1581
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,477
One, two, three!

1582
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:36,022
What is this?

1583
01:10:36,314 --> 01:10:38,149
- It's your wedding present.
- What?

1584
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,567
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1585
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:42,404
What?

1586
01:10:42,862 --> 01:10:44,989
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1587
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:46,199
A fucking yacht?

1588
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,202
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1589
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:52,080
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1590
01:10:52,163 --> 01:10:55,250
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1591
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,502
<i>is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!</i>

1592
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:59,838
Oh, my God! Baby!

1593
01:11:02,173 --> 01:11:03,800
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1594
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:05,301
- You like it?
- Yes!

1595
01:11:10,974 --> 01:11:13,768
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the</i> Naomi <i>through the Caribbean,</i>

1596
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,854
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1597
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,021
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1598
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:19,691
<i>Seven acres on
the Gold Coast of Long Island.</i>

1599
01:11:19,816 --> 01:11:22,277
<i>The most expensive
real estate in the world.</i>

1600
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,029
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1601
01:11:25,113 --> 01:11:27,574
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1602
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:28,741
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1603
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,956
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1604
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,294
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1605
01:11:40,044 --> 01:11:41,087
Who's Venice?

1606
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,505
- Huh?
'Who?

1607
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:43,590
Who? Who?

1608
01:11:43,673 --> 01:11:45,341
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1609
01:11:45,425 --> 01:11:46,593
Who is she?

1610
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:48,136
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1611
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:50,138
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1612
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:51,806
No way, baby, no!

1613
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,225
You were calling
her name in your sleep!

1614
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:56,936
Are you out of your
fucking mind? I don't...

1615
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,147
I don't even know who Venice is.

1616
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,441
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1617
01:12:01,524 --> 01:12:04,277
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1618
01:12:08,072 --> 01:12:10,241
Venice...

1619
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:12,827
Venice, baby, where are you?

1620
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:14,829
Venice!

1621
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:17,040
Venice!

1622
01:12:17,415 --> 01:12:18,833
Where'd you go?

1623
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,673
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1624
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:27,926
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1625
01:12:30,261 --> 01:12:32,388
I like it. I like it.

1626
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,265
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1627
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:35,475
Wolfie?

1628
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:36,851
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1629
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,353
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1630
01:12:38,436 --> 01:12:40,522
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1631
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:42,982
Shut up, you little bitch!

1632
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:45,568
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1633
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:48,655
That's right.

1634
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,031
That's right! I forgot.

1635
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:51,616
I forgot, baby.

1636
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:56,037
Donnie and I were investing
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1637
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,247
That's why all this confusion.

1638
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,873
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1639
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,667
Not Italy. California.

1640
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,252
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1641
01:13:02,335 --> 01:13:03,461
You're a lying piece of shit!

1642
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,712
Duchess, baby, come on.

1643
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:06,339
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1644
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:07,882
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1645
01:13:08,132 --> 01:13:11,094
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1646
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,096
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1647
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:14,597
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1648
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:16,391
And you're still acting like an infant!

1649
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:19,352
God damn it!

1650
01:13:19,435 --> 01:13:22,105
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1651
01:13:22,605 --> 01:13:24,524
Who is the one who flew in here

1652
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:27,485
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1653
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,612
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1654
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,323
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1655
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,130
Does it even matter to you
that I just had that driving range

1656
01:13:47,338 --> 01:13:50,425
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1657
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:52,552
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1658
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,387
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1659
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,556
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1660
01:13:56,639 --> 01:13:57,807
Oh, my God,

1661
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:00,435
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1662
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:03,187
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1663
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:06,190
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1664
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:07,483
What a fucking burden.

1665
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:09,527
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1666
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,738
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1667
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:14,532
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1668
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,492
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1669
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:18,620
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1670
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:20,371
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1671
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,457
Don't fucking dare throw that

1672
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,001
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1673
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:27,378
All right, honey?

1674
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:28,963
Now will you just...

1675
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,923
We could talk this out, all right?

1676
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,384
We just use our words. You know?

1677
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:34,552
Communicate.

1678
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,845
Okay?

1679
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:37,680
Come on, sweetheart.

1680
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:39,724
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1681
01:14:39,849 --> 01:14:41,893
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1682
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,686
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1683
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,063
Babe, come on.

1684
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:48,316
You should feel happy you got a husband

1685
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:50,652
who's in such great shape
like this, huh?

1686
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:52,695
Come here.

1687
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,322
Come on, give me a kiss.

1688
01:14:54,405 --> 01:14:55,448
You look so beautiful right now.

1689
01:14:55,573 --> 01:14:56,658
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1690
01:14:56,741 --> 01:14:57,909
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1691
01:14:57,992 --> 01:14:59,619
Yeah, give me one...

1692
01:15:00,578 --> 01:15:01,913
Fuck you!

1693
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,998
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1694
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:06,459
<i>First I'd get up and fight with Naomi</i>

1695
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:08,753
<i>about whatever it is
I did the night before.</i>

1696
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:11,047
<i>Next was a steam so I could sweat out</i>

1697
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,882
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1698
01:15:12,965 --> 01:15:14,592
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1699
01:15:14,842 --> 01:15:16,594
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1700
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:19,222
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1701
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:21,391
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1702
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:23,434
Good morning, Daddy.

1703
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:25,603
Where's my kiss?

1704
01:15:27,563 --> 01:15:29,065
Hey, sweetheart.

1705
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,820
Does Daddy get a kiss from
both of his little girls, huh?

1706
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:35,279
Oh, no.

1707
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:38,449
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1708
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:40,284
for a very, very,

1709
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:42,120
very long time.

1710
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:45,415
Daddy's really sorry
about what he said in the other room.

1711
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:46,708
He didn't mean any of it.

1712
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:49,085
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1713
01:15:49,627 --> 01:15:51,212
And from now on,

1714
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,799
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1715
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,218
short skirts around the house.

1716
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,306
And you know something else, Daddy?

1717
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:09,397
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

1718
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,151
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1719
01:16:15,528 --> 01:16:16,946
In fact,

1720
01:16:18,948 --> 01:16:21,701
she's decided to throw them

1721
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:24,996
all away.

1722
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:32,670
So take a good look, Daddy.

1723
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:36,132
You're gonna be seeing
an awful lot of this around the house.

1724
01:16:36,215 --> 01:16:37,759
On, baby...

1725
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:39,302
Yeah, Mommy.

1726
01:16:39,802 --> 01:16:41,721
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1727
01:16:42,346 --> 01:16:43,890
Oh, gosh.

1728
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:50,104
What's wrong, Daddy?

1729
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:51,522
Baby.

1730
01:16:53,649 --> 01:16:54,859
God!

1731
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:57,695
Look at this shit.

1732
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,532
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1733
01:17:03,326 --> 01:17:07,872
Mommy, have you ever noticed
anything odd about Mr...

1734
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:09,916
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1735
01:17:12,084 --> 01:17:15,213
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1736
01:17:15,713 --> 01:17:19,175
Yeah, there's something
a little bit different about his eyes.

1737
01:17:19,258 --> 01:17:22,470
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1738
01:17:22,553 --> 01:17:24,388
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1739
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:25,807
<i>Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

1740
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:27,308
See that, huh?

1741
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:29,143
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1742
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,978
<i>she chooses today
to give me blue balls!</i>

1743
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:34,148
<i>I mean, today was
the biggest day in Stratton's history,</i>

1744
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,067
<i>and I needed to be thinking straight.</i>

1745
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:37,568
Hey, Jordan!

1746
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:39,737
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1747
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,949
<i>This was the day that
we launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1748
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:45,159
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1749
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:47,036
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1750
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:48,162
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1751
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:50,414
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1752
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:52,083
What's he doing?

1753
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:54,669
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1754
01:17:54,877 --> 01:17:57,046
What the fuck is he doing?

1755
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:00,049
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1756
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,425
Hi.

1757
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:03,678
How're you doing?

1758
01:18:03,761 --> 01:18:04,762
Good.

1759
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,473
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1760
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,643
I just... I had a minute and...

1761
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,436
You had a minute.

1762
01:18:12,728 --> 01:18:15,064
And today you needed
to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1763
01:18:15,147 --> 01:18:18,818
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1764
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:20,778
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1765
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,035
On new issue day?

1766
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:32,290
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1767
01:18:32,415 --> 01:18:33,583
This is what you do?

1768
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,544
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1769
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:39,797
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1770
01:18:53,477 --> 01:18:55,313
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1771
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,481
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1772
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:59,066
Get the fuck out!

1773
01:19:02,737 --> 01:19:04,238
Everybody on point!

1774
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:07,241
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1775
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,496
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1776
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,207
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.
I caught a genius.

1777
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:16,751
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1778
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:17,960
The great American cobbler.

1779
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:20,421
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.</i>

1780
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:24,091
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1781
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:27,887
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling out
of the primordial ooze.</i>

1782
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,972
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1783
01:19:30,306 --> 01:19:31,599
That's why they gotta see your face.

1784
01:19:31,682 --> 01:19:34,143
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1785
01:19:34,226 --> 01:19:36,812
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1786
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:39,190
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1787
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:41,776
<i>which legally speaking was a big no-no,</i>

1788
01:19:41,859 --> 01:19:45,237
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1789
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:47,823
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1790
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,700
<i>But not too worked up.</i>

1791
01:19:51,118 --> 01:19:52,495
Hello. If...

1792
01:19:53,537 --> 01:19:55,706
For those of you who don't know me...

1793
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:57,041
My name's Steve Madden.

1794
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,668
Yeah, we know who you are.

1795
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,252
Your name is on the box.

1796
01:20:00,461 --> 01:20:02,004
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1797
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:03,673
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1798
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,968
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1799
01:20:07,051 --> 01:20:09,887
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1800
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,555
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1801
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:12,807
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1802
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1803
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:18,270
the Mary Lou is actually the same
as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1804
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1805
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,571
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1806
01:20:27,863 --> 01:20:29,156
All right!

1807
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,493
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1808
01:20:32,576 --> 01:20:34,745
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1809
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:37,289
Give him a round of applause!

1810
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,626
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1811
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:43,587
You having a good afternoon or what?

1812
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,174
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1813
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:49,552
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1814
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:54,348
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1815
01:20:54,932 --> 01:20:58,436
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1816
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:01,856
it goes beyond just
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1817
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:05,693
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1818
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,445
You understand?

1819
01:21:07,653 --> 01:21:09,739
Artists like Steve
come along once every decade.

1820
01:21:09,822 --> 01:21:13,242
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1821
01:21:13,325 --> 01:21:14,952
Yves Saint Laurent.

1822
01:21:15,411 --> 01:21:17,038
Steve, come over here for a second.

1823
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:19,290
I don't think you all realize

1824
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:21,333
that Steve Madden

1825
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:24,962
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1826
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,338
with orders going through the roof

1827
01:21:26,422 --> 01:21:29,759
at every department store
in North America right now.

1828
01:21:30,259 --> 01:21:32,261
We have him here in our office!

1829
01:21:33,304 --> 01:21:36,098
We should thank
our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1830
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,768
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1831
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,936
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1832
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,564
Like this! Okay?

1833
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:45,441
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1834
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:47,902
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1835
01:21:48,527 --> 01:21:49,779
This is our golden ticket

1836
01:21:49,987 --> 01:21:52,281
to the fucking chocolate
factory right here!

1837
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,325
And I wanna meet

1838
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,660
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1839
01:21:57,328 --> 01:22:00,164
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this!

1840
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:06,670
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1841
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:09,548
All right, I want all of you
to focus for a second.

1842
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,093
See those little black boxes?

1843
01:22:12,343 --> 01:22:13,427
They're called telephones.

1844
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:16,263
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1845
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,933
They're not gonna dial
themselves. Okay?

1846
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:22,770
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1847
01:22:23,395 --> 01:22:26,982
Like a loaded M16 without
a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1848
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:30,444
And in the case of the telephone,

1849
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:33,239
it's up to each and every one of you,

1850
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,826
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1851
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,245
My killers!

1852
01:22:39,995 --> 01:22:43,290
My killers, who will not
take no for an answer!

1853
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,751
My fucking warriors,

1854
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,212
who will not hang up the phone

1855
01:22:48,295 --> 01:22:51,298
until their client either buys

1856
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:53,551
or fucking dies!

1857
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,109
Let me tell you something.

1858
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:13,195
There is no nobility in poverty.

1859
01:23:13,654 --> 01:23:16,657
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1860
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,160
And I choose rich every fucking time.

1861
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:23,080
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1862
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:27,001
I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit

1863
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:29,670
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1864
01:23:33,924 --> 01:23:35,009
Duke it out! Hit him!

1865
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:36,510
Get the fuck off me!

1866
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:42,141
And if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial or materialistic,

1867
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:44,518
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1868
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,604
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

1869
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:52,276
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1870
01:23:53,068 --> 01:23:56,155
I want you to take a good look
at the person next to you. Go on.

1871
01:23:57,156 --> 01:23:59,408
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1872
01:23:59,825 --> 01:24:03,287
you're gonna be pulling up to a red light
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1873
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:06,665
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1874
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:08,876
in their brand new Porsche

1875
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,712
with their beautiful wife by their side,

1876
01:24:11,795 --> 01:24:13,797
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1877
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,718
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

1878
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:21,096
Some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor-stubble,

1879
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,514
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1880
01:24:22,598 --> 01:24:24,975
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1881
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:26,810
from the fucking Price Club!

1882
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:29,188
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1883
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:31,523
So you listen to me and you listen well.

1884
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,859
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

1885
01:24:34,276 --> 01:24:36,445
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1886
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:39,406
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1887
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:41,867
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1888
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:45,246
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1889
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:48,374
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1890
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:52,002
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1891
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:57,466
All you have to do today
is pick up that phone

1892
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:01,512
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1893
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:03,764
And I will make you richer

1894
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:06,934
than the most powerful CEO
in the United States of fucking America!

1895
01:25:07,017 --> 01:25:08,185
Yeah!

1896
01:25:09,353 --> 01:25:10,604
Fuck, yeah!

1897
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,315
I want you to go out there

1898
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:15,859
and I want you to ram

1899
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:19,446
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

1900
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,824
until they fucking choke on it!

1901
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:26,495
Till they choke on it and they buy
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

1902
01:25:26,578 --> 01:25:28,122
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

1903
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:29,832
You be ferocious!

1904
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,875
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

1905
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:35,254
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

1906
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:40,301
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

1907
01:26:10,622 --> 01:26:15,336
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

1908
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:18,547
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

1909
01:26:18,672 --> 01:26:20,966
<i>Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.</i>

1910
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:32,811
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

1911
01:26:32,895 --> 01:26:35,856
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

1912
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:38,108
Now once the price hit the high teens...

1913
01:26:38,275 --> 01:26:40,402
You know what? Who gives a shit?

1914
01:26:40,486 --> 01:26:42,446
As always, the point is this.

1915
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:46,950
$22 million in three fucking hours!

1916
01:26:48,118 --> 01:26:49,953
Can you believe this shit?

1917
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:52,456
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

1918
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:53,957
Jordan!

1919
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,376
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

1920
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:57,086
- from Future Video.
- Who?

1921
01:26:57,169 --> 01:26:58,379
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1922
01:26:58,462 --> 01:26:59,505
He says it's urgent.

1923
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,715
Urgent? Who the fuck
is Barry Kleinman?

1924
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,384
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

1925
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:04,510
You're in love with me?

1926
01:27:04,593 --> 01:27:05,636
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

1927
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:06,762
Hey, Barry, what's up?

1928
01:27:06,845 --> 01:27:08,972
Listen, I got this subpoena.

1929
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,516
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

1930
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:13,227
Yeah, the FBI, they want
a copy of your wedding video.

1931
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:14,478
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

1932
01:27:14,686 --> 01:27:16,522
- You fucking kidding me?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

1933
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:17,898
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

1934
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:19,650
<i>He's an agent with the New York office.</i>

1935
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:20,776
<i>What's his problem?</i>

1936
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:23,487
<i>He's a Boy Scout.
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

1937
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,031
What does he want
with my wedding video?

1938
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:27,741
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

1939
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,159
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

1940
01:27:29,284 --> 01:27:30,577
It's intrusive, you know.

1941
01:27:30,661 --> 01:27:33,330
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1942
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,249
Pictures, names of the people.

1943
01:27:35,332 --> 01:27:36,333
You know what he's trying to do?

1944
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,543
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

1945
01:27:37,668 --> 01:27:38,836
He's trying to rattle you,

1946
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:40,421
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

1947
01:27:40,504 --> 01:27:43,215
so she nags you until
you become a fucking witness.

1948
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:44,758
He wants me to rat on myself?

1949
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:46,635
He wants me to
give information about my...

1950
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,554
Listen. The good fucking news is,

1951
01:27:48,637 --> 01:27:50,431
you know I know everybody downtown,

1952
01:27:50,514 --> 01:27:52,724
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

1953
01:27:52,808 --> 01:27:55,894
nobody even knows you fucking exist,
so calm down!

1954
01:27:56,186 --> 01:27:57,396
They don't know I exist?

1955
01:27:57,688 --> 01:27:59,314
- No.
- That's good.

1956
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:05,362
But you...

1957
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,905
You know who he is, right?

1958
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:09,616
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

1959
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,660
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

1960
01:28:11,743 --> 01:28:14,955
you could go to his house, right?

1961
01:28:15,038 --> 01:28:16,915
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

1962
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:18,125
You could get some information...

1963
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:21,003
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

1964
01:28:21,086 --> 01:28:22,171
You don't fuck with them like that.

1965
01:28:22,254 --> 01:28:23,422
What are you, nuts or something?

1966
01:28:23,505 --> 01:28:25,132
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1967
01:28:25,215 --> 01:28:28,302
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

1968
01:28:28,385 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm not a cop anymore.

1969
01:28:29,553 --> 01:28:31,555
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

1970
01:28:31,638 --> 01:28:32,723
Okay.

1971
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:35,684
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

1972
01:28:35,976 --> 01:28:37,227
Can I give the guy a call?

1973
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:40,439
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

1974
01:28:40,522 --> 01:28:41,523
Do me a favor?

1975
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,526
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

1976
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:45,611
I can't call him, right?

1977
01:28:45,694 --> 01:28:47,446
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

1978
01:28:47,529 --> 01:28:49,198
whatever the fuck you say to him,

1979
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:51,909
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

1980
01:28:51,992 --> 01:28:53,744
He's smart, you're dumb.

1981
01:28:53,827 --> 01:28:55,078
Fucking bullshit.

1982
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:58,165
Are we fucking talking tonight,
or are you gonna get schwacked?

1983
01:28:58,248 --> 01:28:59,791
The last time you
took these fucking pills,

1984
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,877
you put your head in the
fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.

1985
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:04,421
All right.

1986
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,048
Okay, I won't call him.

1987
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:12,888
Hey, fellas! Come on board.
The plank's right around there.

1988
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:15,140
Welcome!

1989
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:17,935
What a nice day.

1990
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:20,270
Hey.

1991
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:22,272
Welcome aboard.

1992
01:29:22,773 --> 01:29:25,400
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>
Pleasure to meet you.

1993
01:29:25,484 --> 01:29:27,069
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1994
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:28,195
Hi, how are you?

1995
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:31,532
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

1996
01:29:31,615 --> 01:29:34,117
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1997
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,369
These are friends of Stratton.

1998
01:29:35,452 --> 01:29:36,954
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1999
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:43,085
Your message said that
you wanted to speak privately.

2000
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:44,962
Right. I do want to speak privately.

2001
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:46,380
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2002
01:29:46,463 --> 01:29:48,048
Let me know if I can get you anything.

2003
01:29:48,131 --> 01:29:49,967
We'd be happy to help.

2004
01:29:50,175 --> 01:29:51,218
You guys hungry?

2005
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:54,096
Want something to eat?
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2006
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:56,557
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2007
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,100
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2008
01:29:58,183 --> 01:29:59,601
to drink while we're at sea.

2009
01:29:59,768 --> 01:30:02,229
Duh! Of course.

2010
01:30:02,312 --> 01:30:04,147
Ever been on one of these before?

2011
01:30:04,314 --> 01:30:05,566
A boat?

2012
01:30:06,316 --> 01:30:07,609
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2013
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:09,778
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2014
01:30:09,861 --> 01:30:11,572
On one like this, though?

2015
01:30:11,655 --> 01:30:14,449
I had the whole front extended in order
to fit the chopper up there.

2016
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:15,867
See that?

2017
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,620
Anyway, this is for you.

2018
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:21,540
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

2019
01:30:21,623 --> 01:30:24,376
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2020
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:27,212
Figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

2021
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:29,047
- There you go.
- Look,

2022
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:32,050
my point is that
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2023
01:30:32,134 --> 01:30:35,637
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2024
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:37,389
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2025
01:30:37,472 --> 01:30:39,182
we're a little loud in
the way we do things.

2026
01:30:39,266 --> 01:30:40,392
But you gotta understand,

2027
01:30:40,475 --> 01:30:41,935
we're the new guys
on the block, you know,

2028
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,146
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2029
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:48,859
But I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

2030
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:50,736
Whatsoever.

2031
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:52,362
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2032
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:55,490
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2033
01:30:55,574 --> 01:30:58,201
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2034
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:01,038
Well, you know the SEC
is a civil regulatory agency.

2035
01:31:01,121 --> 01:31:02,664
We pursue criminal activities.

2036
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,584
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2037
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:09,212
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

2038
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:10,672
I mean, honestly...

2039
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:14,593
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2040
01:31:14,718 --> 01:31:15,969
Well, I...

2041
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:18,472
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2042
01:31:18,555 --> 01:31:20,223
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2043
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:21,725
With that said...

2044
01:31:22,601 --> 01:31:24,436
This case got dumped on my desk...

2045
01:31:24,519 --> 01:31:26,355
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2046
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:29,650
who needs to make a show of looking
into the new company on the block,

2047
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:31,193
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2048
01:31:31,318 --> 01:31:34,863
And then I end up being the schmuck
who does the looking. Exactly.

2049
01:31:34,946 --> 01:31:36,865
It's just, you know... It bothers me.

2050
01:31:36,948 --> 01:31:39,493
We're the new guy. We're the one
that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2051
01:31:39,576 --> 01:31:40,661
I mean, you should...

2052
01:31:40,744 --> 01:31:42,663
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firms.

2053
01:31:42,746 --> 01:31:44,206
I mean, I know all the information.

2054
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:47,167
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2055
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,252
Collateralized debt obligations?

2056
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:50,629
This Internet stock bullshit?

2057
01:31:50,712 --> 01:31:52,506
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2058
01:31:52,589 --> 01:31:57,594
I could take you step-by-step
through what exactly is occurring.

2059
01:31:57,844 --> 01:31:59,429
All you have to do is ask.

2060
01:31:59,596 --> 01:32:00,889
I'm available.

2061
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:02,432
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2062
01:32:02,516 --> 01:32:05,394
I don't see why a little
sit-down like this

2063
01:32:06,269 --> 01:32:07,813
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2064
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:10,190
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2065
01:32:10,273 --> 01:32:11,775
- It should.
- Look.

2066
01:32:12,317 --> 01:32:14,528
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2067
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:17,531
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2068
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:19,449
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2069
01:32:22,035 --> 01:32:23,704
Are you sure you guys
don't want something to drink?

2070
01:32:23,787 --> 01:32:25,455
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2071
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:27,165
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2072
01:32:30,293 --> 01:32:32,879
Let me ask you,
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2073
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:35,257
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2074
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,760
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2075
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:41,680
Did I hear that right? Were you trying
to take a stab at Wall Street?

2076
01:32:42,597 --> 01:32:44,516
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2077
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:45,600
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2078
01:32:45,684 --> 01:32:48,437
Well, you're investigating me.
I hear things.

2079
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,605
You know what I mean?

2080
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:52,274
You ever think about
what would've happened

2081
01:32:52,357 --> 01:32:54,818
if you would have stayed the course?

2082
01:32:56,236 --> 01:32:58,071
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2083
01:32:58,155 --> 01:32:59,406
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2084
01:32:59,489 --> 01:33:01,283
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2085
01:33:01,366 --> 01:33:02,868
Yeah, you bet I do.

2086
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:04,619
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2087
01:33:04,703 --> 01:33:05,746
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2088
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:06,997
What do you get...

2089
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,331
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2090
01:33:08,415 --> 01:33:09,791
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2091
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,919
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2092
01:33:13,044 --> 01:33:15,046
A year? In the ballpark?

2093
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,590
Well, I...

2094
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:18,467
Let's put it this way.

2095
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,344
You get a free handgun
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2096
01:33:22,095 --> 01:33:24,222
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2097
01:33:24,306 --> 01:33:26,475
You think about the people
that built this country,

2098
01:33:26,558 --> 01:33:27,976
hardworking people like you.

2099
01:33:28,059 --> 01:33:30,604
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2100
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:34,399
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2101
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,359
It fucking makes me angry.

2102
01:33:36,443 --> 01:33:39,529
Now the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is,

2103
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:41,281
for me, I feel

2104
01:33:42,365 --> 01:33:44,701
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2105
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,953
There are situations where I can

2106
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:50,582
make those situations better for people.
You know?

2107
01:33:50,665 --> 01:33:51,958
You know what I mean.

2108
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:53,460
Opportunity...

2109
01:33:53,752 --> 01:33:55,003
is everything.

2110
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,332
Exactly.

2111
01:33:56,457 --> 01:33:58,918
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2112
01:33:59,001 --> 01:34:02,797
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2113
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,673
He was bogged down by student loans.

2114
01:34:04,757 --> 01:34:07,468
Turns out, his mother
needed triple bypass surgery.

2115
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:08,969
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2116
01:34:09,053 --> 01:34:10,012
Sure.

2117
01:34:10,095 --> 01:34:11,180
But we got him into the market

2118
01:34:11,263 --> 01:34:12,973
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2119
01:34:13,057 --> 01:34:14,809
We gave him the right guidance.

2120
01:34:14,892 --> 01:34:18,062
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2121
01:34:18,187 --> 01:34:21,524
Got to put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

2122
01:34:21,607 --> 01:34:24,485
It didn't work out for her, granted,
she passed away, unfortunately.

2123
01:34:24,568 --> 01:34:26,487
But we gave him that opportunity.

2124
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,738
You know what I'm saying?

2125
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:32,952
It's just about setting up the right team,
and then overnight your life can change.

2126
01:34:38,332 --> 01:34:40,751
What does... What does an intern...

2127
01:34:42,294 --> 01:34:44,171
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2128
01:34:44,255 --> 01:34:46,298
Well, in that situation,

2129
01:34:47,216 --> 01:34:50,261
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2130
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:53,097
north of half a million dollars.

2131
01:34:56,725 --> 01:34:58,978
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2132
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:01,730
anybody that needs the proper guidance.

2133
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:25,629
Can you say that again,
just the way you said it?

2134
01:35:26,046 --> 01:35:27,756
Just the same way.

2135
01:35:31,969 --> 01:35:33,053
I don't know what you're talking about.

2136
01:35:33,137 --> 01:35:35,389
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2137
01:35:35,472 --> 01:35:37,474
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2138
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:38,684
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2139
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:40,895
You just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2140
01:35:40,978 --> 01:35:43,063
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2141
01:35:43,147 --> 01:35:45,566
No, no, that's not
the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2142
01:35:45,649 --> 01:35:47,151
No, no, according
to the U.S. criminal code,

2143
01:35:47,234 --> 01:35:50,654
there needs to be an exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

2144
01:35:50,738 --> 01:35:52,364
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2145
01:35:52,448 --> 01:35:54,116
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2146
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:56,911
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2147
01:35:56,994 --> 01:35:57,995
Yeah.

2148
01:35:58,078 --> 01:35:59,580
The same gentleman that told me

2149
01:35:59,663 --> 01:36:01,415
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2150
01:36:01,498 --> 01:36:03,626
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2151
01:36:03,751 --> 01:36:05,210
He ran a security check on me.

2152
01:36:05,294 --> 01:36:06,503
Well...

2153
01:36:06,629 --> 01:36:09,590
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2154
01:36:09,673 --> 01:36:12,343
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2155
01:36:13,135 --> 01:36:15,054
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2156
01:36:15,179 --> 01:36:16,430
What do you say?

2157
01:36:17,514 --> 01:36:18,766
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2158
01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:21,852
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses that I bust,

2159
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:24,605
they're to the manor born.

2160
01:36:24,688 --> 01:36:25,773
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2161
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,485
Their fathers are douchebags,
just like their fathers before them.

2162
01:36:30,611 --> 01:36:32,029
But you...

2163
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:36,033
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2164
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,368
Did I?

2165
01:36:37,451 --> 01:36:39,536
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2166
01:36:39,662 --> 01:36:40,913
Good for you.

2167
01:36:41,038 --> 01:36:42,164
Me, the little man?

2168
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:43,290
And let me tell you something.

2169
01:36:43,374 --> 01:36:45,209
Let me tell you something else.

2170
01:36:45,334 --> 01:36:47,503
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2171
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:48,796
this is one of the nicest boats

2172
01:36:48,879 --> 01:36:50,881
that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2173
01:36:50,965 --> 01:36:52,383
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2174
01:36:52,508 --> 01:36:55,761
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be
back at the office

2175
01:36:55,886 --> 01:36:58,055
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2176
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,349
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2177
01:37:00,432 --> 01:37:01,725
look at this thing!

2178
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:03,143
It's beautiful!

2179
01:37:03,227 --> 01:37:06,188
And you got the beautiful girls there.
It's wonderful.

2180
01:37:06,271 --> 01:37:08,732
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2181
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:10,442
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other...

2182
01:37:10,526 --> 01:37:11,568
real soon.
- I'm sure.

2183
01:37:11,652 --> 01:37:15,114
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2184
01:37:15,197 --> 01:37:18,283
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls in the meantime.

2185
01:37:18,409 --> 01:37:21,036
Hey, you guys want to take
some lobsters for your ride home?

2186
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,747
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2187
01:37:23,831 --> 01:37:25,916
Fucking cheap fucks.

2188
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:28,043
Fucking miserable pricks.

2189
01:37:28,127 --> 01:37:31,338
Hey, fellas! Look what
I found in my pocket! Look!

2190
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,382
A year's salary right here.

2191
01:37:33,465 --> 01:37:36,135
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2192
01:37:36,218 --> 01:37:37,469
See that!

2193
01:37:38,012 --> 01:37:40,014
They're fun coupons!

2194
01:37:47,813 --> 01:37:50,566
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2195
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:52,693
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

2196
01:37:52,776 --> 01:37:55,446
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2197
01:37:56,739 --> 01:37:58,282
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2198
01:37:58,407 --> 01:38:00,034
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2199
01:38:00,117 --> 01:38:01,160
That's for European pussy!

2200
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:02,494
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2201
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:04,955
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2202
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,417
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

2203
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,544
<i>I could sleep through the entire flight.</i>

2204
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:13,297
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2205
01:38:13,922 --> 01:38:15,966
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,</i>

2206
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,509
<i>which started kicking in by the time</i>

2207
01:38:17,593 --> 01:38:19,344
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2208
01:38:19,595 --> 01:38:20,804
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2209
01:38:21,138 --> 01:38:22,806
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2210
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,809
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2211
01:38:25,976 --> 01:38:27,478
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2212
01:38:29,646 --> 01:38:31,982
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2213
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:34,777
<i>and pretty much lost all my motor skills.</i>

2214
01:38:35,027 --> 01:38:36,528
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2215
01:38:39,573 --> 01:38:42,951
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2216
01:38:43,035 --> 01:38:44,620
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2217
01:38:45,537 --> 01:38:47,498
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2218
01:38:47,581 --> 01:38:49,291
Wow! Look at you!

2219
01:38:49,374 --> 01:38:51,335
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2220
01:38:51,543 --> 01:38:53,712
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2221
01:38:53,796 --> 01:38:55,339
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2222
01:38:55,422 --> 01:38:57,174
We have the boarding passes.

2223
01:38:57,299 --> 01:38:59,301
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2224
01:38:59,927 --> 01:39:01,637
Hey! Fucking relax.

2225
01:39:01,845 --> 01:39:03,889
Oh, my God!
You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2226
01:39:03,972 --> 01:39:05,349
I don't. Cut it out.

2227
01:39:05,432 --> 01:39:06,433
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2228
01:39:06,517 --> 01:39:07,518
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2229
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:08,811
You got your hand on his dick?

2230
01:39:08,894 --> 01:39:10,854
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2231
01:39:10,938 --> 01:39:12,898
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2232
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,191
Take it off!

2233
01:39:14,274 --> 01:39:16,985
I heard there's
a treasure map under here.

2234
01:39:17,111 --> 01:39:19,655
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2235
01:39:19,738 --> 01:39:21,240
Please sit down.

2236
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:22,783
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2237
01:39:22,866 --> 01:39:25,160
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2238
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:27,121
I will have to call the captain.

2239
01:39:27,204 --> 01:39:29,706
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2240
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,458
Please sit down!

2241
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:33,127
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2242
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,837
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2243
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,130
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2244
01:39:36,213 --> 01:39:37,756
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2245
01:39:38,382 --> 01:39:39,925
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2246
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:41,051
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2247
01:39:41,135 --> 01:39:42,261
Sit down. Fasten it.

2248
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:43,846
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2249
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:44,930
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2250
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:46,181
You gotta speak English.

2251
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:48,225
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2252
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:49,810
I Will help him With his seat belt.

2253
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:53,021
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2254
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,232
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2255
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,236
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2256
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:15,794
Jesus Christ!

2257
01:40:15,878 --> 01:40:17,254
Fuck!

2258
01:40:18,922 --> 01:40:20,299
Donnie...

2259
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:23,510
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2260
01:40:24,136 --> 01:40:25,846
I can't untie you.

2261
01:40:25,929 --> 01:40:28,765
The captain tied you up.
He almost fucking tasered you.

2262
01:40:29,725 --> 01:40:30,767
Why?

2263
01:40:31,101 --> 01:40:32,144
Why?

2264
01:40:33,854 --> 01:40:35,105
He's got a fear of flying.

2265
01:40:39,484 --> 01:40:41,028
He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry,

2266
01:40:41,111 --> 01:40:42,905
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2267
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:45,949
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2268
01:40:46,116 --> 01:40:48,285
You were screaming at people.

2269
01:40:48,368 --> 01:40:49,745
Oh, fuck off.

2270
01:40:49,828 --> 01:40:51,955
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2271
01:40:52,039 --> 01:40:53,081
Oh, Jesus.

2272
01:40:53,165 --> 01:40:55,250
You called the captain the N-word.

2273
01:40:55,334 --> 01:40:56,835
I called the captain the N-word?

2274
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,171
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2275
01:40:59,296 --> 01:41:01,632
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2276
01:41:02,466 --> 01:41:05,302
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2277
01:41:06,595 --> 01:41:07,888
Where are the ludes?

2278
01:41:07,971 --> 01:41:09,014
Where are the ludes?

2279
01:41:10,057 --> 01:41:11,558
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2280
01:41:11,642 --> 01:41:13,227
- I got it.
- Okay.

2281
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,895
Thank God.

2282
01:41:15,354 --> 01:41:17,814
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2283
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,941
This is bad.

2284
01:41:19,024 --> 01:41:21,360
Fucking things are against
my chest. I can't breathe.

2285
01:41:21,485 --> 01:41:23,237
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2286
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,030
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2287
01:41:25,614 --> 01:41:26,698
Okay.

2288
01:41:28,325 --> 01:41:29,576
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

2289
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,786
Rub it harder, buddy.

2290
01:41:30,911 --> 01:41:32,496
You're all right.

2291
01:41:32,871 --> 01:41:35,165
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2292
01:41:41,004 --> 01:41:43,882
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2293
01:41:46,009 --> 01:41:47,177
Really?

2294
01:41:51,223 --> 01:41:52,349
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2295
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:53,934
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2296
01:41:54,017 --> 01:41:56,311
Okay? Let's make Geneva
an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2297
01:41:56,395 --> 01:41:57,813
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2298
01:41:57,896 --> 01:41:59,439
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2299
01:41:59,523 --> 01:42:01,108
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2300
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:02,359
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2301
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,737
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2302
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:07,656
Jordan Belfort!

2303
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:08,991
At last.

2304
01:42:09,074 --> 01:42:11,660
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

2305
01:42:11,743 --> 01:42:13,620
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2306
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,248
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2307
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,041
It's a joke.

2308
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:20,419
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2309
01:42:20,794 --> 01:42:22,379
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2310
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:24,172
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2311
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,092
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2312
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,888
Wait. Yes. <i>Excusez-moi,</i> Jordan.

2313
01:42:32,472 --> 01:42:35,517
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2314
01:42:35,642 --> 01:42:36,643
Blah, blah, blah.

2315
01:42:36,727 --> 01:42:38,353
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2316
01:42:38,437 --> 01:42:40,063
Before business can be discussed.

2317
01:42:41,606 --> 01:42:42,733
Yeah.

2318
01:42:45,527 --> 01:42:46,570
Of course.

2319
01:42:47,237 --> 01:42:50,032
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2320
01:42:50,574 --> 01:42:53,452
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2321
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:55,704
to cooperate with an FBI

2322
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:59,166
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2323
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:00,959
<i>Ça depend.</i>

2324
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:02,711
<i>Ça depend?</i>

2325
01:43:02,794 --> 01:43:03,795
<i>Oui.</i>

2326
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,549
<i>Ça depend</i> on what, exactly?

2327
01:43:08,342 --> 01:43:10,594
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2328
01:43:10,677 --> 01:43:12,262
in the coming months.

2329
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:14,931
Shall I check if tanks
are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2330
01:43:15,015 --> 01:43:17,100
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2331
01:43:17,184 --> 01:43:20,020
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2332
01:43:20,228 --> 01:43:22,439
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2333
01:43:22,522 --> 01:43:24,274
- Champagne. <i>Champagne.</i>
- Yeah.

2334
01:43:24,358 --> 01:43:26,735
Yeah, yeah.
French fries, <i>pommes frites.</i>

2335
01:43:27,486 --> 01:43:30,030
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2336
01:43:31,448 --> 01:43:36,495
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2337
01:43:39,122 --> 01:43:42,793
<i>I understand perfectly,
you American shit.</i>

2338
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:47,339
The only way the Banque Réal de Genève

2339
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:49,508
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2340
01:43:49,633 --> 01:43:53,762
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2341
01:43:53,887 --> 01:43:58,433
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2342
01:43:59,643 --> 01:44:01,269
From a financial standpoint,

2343
01:44:01,353 --> 01:44:04,439
you are now in heaven.

2344
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,483
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2345
01:44:07,234 --> 01:44:11,780
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2346
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,865
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2347
01:44:14,741 --> 01:44:16,993
We would wipe our ass with it.

2348
01:44:17,661 --> 01:44:20,247
Unless, of course,
it was an investigation

2349
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,165
into stock fraud,

2350
01:44:22,249 --> 01:44:24,418
which is a crime here in Switzerland,
if I'm correct.

2351
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:28,505
Then there would have to be
<i>coopération</i> on your part,

2352
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,590
...if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2353
01:44:30,757 --> 01:44:33,176
Yes, we would.

2354
01:44:33,343 --> 01:44:35,887
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2355
01:44:37,097 --> 01:44:40,142
If it were another name,

2356
01:44:41,351 --> 01:44:42,978
a friend's, <i>camarade...</i>

2357
01:44:43,061 --> 01:44:44,146
Cousin?

2358
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,610
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2359
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:55,449
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard or</i>

2360
01:44:55,574 --> 01:44:58,034
<i>did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2361
01:44:58,118 --> 01:44:59,870
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

2362
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,165
<i>He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.</i>

2363
01:45:03,373 --> 01:45:05,041
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i>

2364
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:07,335
<i>into Switzerland with all that money.</i>

2365
01:45:07,419 --> 01:45:11,256
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

2366
01:45:18,555 --> 01:45:19,973
Jordan.

2367
01:45:20,056 --> 01:45:22,934
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2368
01:45:23,018 --> 01:45:24,436
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2369
01:45:24,519 --> 01:45:26,062
Oh, no, not at all.

2370
01:45:28,607 --> 01:45:30,233
Jordan, come in.

2371
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,903
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma
didn't need too much convincing.</i>

2372
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,072
<i>Turned out the British
weren't too different from the Swiss.</i>

2373
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,742
<i>Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2374
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:41,119
<i>How do you say "rathole" in British?</i>

2375
01:45:41,536 --> 01:45:43,997
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2376
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,833
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2377
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:48,210
That I promise.

2378
01:45:48,919 --> 01:45:51,588
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2379
01:45:55,926 --> 01:45:57,719
Sometimes I wonder

2380
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:01,014
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2381
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:04,267
Among other substances.

2382
01:46:08,688 --> 01:46:10,065
It's that obvious, huh?

2383
01:46:10,148 --> 01:46:13,401
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2384
01:46:16,112 --> 01:46:17,948
What can I say? I'm...

2385
01:46:18,823 --> 01:46:20,492
I'm a drug addict.

2386
01:46:20,617 --> 01:46:21,952
I really am.

2387
01:46:22,994 --> 01:46:24,746
Cocaine, pills,

2388
01:46:25,247 --> 01:46:27,666
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2389
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:29,918
Now that's the truth.

2390
01:46:30,001 --> 01:46:31,253
I mean...

2391
01:46:31,336 --> 01:46:32,712
I'm a sex addict, too.

2392
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:36,049
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2393
01:46:37,342 --> 01:46:39,719
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I...

2394
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:41,429
I'm sorry.

2395
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,391
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2396
01:46:44,766 --> 01:46:47,477
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2397
01:46:48,645 --> 01:46:50,063
I suppose it's...

2398
01:46:50,146 --> 01:46:51,565
Just my job, you know.

2399
01:46:52,816 --> 01:46:54,776
All these people dependent on me.

2400
01:46:54,859 --> 01:46:57,571
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2401
01:46:57,654 --> 01:46:59,364
Sometimes I feel like I...

2402
01:46:59,447 --> 01:47:02,617
I've bitten off more than
I can chew, you know.

2403
01:47:02,826 --> 01:47:05,120
You're a man with large appetites.

2404
01:47:05,287 --> 01:47:06,371
Yeah.

2405
01:47:08,081 --> 01:47:10,000
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2406
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:11,376
Yeah.

2407
01:47:11,501 --> 01:47:12,794
Yeah, I am.

2408
01:47:15,171 --> 01:47:18,508
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2409
01:47:18,842 --> 01:47:20,385
My decision.

2410
01:47:20,885 --> 01:47:22,345
It's just hard to...

2411
01:47:22,429 --> 01:47:26,349
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2412
01:47:26,933 --> 01:47:28,476
You know, to...

2413
01:47:28,685 --> 01:47:31,354
Learn to relax and let go and...

2414
01:47:32,355 --> 01:47:34,357
To release the tension.

2415
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,860
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2416
01:47:37,819 --> 01:47:39,237
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2417
01:47:39,529 --> 01:47:41,781
Yeah, to release the tension.

2418
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:47,370
I suppose we...

2419
01:47:47,912 --> 01:47:50,248
We all just need to learn...

2420
01:47:50,874 --> 01:47:54,169
Learn to do what
comes naturally in life, you know?

2421
01:47:56,087 --> 01:47:58,548
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2422
01:48:04,763 --> 01:48:06,431
Stability, dear.

2423
01:48:06,514 --> 01:48:07,932
Family.

2424
01:48:14,564 --> 01:48:16,733
You take care of my niece, my love.

2425
01:48:16,816 --> 01:48:19,361
I'll take care of everything over here.

2426
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,404
Deal.

2427
01:48:23,948 --> 01:48:26,117
Come on! There you go.

2428
01:48:28,161 --> 01:48:31,414
<i>We had, literally, a fuckload of money.</i>

2429
01:48:31,915 --> 01:48:33,917
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

2430
01:48:34,751 --> 01:48:38,421
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2431
01:48:38,588 --> 01:48:40,507
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2432
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,385
<i>Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,</i>

2433
01:48:43,468 --> 01:48:45,679
<i>spent his winters in the south of France,</i>

2434
01:48:45,762 --> 01:48:47,806
<i>which is where
he met his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2435
01:48:47,889 --> 01:48:50,767
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2436
01:48:50,934 --> 01:48:52,352
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2437
01:48:52,936 --> 01:48:54,437
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2438
01:48:58,608 --> 01:49:00,276
Well, this is fucked.

2439
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:02,779
No shit.

2440
01:49:06,282 --> 01:49:08,743
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2441
01:49:08,827 --> 01:49:10,036
I know.

2442
01:49:13,748 --> 01:49:14,958
Let me ask you something?

2443
01:49:15,083 --> 01:49:17,669
What about her family? Right?

2444
01:49:17,752 --> 01:49:20,422
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, right.

2445
01:49:20,505 --> 01:49:22,382
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2446
01:49:22,465 --> 01:49:24,384
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2447
01:49:24,467 --> 01:49:26,386
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2448
01:49:26,469 --> 01:49:28,054
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2449
01:49:28,138 --> 01:49:29,389
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2450
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:31,933
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2451
01:49:32,016 --> 01:49:34,853
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2452
01:49:36,646 --> 01:49:37,731
I'm sorry, what's that?

2453
01:49:37,814 --> 01:49:39,274
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2454
01:49:39,357 --> 01:49:41,401
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2455
01:49:41,776 --> 01:49:43,987
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2456
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:46,656
When it gets in, I'll give you a call,
you come pick it up.

2457
01:49:49,284 --> 01:49:50,702
You give me a call?

2458
01:49:52,328 --> 01:49:55,582
When it gets here, I'll give you a call
and you'll come pick it up.

2459
01:49:55,665 --> 01:49:57,459
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2460
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:00,962
Sweetheart,
you have my money taped to your tits.

2461
01:50:01,045 --> 01:50:03,047
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2462
01:50:06,092 --> 01:50:07,677
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2463
01:50:07,927 --> 01:50:09,429
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2464
01:50:09,512 --> 01:50:10,472
I ain't going to him, okay.

2465
01:50:10,555 --> 01:50:11,598
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

2466
01:50:11,681 --> 01:50:12,974
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2467
01:50:13,057 --> 01:50:14,100
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2468
01:50:14,184 --> 01:50:15,769
We meet some place that I fucking say.

2469
01:50:15,852 --> 01:50:17,228
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2470
01:50:17,312 --> 01:50:18,480
he comes correct.
- I will.

2471
01:50:18,563 --> 01:50:20,857
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2472
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,776
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

2473
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:24,611
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2474
01:50:24,694 --> 01:50:26,404
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2475
01:50:26,488 --> 01:50:28,782
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2476
01:50:28,865 --> 01:50:30,700
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2477
01:50:30,784 --> 01:50:32,786
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2478
01:50:32,869 --> 01:50:34,245
I put that money in there!

2479
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:35,705
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2480
01:50:35,789 --> 01:50:38,082
I got five more just like you, bro.

2481
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:39,876
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2482
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:41,711
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2483
01:50:41,795 --> 01:50:42,796
So fuck you!

2484
01:50:42,879 --> 01:50:44,631
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2485
01:50:44,714 --> 01:50:46,549
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2486
01:50:46,674 --> 01:50:48,468
You okay? Hey, pal.

2487
01:50:51,179 --> 01:50:53,973
<i>The next day, Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2488
01:50:54,057 --> 01:50:56,392
<i>Two million in cash in her carry-on,</i>

2489
01:50:56,476 --> 01:50:59,437
<i>which in the big picture
was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2490
01:51:00,688 --> 01:51:01,981
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2491
01:51:02,065 --> 01:51:03,942
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

2492
01:51:04,025 --> 01:51:08,071
<i>Chantalle's family and friends
smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

2493
01:51:08,154 --> 01:51:09,906
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2494
01:51:14,911 --> 01:51:16,830
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2495
01:51:16,913 --> 01:51:18,122
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2496
01:51:18,206 --> 01:51:19,332
<i>And here.</i>

2497
01:51:19,415 --> 01:51:21,417
<i>- Welcome.
- Welcome.</i>

2498
01:51:21,501 --> 01:51:23,753
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2499
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,715
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2500
01:51:27,799 --> 01:51:29,342
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2501
01:51:29,425 --> 01:51:30,635
Who cares. You're blonde.

2502
01:51:30,718 --> 01:51:31,719
Oh, stop.

2503
01:51:52,574 --> 01:51:53,700
Shit.

2504
01:51:53,783 --> 01:51:55,034
Just put the fucking car in park,

2505
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:56,911
you dumb fucking idiot!

2506
01:51:58,454 --> 01:52:00,081
I can't close this briefcase.

2507
01:52:00,164 --> 01:52:01,541
One fucking day.

2508
01:52:01,624 --> 01:52:03,585
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2509
01:52:03,668 --> 01:52:05,253
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2510
01:52:05,795 --> 01:52:08,423
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2511
01:52:13,261 --> 01:52:14,762
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2512
01:52:14,846 --> 01:52:16,806
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2513
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:17,891
It's a fucking joke.

2514
01:52:17,974 --> 01:52:19,559
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2515
01:52:19,642 --> 01:52:21,102
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2516
01:52:21,185 --> 01:52:23,021
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2517
01:52:23,104 --> 01:52:25,773
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2518
01:52:25,857 --> 01:52:27,942
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2519
01:52:28,026 --> 01:52:30,403
With smart important people,
unlike you.

2520
01:52:30,486 --> 01:52:34,365
People who don't sucker-punch people
when they're scared. Okay?

2521
01:52:34,449 --> 01:52:35,825
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2522
01:52:35,909 --> 01:52:36,910
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2523
01:52:36,993 --> 01:52:38,036
You want an apology, okay.

2524
01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:39,537
I check my fucking messages every day

2525
01:52:39,621 --> 01:52:40,580
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2526
01:52:40,663 --> 01:52:41,915
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2527
01:52:41,998 --> 01:52:43,041
I got a blinking light,

2528
01:52:43,124 --> 01:52:44,417
because I don't have shit from you.

2529
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,710
You know what, you got
a big fucking mouth, okay?

2530
01:52:45,793 --> 01:52:47,045
I got my wife checking the messages

2531
01:52:47,128 --> 01:52:49,130
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2532
01:52:49,213 --> 01:52:50,423
"Has Brad apologized yet?"

2533
01:52:50,506 --> 01:52:52,508
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2534
01:52:52,592 --> 01:52:54,135
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2535
01:52:54,218 --> 01:52:55,637
That's not how you treat people.

2536
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,763
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2537
01:52:56,846 --> 01:52:58,514
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2538
01:52:58,598 --> 01:53:00,808
You're gonna give me a pass?

2539
01:53:00,892 --> 01:53:02,477
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2540
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,520
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2541
01:53:04,604 --> 01:53:05,897
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2542
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,981
From Fucksville, huh?

2543
01:53:07,065 --> 01:53:08,942
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2544
01:53:09,025 --> 01:53:10,485
when their Emperor's gone?

2545
01:53:10,568 --> 01:53:12,111
Is it mayhem?

2546
01:53:12,195 --> 01:53:13,988
Are people looting and raping?

2547
01:53:14,072 --> 01:53:16,074
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2548
01:53:16,157 --> 01:53:17,575
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2549
01:53:17,659 --> 01:53:18,952
You back the fuck up.

2550
01:53:19,035 --> 01:53:22,497
I'll cause the biggest fucking scene
that I've ever caused in my life

2551
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,332
if you come at me again.

2552
01:53:24,415 --> 01:53:26,000
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2553
01:53:26,084 --> 01:53:27,293
I got...

2554
01:53:27,377 --> 01:53:31,965
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2555
01:53:32,048 --> 01:53:33,508
Like when you come at me...

2556
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:34,676
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2557
01:53:34,759 --> 01:53:36,177
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2558
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,971
You have like a fucking, like...

2559
01:53:38,054 --> 01:53:40,056
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2560
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:41,599
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2561
01:53:41,683 --> 01:53:43,267
Jesus fucking Christ.

2562
01:53:43,351 --> 01:53:45,311
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2563
01:53:45,395 --> 01:53:47,105
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2564
01:53:47,188 --> 01:53:48,898
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2565
01:53:48,982 --> 01:53:50,108
You know what I mean? It's not...

2566
01:53:50,191 --> 01:53:52,110
- It's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2567
01:53:52,193 --> 01:53:54,612
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2568
01:53:54,696 --> 01:53:56,072
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2569
01:53:56,155 --> 01:53:57,532
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2570
01:53:57,615 --> 01:54:00,910
You gotta take this case,
you gotta drive straight home,

2571
01:54:00,994 --> 01:54:04,497
need you to open up the briefcase,
and you take out every single dollar.

2572
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,541
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2573
01:54:06,624 --> 01:54:07,750
And once you have it all

2574
01:54:07,834 --> 01:54:09,627
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2575
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:12,005
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2576
01:54:12,088 --> 01:54:14,173
your wife's Latvian cunt,
you understand?

2577
01:54:14,257 --> 01:54:15,925
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2578
01:54:16,009 --> 01:54:17,468
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2579
01:54:17,552 --> 01:54:18,594
How about now?

2580
01:54:18,761 --> 01:54:20,138
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2581
01:54:21,889 --> 01:54:23,599
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2582
01:54:23,683 --> 01:54:25,351
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2583
01:54:25,435 --> 01:54:28,271
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2584
01:54:28,688 --> 01:54:30,857
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2585
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,066
Get down.

2586
01:54:32,859 --> 01:54:34,610
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2587
01:54:35,319 --> 01:54:36,738
Motherfucker!

2588
01:54:38,781 --> 01:54:39,824
Motherfucker!

2589
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,211
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2590
01:54:52,462 --> 01:54:55,048
- What's that?
- Twenty real Lemmons.

2591
01:54:55,131 --> 01:54:56,299
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2592
01:54:56,382 --> 01:54:57,550
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2593
01:54:57,633 --> 01:54:59,093
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2594
01:55:00,344 --> 01:55:02,221
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2595
01:55:02,305 --> 01:55:07,226
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,
the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

2596
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:08,811
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2597
01:55:08,895 --> 01:55:10,354
I thought they were like a myth.

2598
01:55:10,438 --> 01:55:12,315
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

2599
01:55:12,398 --> 01:55:13,441
Look at these babies.

2600
01:55:13,524 --> 01:55:16,110
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

2601
01:55:16,194 --> 01:55:18,279
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

2602
01:55:18,362 --> 01:55:20,948
<i>Like a birthday, or being clap free,</i>

2603
01:55:21,032 --> 01:55:23,993
<i>or our money arriving
safely in Switzerland.</i>

2604
01:55:27,413 --> 01:55:28,664
<i>So that night,</i>

2605
01:55:28,748 --> 01:55:30,583
<i>I cleared my schedule and I rid my body</i>

2606
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:33,169
<i>of anything that could fuck with my high.</i>

2607
01:55:33,878 --> 01:55:35,671
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2608
01:55:36,255 --> 01:55:37,423
Okay.

2609
01:55:37,507 --> 01:55:39,008
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2610
01:55:39,092 --> 01:55:40,843
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2611
01:55:40,927 --> 01:55:42,345
Here you go.

2612
01:55:43,054 --> 01:55:44,722
- <i>Salud!</i>
- Cheers.

2613
01:55:44,806 --> 01:55:47,600
<i>Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.</i>

2614
01:55:49,352 --> 01:55:50,603
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2615
01:55:50,686 --> 01:55:51,938
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2616
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:53,898
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

2617
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:57,693
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2618
01:55:57,777 --> 01:55:59,028
<i>Okay.</i>

2619
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:09,163
Do you feel anything?

2620
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:13,000
No.

2621
01:56:15,711 --> 01:56:17,547
It's been 35 minutes.

2622
01:56:20,049 --> 01:56:23,594
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2623
01:56:36,732 --> 01:56:38,151
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2624
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:41,404
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2625
01:56:41,487 --> 01:56:42,655
They're old.

2626
01:56:42,738 --> 01:56:44,907
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2627
01:56:44,991 --> 01:56:46,617
Check the bottle!

2628
01:56:49,453 --> 01:56:50,872
January '81.

2629
01:56:50,955 --> 01:56:52,039
They're fucking duds.

2630
01:56:52,123 --> 01:56:53,166
Fuck!

2631
01:56:53,249 --> 01:56:54,333
Let's take...

2632
01:56:54,417 --> 01:56:55,918
Let's take two more each.

2633
01:56:57,879 --> 01:57:00,423
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2634
01:57:04,093 --> 01:57:05,803
What are you two retards doing?

2635
01:57:05,887 --> 01:57:06,971
We're working out, honey.

2636
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:09,015
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2637
01:57:09,098 --> 01:57:10,099
Okay.

2638
01:57:10,183 --> 01:57:12,101
- Okay?
- Okay.

2639
01:57:13,603 --> 01:57:15,146
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2640
01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:16,355
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2641
01:57:16,439 --> 01:57:19,025
I cannot talk to you on this phone,
I have to talk to you.

2642
01:57:19,108 --> 01:57:20,610
<i>Get out of here. What's going on?</i>

2643
01:57:20,693 --> 01:57:24,030
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2644
01:57:24,113 --> 01:57:25,781
and then call me from a pay phone.

2645
01:57:25,865 --> 01:57:27,825
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2646
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:29,535
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2647
01:57:30,036 --> 01:57:31,370
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2648
01:57:31,454 --> 01:57:32,830
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2649
01:57:32,914 --> 01:57:34,874
- I gotta go!
- Ls everything okay, Jordan?

2650
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:47,053
<i>The closest pay phone I could get to</i>

2651
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,430
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

2652
01:57:50,097 --> 01:57:52,058
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2653
01:57:52,141 --> 01:57:54,727
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2654
01:58:04,195 --> 01:58:05,613
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2655
01:58:05,696 --> 01:58:06,739
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2656
01:58:06,822 --> 01:58:07,949
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2657
01:58:08,032 --> 01:58:11,786
Please. Your little friend there, Brad,
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2658
01:58:12,453 --> 01:58:13,746
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2659
01:58:13,829 --> 01:58:15,289
- What'd he do?
- <i>I don't know what he did.</i>

2660
01:58:15,373 --> 01:58:16,707
My friends in Long Island told me

2661
01:58:16,791 --> 01:58:19,001
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2662
01:58:19,085 --> 01:58:20,086
He got locked up by...

2663
01:58:20,169 --> 01:58:22,421
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2664
01:58:22,505 --> 01:58:23,798
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- He was with Donnie.

2665
01:58:23,881 --> 01:58:25,258
He was supposed to deliver some money,

2666
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:26,884
then that fucking fat piece of shit...
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

2667
01:58:26,968 --> 01:58:27,969
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2668
01:58:28,052 --> 01:58:29,971
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2669
01:58:30,054 --> 01:58:32,682
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2670
01:58:32,765 --> 01:58:35,059
somebody told me
he's got your phones tapped.

2671
01:58:35,142 --> 01:58:36,644
Your office and your home.

2672
01:58:36,727 --> 01:58:38,437
<i>Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!</i>

2673
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:40,439
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2674
01:58:40,898 --> 01:58:42,024
<i>Jordan.</i>

2675
01:58:42,566 --> 01:58:46,362
You didn't try to bribe
this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2676
01:58:46,445 --> 01:58:48,489
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2677
01:58:48,572 --> 01:58:50,116
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2678
01:58:50,199 --> 01:58:52,076
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2679
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:53,327
<i>Say that again.</i>

2680
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:56,205
I said...

2681
01:58:56,872 --> 01:58:58,791
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2682
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:00,376
I said...

2683
01:59:00,459 --> 01:59:01,919
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2684
01:59:04,547 --> 01:59:07,174
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2685
01:59:08,009 --> 01:59:10,136
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2686
01:59:10,219 --> 01:59:11,846
<i>Don't get behind the wheel of the car.</i>

2687
01:59:11,929 --> 01:59:13,472
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2688
01:59:13,556 --> 01:59:14,807
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2689
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:17,143
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2690
01:59:17,226 --> 01:59:20,187
<i>the Lemmons had
developed a delayed fuse.</i>

2691
01:59:20,271 --> 01:59:22,940
<i>It took 90 minutes for
these little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2692
01:59:23,024 --> 01:59:24,400
<i>But once they did...</i>

2693
01:59:25,943 --> 01:59:27,486
<i>I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase</i>

2694
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,488
<i>and went straight to the drool phase.</i>

2695
01:59:29,572 --> 01:59:31,532
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2696
01:59:31,615 --> 01:59:33,534
<i>These little bastards were so strong,</i>

2697
01:59:33,617 --> 01:59:35,661
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2698
01:59:35,745 --> 01:59:37,788
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2699
01:59:40,082 --> 01:59:42,084
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2700
01:59:46,047 --> 01:59:47,965
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2701
01:59:48,924 --> 01:59:51,802
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2702
01:59:52,636 --> 01:59:56,349
<i>Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2703
02:00:28,005 --> 02:00:30,966
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy!</i>

2704
02:00:38,015 --> 02:00:40,393
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2705
02:00:40,476 --> 02:00:41,811
<i>Yes!</i>

2706
02:00:41,894 --> 02:00:43,979
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2707
02:00:44,397 --> 02:00:46,565
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

2708
02:02:08,898 --> 02:02:10,149
<i>Jordan.</i>

2709
02:02:11,734 --> 02:02:13,068
<i>Jordan.</i>

2710
02:02:13,444 --> 02:02:15,112
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

2711
02:02:15,196 --> 02:02:16,655
I'm at a country club!

2712
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:17,781
<i>What?</i>

2713
02:02:17,865 --> 02:02:20,701
I'm at a country club!

2714
02:02:20,784 --> 02:02:22,119
<i>I don't know what
the fuck you're saying.</i>

2715
02:02:22,203 --> 02:02:23,454
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2716
02:02:23,537 --> 02:02:26,165
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2717
02:02:26,248 --> 02:02:28,125
<i>with some Swiss guy. I don't know...</i>

2718
02:02:28,209 --> 02:02:29,210
What?

2719
02:02:29,293 --> 02:02:32,254
Get him off the phone!

2720
02:02:32,588 --> 02:02:35,341
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2721
02:02:35,424 --> 02:02:36,675
Get him

2722
02:02:36,759 --> 02:02:37,801
off

2723
02:02:37,885 --> 02:02:39,011
the phone!

2724
02:02:39,094 --> 02:02:40,346
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2725
02:02:40,429 --> 02:02:41,764
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2726
02:02:51,607 --> 02:02:53,734
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

2727
02:02:53,817 --> 02:02:56,529
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2728
02:02:56,612 --> 02:02:58,614
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2729
02:02:58,697 --> 02:03:01,116
<i>I was gonna give you two million.</i>

2730
02:03:01,283 --> 02:03:03,827
I's gonna be lates.

2731
02:03:04,495 --> 02:03:06,080
You ate two million?

2732
02:03:06,997 --> 02:03:08,249
Later.

2733
02:03:08,332 --> 02:03:09,458
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2734
02:03:09,542 --> 02:03:11,043
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2735
02:03:12,419 --> 02:03:14,505
Get out of the way, asshole!

2736
02:03:17,174 --> 02:03:18,425
You hate two million?

2737
02:03:18,509 --> 02:03:20,010
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2738
02:03:22,555 --> 02:03:25,432
<i>By some miracle, I made it home alive,</i>

2739
02:03:25,516 --> 02:03:27,810
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2740
02:03:37,236 --> 02:03:38,320
Jordan?

2741
02:03:38,821 --> 02:03:41,407
Jesus fucking Christ!

2742
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,992
What did you take?

2743
02:03:43,075 --> 02:03:44,368
What's wrong with you?

2744
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:45,452
Jor!

2745
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,913
It's fucking good, right?

2746
02:03:47,997 --> 02:03:49,331
Fucked up!

2747
02:03:50,666 --> 02:03:52,501
Get off the phone!

2748
02:03:55,546 --> 02:03:57,756
What the fuck, Jordan?

2749
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,425
Your daughter's in the house!

2750
02:03:59,508 --> 02:04:00,593
I hope you know that!

2751
02:04:00,676 --> 02:04:02,011
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2752
02:04:02,511 --> 02:04:03,846
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2753
02:04:04,054 --> 02:04:06,473
Get off the phone!

2754
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:08,601
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2755
02:04:08,684 --> 02:04:10,352
The FBI!

2756
02:04:11,687 --> 02:04:12,938
Hey!

2757
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,357
I'm on phone!

2758
02:04:15,566 --> 02:04:17,943
Get off the fucking phone!

2759
02:04:19,695 --> 02:04:21,697
- Come here!
- The phone.

2760
02:04:23,782 --> 02:04:26,910
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, all right.

2761
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,292
I'm on the phone!

2762
02:04:33,375 --> 02:04:34,710
On the phone!

2763
02:04:34,793 --> 02:04:36,879
I know what you did,

2764
02:04:37,379 --> 02:04:38,797
you piece of shit!

2765
02:04:38,881 --> 02:04:40,591
What? What?

2766
02:04:40,674 --> 02:04:42,009
Brad!

2767
02:04:43,719 --> 02:04:45,179
Brad!

2768
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:46,889
Brad!

2769
02:04:46,972 --> 02:04:49,391
You fucking cocksucker!

2770
02:04:53,729 --> 02:04:55,606
What did you do,

2771
02:04:55,689 --> 02:04:57,483
you piece of shit?

2772
02:04:57,566 --> 02:04:58,984
Fuck you!

2773
02:05:00,235 --> 02:05:02,529
I wanna fucking kill you!

2774
02:05:02,613 --> 02:05:04,782
I wanna fucking kill you!

2775
02:05:05,741 --> 02:05:07,076
I got you!

2776
02:05:31,642 --> 02:05:33,560
What the fuck happened?

2777
02:05:34,019 --> 02:05:35,270
Oh, shit!

2778
02:05:35,354 --> 02:05:37,231
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2779
02:05:37,398 --> 02:05:38,982
Donnie? Donnie?

2780
02:05:39,316 --> 02:05:40,401
Donnie?

2781
02:05:40,484 --> 02:05:41,819
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2782
02:05:41,902 --> 02:05:43,696
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2783
02:05:43,779 --> 02:05:45,030
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2784
02:05:45,114 --> 02:05:46,448
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2785
02:05:48,492 --> 02:05:51,036
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2786
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,871
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2787
02:05:53,455 --> 02:05:56,333
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2788
02:05:57,251 --> 02:05:59,545
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2789
02:06:01,463 --> 02:06:02,798
I got you.

2790
02:06:22,151 --> 02:06:23,736
Step aside!

2791
02:06:23,986 --> 02:06:25,362
Oh, God!

2792
02:06:25,821 --> 02:06:27,281
Oh, God!

2793
02:06:27,656 --> 02:06:29,408
Move aside, baby.

2794
02:06:36,373 --> 02:06:38,167
Come on! Come on!

2795
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,460
Come on!

2796
02:06:44,006 --> 02:06:46,675
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2797
02:06:47,718 --> 02:06:49,762
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2798
02:06:49,845 --> 02:06:51,513
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2799
02:06:57,186 --> 02:06:58,270
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2800
02:06:58,353 --> 02:07:00,272
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2801
02:07:00,355 --> 02:07:01,523
I don't fucking know!

2802
02:07:01,607 --> 02:07:03,358
Just get over here! Call 911.

2803
02:07:11,408 --> 02:07:12,409
Yeah.

2804
02:07:13,952 --> 02:07:16,288
You all right? He's all right.

2805
02:07:29,468 --> 02:07:31,553
Mr. Belfort?

2806
02:07:32,513 --> 02:07:33,972
Mr. Belfort?

2807
02:07:36,642 --> 02:07:39,561
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2808
02:07:39,645 --> 02:07:42,147
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2809
02:07:42,815 --> 02:07:44,775
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2810
02:07:44,858 --> 02:07:45,984
Come on, get up.

2811
02:07:46,068 --> 02:07:47,611
Get the fuck out of my house.

2812
02:07:49,404 --> 02:07:51,114
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2813
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:52,699
I been sitting here all night.

2814
02:07:52,783 --> 02:07:54,159
What the fuck are you talking about?

2815
02:07:54,243 --> 02:07:56,203
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2816
02:07:56,286 --> 02:07:57,371
Where you taking him?

2817
02:07:57,454 --> 02:07:58,497
You ain't got no warrant.

2818
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,873
Just come up
in people's house like that!

2819
02:08:01,041 --> 02:08:03,335
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2820
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,963
Well?

2821
02:08:09,258 --> 02:08:10,634
<i>Wow!</i>

2822
02:08:10,926 --> 02:08:12,719
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

2823
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,237
Get out of the fucking way!

2824
02:08:32,197 --> 02:08:33,448
Fuck!

2825
02:08:39,079 --> 02:08:42,708
Did you drive that car tonight?

2826
02:08:43,834 --> 02:08:45,961
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2827
02:08:46,044 --> 02:08:47,838
I'm a family man!

2828
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:49,673
Family man. Honey!

2829
02:08:49,756 --> 02:08:51,717
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

2830
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,803
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

2831
02:08:54,887 --> 02:08:58,056
<i>The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2832
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:00,559
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2833
02:09:00,642 --> 02:09:01,727
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2834
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:03,896
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2835
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:06,565
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

2836
02:09:06,648 --> 02:09:09,359
<i>The result, I was scat-free.</i>

2837
02:09:09,443 --> 02:09:11,820
<i>But I had eyes on me like never before.</i>

2838
02:09:11,904 --> 02:09:13,572
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2839
02:09:13,655 --> 02:09:16,575
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2840
02:09:16,658 --> 02:09:18,243
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

2841
02:09:18,327 --> 02:09:19,661
But it's time.

2842
02:09:19,745 --> 02:09:21,997
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

2843
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,999
before your luck runs out.

2844
02:09:24,082 --> 02:09:25,667
Wave to Daddy.

2845
02:09:25,751 --> 02:09:26,835
Hey.

2846
02:09:26,919 --> 02:09:28,420
Hey, sweetie.

2847
02:09:33,634 --> 02:09:36,929
What kind of terms
would you be talking about if I...

2848
02:09:37,012 --> 02:09:38,221
I don't know.

2849
02:09:38,305 --> 02:09:41,266
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

2850
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,394
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

2851
02:09:44,478 --> 02:09:47,272
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

2852
02:09:47,356 --> 02:09:49,316
You pay a couple
million dollars in fines,

2853
02:09:49,399 --> 02:09:52,361
in exchange, the SEC
fucks off till the end of time.

2854
02:09:54,696 --> 02:09:56,323
And Stratton?

2855
02:09:56,823 --> 02:09:58,700
What happens to Stratton?

2856
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:01,620
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

2857
02:10:01,703 --> 02:10:02,829
Let Donnie be in charge.

2858
02:10:02,913 --> 02:10:04,539
Right. Donnie.

2859
02:10:05,248 --> 02:10:07,417
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

2860
02:10:07,501 --> 02:10:09,294
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2861
02:10:09,378 --> 02:10:12,130
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,

2862
02:10:12,214 --> 02:10:14,132
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

2863
02:10:14,216 --> 02:10:16,551
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2864
02:10:17,678 --> 02:10:18,971
Jordan.

2865
02:10:19,054 --> 02:10:20,973
What do you have to think about?

2866
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:22,641
You beat them.

2867
02:10:22,724 --> 02:10:23,850
You won!

2868
02:10:23,934 --> 02:10:25,560
God knows you never have to work again.

2869
02:10:25,644 --> 02:10:27,646
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

2870
02:10:27,729 --> 02:10:28,814
- Is that what you want?
- No.

2871
02:10:28,897 --> 02:10:29,940
- Of course not.
- Okay.

2872
02:10:30,023 --> 02:10:32,067
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

2873
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,735
You need everybody else's money?

2874
02:10:33,819 --> 02:10:35,237
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

2875
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,656
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

2876
02:10:37,739 --> 02:10:39,449
You built it, so now preserve it.

2877
02:11:10,689 --> 02:11:12,107
You know,

2878
02:11:12,482 --> 02:11:15,193
five years ago,
when I started Stratton Oakmont

2879
02:11:15,277 --> 02:11:17,362
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

2880
02:11:17,446 --> 02:11:20,741
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2881
02:11:22,701 --> 02:11:26,496
And it's truly with a heavy heart
that I'm here to say that...

2882
02:11:28,123 --> 02:11:30,292
That that day is finally here.

2883
02:11:34,504 --> 02:11:36,798
I wanna... I want
to thank you all for your...

2884
02:11:36,882 --> 02:11:39,551
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

2885
02:11:39,634 --> 02:11:41,094
But the point is this.

2886
02:11:42,054 --> 02:11:43,305
Under Donnie's leadership,

2887
02:11:43,388 --> 02:11:46,850
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

2888
02:11:46,933 --> 02:11:49,728
moving into key management positions,
this place really

2889
02:11:49,811 --> 02:11:51,146
is gonna be better than ever!

2890
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:53,356
That I promise you. Okay?

2891
02:11:53,732 --> 02:11:56,234
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

2892
02:11:59,321 --> 02:12:02,074
This is Ellis Island here, people.

2893
02:12:02,157 --> 02:12:03,825
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

2894
02:12:03,909 --> 02:12:06,411
whether your relatives
came over on the fucking <i>Mayflower</i>

2895
02:12:06,495 --> 02:12:08,663
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

2896
02:12:08,747 --> 02:12:10,999
this right here is the land of opportunity.

2897
02:12:11,083 --> 02:12:13,585
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2898
02:12:17,631 --> 02:12:19,257
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

2899
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:20,550
Yes, we do.

2900
02:12:20,634 --> 02:12:21,760
Fuck you.

2901
02:12:22,427 --> 02:12:23,637
Come on, Kimmie.

2902
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,263
What you probably didn't know is,

2903
02:12:25,347 --> 02:12:27,140
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

2904
02:12:27,224 --> 02:12:29,518
one of Stratton's original 20.

2905
02:12:30,268 --> 02:12:32,104
Now most of you met Kimmie,

2906
02:12:32,187 --> 02:12:35,190
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2907
02:12:35,607 --> 02:12:38,693
A woman that wears $3,000 Armani suits.

2908
02:12:40,695 --> 02:12:43,240
Who drives a brand-new Mercedes Benz.

2909
02:12:43,949 --> 02:12:45,784
A woman who spends

2910
02:12:45,867 --> 02:12:47,285
her winters in the Bahamas

2911
02:12:47,369 --> 02:12:49,496
and summers in the Hamptons!

2912
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:56,837
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

2913
02:12:59,673 --> 02:13:03,426
The Kimmie that I met
didn't have two nickels to rub together.

2914
02:13:04,678 --> 02:13:06,930
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

2915
02:13:07,013 --> 02:13:08,807
with an eight-year-old son.

2916
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:11,893
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

2917
02:13:12,978 --> 02:13:16,648
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

2918
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:18,942
she asked for a $5,000 advance

2919
02:13:19,025 --> 02:13:22,195
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

2920
02:13:26,658 --> 02:13:28,368
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

2921
02:13:28,451 --> 02:13:30,162
Go on, tell them.

2922
02:13:31,913 --> 02:13:33,957
You wrote me a check

2923
02:13:34,207 --> 02:13:36,293
for $25,000.

2924
02:13:37,586 --> 02:13:39,045
That's right.

2925
02:13:39,171 --> 02:13:40,505
Thank you.

2926
02:13:43,925 --> 02:13:45,677
And you know why that is?

2927
02:13:49,014 --> 02:13:51,308
It's because I believed in you.

2928
02:13:53,018 --> 02:13:55,729
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

2929
02:13:56,146 --> 02:14:00,025
just like I believe in each
and every one of you here today.

2930
02:14:00,108 --> 02:14:02,527
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

2931
02:14:02,611 --> 02:14:04,404
I fucking love you! I love you.

2932
02:14:04,487 --> 02:14:07,282
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

2933
02:14:10,202 --> 02:14:12,204
And I love all of you!

2934
02:14:12,787 --> 02:14:15,123
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

2935
02:14:15,207 --> 02:14:17,667
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

2936
02:14:18,501 --> 02:14:20,795
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

2937
02:14:27,302 --> 02:14:29,471
It's a shame, you know.

2938
02:14:31,056 --> 02:14:35,185
For years, I've been telling you guys
never to take no for an answer, right?

2939
02:14:35,268 --> 02:14:38,480
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

2940
02:14:39,397 --> 02:14:41,650
until you get what you want.

2941
02:14:42,525 --> 02:14:44,277
Because you all deserve it.

2942
02:14:46,321 --> 02:14:49,491
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

2943
02:14:49,991 --> 02:14:52,118
barring me from the securities industry,

2944
02:14:52,202 --> 02:14:54,246
barring me from Stratton,

2945
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:56,748
my home.

2946
02:14:59,501 --> 02:15:01,503
What the fuck is that, you know?

2947
02:15:02,712 --> 02:15:05,048
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

2948
02:15:05,799 --> 02:15:08,593
It's me taking no
for an answer, you know.

2949
02:15:10,095 --> 02:15:11,346
It's them...

2950
02:15:11,429 --> 02:15:14,683
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

2951
02:15:15,433 --> 02:15:18,144
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

2952
02:15:23,316 --> 02:15:24,567
So...

2953
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,243
You know what?

2954
02:15:37,038 --> 02:15:38,665
I'm not leaving.

2955
02:15:41,001 --> 02:15:42,252
I'm not leaving.

2956
02:15:45,213 --> 02:15:46,381
I'm not fucking leaving!

2957
02:15:51,428 --> 02:15:53,847
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

2958
02:15:55,223 --> 02:15:56,558
The show goes on!

2959
02:15:59,185 --> 02:16:00,603
This is my home!

2960
02:16:00,687 --> 02:16:03,440
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

2961
02:16:03,523 --> 02:16:05,400
to take me out of here!

2962
02:16:07,402 --> 02:16:09,904
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

2963
02:16:09,988 --> 02:16:11,740
or fucking SWAT team

2964
02:16:11,823 --> 02:16:14,326
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

2965
02:16:17,162 --> 02:16:18,204
Fuck them!

2966
02:16:20,665 --> 02:16:22,417
Fuck them!

2967
02:16:56,534 --> 02:16:58,328
Jordy! Jordy!

2968
02:16:58,453 --> 02:17:00,455
Jordy! Get back here!

2969
02:17:01,289 --> 02:17:02,457
Hey!

2970
02:17:04,918 --> 02:17:06,169
Give me that.

2971
02:17:08,671 --> 02:17:09,798
What is this?

2972
02:17:09,881 --> 02:17:12,384
<i>Ramar of the Jungle</i>, for Christ sake?

2973
02:17:13,468 --> 02:17:16,388
<i>Paddy D,</i> mazel tov, <i>you Irishman.</i>

2974
02:17:16,471 --> 02:17:19,933
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

2975
02:17:20,016 --> 02:17:22,685
<i>He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.</i>

2976
02:17:35,615 --> 02:17:37,909
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

2977
02:17:37,992 --> 02:17:40,620
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

2978
02:17:41,454 --> 02:17:45,417
<i>I apologized, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.</i>

2979
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,086
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

2980
02:17:48,169 --> 02:17:50,046
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

2981
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,756
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

2982
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,051
<i>two years later he was dead.</i>

2983
02:17:55,218 --> 02:17:57,637
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

2984
02:17:58,430 --> 02:18:00,765
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

2985
02:18:00,849 --> 02:18:04,102
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

2986
02:18:04,185 --> 02:18:06,521
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

2987
02:18:08,690 --> 02:18:12,277
<i>Within days, subpoenas started flying.</i>

2988
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:15,697
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

2989
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,782
<i>Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.</i>

2990
02:18:17,866 --> 02:18:20,326
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

2991
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:23,705
Here's what we do
with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

2992
02:18:29,461 --> 02:18:32,088
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

2993
02:18:32,172 --> 02:18:34,048
Fuck you! Fuck you!

2994
02:18:34,132 --> 02:18:35,925
Fuck you!

2995
02:18:43,683 --> 02:18:45,727
Jordan Belfort.

2996
02:18:45,810 --> 02:18:47,687
Alden. That's a nice name.

2997
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:49,063
Thank you very much for that.

2998
02:18:49,147 --> 02:18:51,316
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

2999
02:18:51,399 --> 02:18:53,067
I do not recall that.

3000
02:18:53,151 --> 02:18:55,487
I do not recall that. Okay?

3001
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:57,739
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

3002
02:18:57,822 --> 02:18:59,449
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3003
02:18:59,532 --> 02:19:00,742
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3004
02:19:00,825 --> 02:19:02,494
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3005
02:19:02,577 --> 02:19:04,204
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

3006
02:19:04,287 --> 02:19:05,455
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3007
02:19:05,538 --> 02:19:07,582
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3008
02:19:07,665 --> 02:19:09,209
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

3009
02:19:09,292 --> 02:19:11,753
<i>But not a single Strattonite cracked.</i>

3010
02:19:11,836 --> 02:19:13,505
Gladys Carrera?

3011
02:19:13,588 --> 02:19:15,131
Doesn't ring a bell.

3012
02:19:15,215 --> 02:19:17,842
Sorry, I have
no recommendation of that.

3013
02:19:18,009 --> 02:19:19,010
No.

3014
02:19:19,093 --> 02:19:20,094
No idea.

3015
02:19:20,178 --> 02:19:22,680
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3016
02:19:22,764 --> 02:19:25,016
Absolutely not.

3017
02:19:25,099 --> 02:19:26,935
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3018
02:19:27,018 --> 02:19:29,229
I just thought you might remember that.

3019
02:19:29,312 --> 02:19:30,813
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3020
02:19:30,897 --> 02:19:32,649
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3021
02:19:32,732 --> 02:19:34,901
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3022
02:19:34,984 --> 02:19:36,653
It was a long phone call.

3023
02:19:36,736 --> 02:19:38,404
I just wondered if you have
any memory of that.

3024
02:19:38,488 --> 02:19:41,658
Okay. You know we've talked to
several of the employees at this firm

3025
02:19:41,741 --> 02:19:45,036
and nobody can recall anything
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3026
02:19:45,119 --> 02:19:46,371
I think it's odd.

3027
02:19:48,248 --> 02:19:50,750
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3028
02:19:52,252 --> 02:19:53,503
You do recall it?

3029
02:19:53,586 --> 02:19:54,879
No, I don't recall that at all.

3030
02:19:55,463 --> 02:19:58,383
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3031
02:19:59,008 --> 02:20:01,135
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3032
02:20:01,219 --> 02:20:02,512
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3033
02:20:02,595 --> 02:20:04,305
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3034
02:20:04,389 --> 02:20:06,057
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3035
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:07,976
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3036
02:20:10,061 --> 02:20:11,813
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3037
02:20:11,896 --> 02:20:13,731
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3038
02:20:13,815 --> 02:20:17,235
which requires me to drink one of those
every 15 minutes, please.

3039
02:20:17,694 --> 02:20:20,822
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3040
02:20:20,905 --> 02:20:22,949
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3041
02:20:23,324 --> 02:20:25,743
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3042
02:20:25,827 --> 02:20:27,203
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3043
02:20:27,287 --> 02:20:29,455
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

3044
02:20:29,539 --> 02:20:31,541
<i>I was still running Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3045
02:20:31,624 --> 02:20:32,875
Hey, Rugrat.

3046
02:20:32,959 --> 02:20:34,127
<i>Bonjour.</i>

3047
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:36,212
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3048
02:20:36,296 --> 02:20:37,255
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3049
02:20:37,338 --> 02:20:38,631
We have a problem, okay.

3050
02:20:38,715 --> 02:20:41,968
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3051
02:20:42,051 --> 02:20:44,095
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3052
02:20:44,178 --> 02:20:45,763
<i>- What's</i> going <i>on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3053
02:20:45,847 --> 02:20:48,308
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3054
02:20:48,391 --> 02:20:49,517
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3055
02:20:49,601 --> 02:20:51,936
Give me that goddamn phone.

3056
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,563
What's going on?

3057
02:20:53,771 --> 02:20:55,857
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3058
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,651
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3059
02:20:58,735 --> 02:21:00,778
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3060
02:21:00,862 --> 02:21:02,905
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3061
02:21:02,989 --> 02:21:03,948
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3062
02:21:04,032 --> 02:21:06,367
Donnie, your little friend
is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3063
02:21:06,492 --> 02:21:08,202
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3064
02:21:08,286 --> 02:21:09,871
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3065
02:21:09,954 --> 02:21:11,331
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3066
02:21:11,831 --> 02:21:13,541
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3067
02:21:13,625 --> 02:21:16,669
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3068
02:21:16,753 --> 02:21:19,005
<i>the shares were in his fucking name.</i>

3069
02:21:19,088 --> 02:21:21,299
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3070
02:21:21,382 --> 02:21:23,176
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3071
02:21:23,259 --> 02:21:24,761
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3072
02:21:24,844 --> 02:21:26,596
I want you to get
all our clients on the phone right now

3073
02:21:26,679 --> 02:21:27,972
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3074
02:21:28,056 --> 02:21:29,515
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3075
02:21:29,599 --> 02:21:31,100
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3076
02:21:31,225 --> 02:21:32,852
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3077
02:21:33,019 --> 02:21:35,104
<i>If that little fucking prick
thinks he can fuck with me,</i>

3078
02:21:35,188 --> 02:21:37,774
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3079
02:21:37,857 --> 02:21:39,275
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3080
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:42,278
<i>Let's just not jump to conclusions
before we know what's going on.</i>

3081
02:21:42,362 --> 02:21:43,738
Captain Ted!

3082
02:21:43,821 --> 02:21:44,906
Captain Ted!

3083
02:21:45,406 --> 02:21:47,784
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3084
02:21:47,867 --> 02:21:50,620
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3085
02:21:53,748 --> 02:21:56,125
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3086
02:21:56,417 --> 02:21:57,669
I just...

3087
02:21:58,086 --> 02:21:59,337
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3088
02:22:00,463 --> 02:22:02,090
Aunt Emma...

3089
02:22:02,965 --> 02:22:04,258
Just wait.

3090
02:22:04,676 --> 02:22:06,302
I can't...

3091
02:22:06,386 --> 02:22:09,263
What's going on? Why you crying?

3092
02:22:09,347 --> 02:22:11,391
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3093
02:22:11,474 --> 02:22:13,851
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3094
02:22:13,935 --> 02:22:15,019
Yeah?

3095
02:22:15,103 --> 02:22:16,813
Aunt Emma is dead.

3096
02:22:18,231 --> 02:22:20,942
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3097
02:22:21,275 --> 02:22:22,443
You're serious?

3098
02:22:23,236 --> 02:22:25,530
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3099
02:22:25,613 --> 02:22:27,073
Oh, fuck!

3100
02:22:27,156 --> 02:22:28,950
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3101
02:22:29,033 --> 02:22:30,368
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3102
02:22:30,451 --> 02:22:32,036
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3103
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,955
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3104
02:22:34,038 --> 02:22:37,375
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3105
02:22:37,458 --> 02:22:39,544
The last time I talked
to her she was fine!

3106
02:22:39,627 --> 02:22:41,796
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3107
02:22:41,879 --> 02:22:44,048
That's so fucking terrible!

3108
02:22:44,132 --> 02:22:45,842
Oh, fuck!

3109
02:22:45,925 --> 02:22:46,926
It is terrible.

3110
02:22:47,009 --> 02:22:49,554
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3111
02:22:49,637 --> 02:22:51,556
My condolences to you and your family.

3112
02:22:51,639 --> 02:22:52,974
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3113
02:22:53,057 --> 02:22:55,059
Thank you so much for your condolences.

3114
02:22:55,143 --> 02:22:58,062
Now where does that leave us
in regard to her account exactly?

3115
02:22:58,146 --> 02:22:59,647
Does it go into probate or what?

3116
02:22:59,731 --> 02:23:01,315
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3117
02:23:01,399 --> 02:23:03,067
Your aunt, before she died,

3118
02:23:03,151 --> 02:23:06,070
signed a document
naming you as her successor.

3119
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,822
She did?

3120
02:23:07,905 --> 02:23:09,532
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3121
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,993
Well, not as of yet.

3122
02:23:12,326 --> 02:23:14,328
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3123
02:23:16,748 --> 02:23:18,458
I can't seem to hear you.

3124
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:21,252
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3125
02:23:21,419 --> 02:23:24,088
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
<i>- Fast?</i>

3126
02:23:24,172 --> 02:23:26,299
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3127
02:23:28,009 --> 02:23:30,094
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3128
02:23:30,178 --> 02:23:31,471
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3129
02:23:31,554 --> 02:23:33,014
Take your suit, take your dick, okay,

3130
02:23:33,097 --> 02:23:34,807
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3131
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,893
Move my ass! Yes!

3132
02:23:36,976 --> 02:23:41,105
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3133
02:23:41,189 --> 02:23:43,107
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3134
02:23:43,191 --> 02:23:45,193
<i>who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.</i>

3135
02:23:45,276 --> 02:23:46,819
You American shit!

3136
02:23:46,986 --> 02:23:50,364
<i>I just had to get there by tomorrow,
or lose $20 million.</i>

3137
02:23:50,448 --> 02:23:52,158
We're going to Monaco!

3138
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,994
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3139
02:23:55,077 --> 02:23:57,663
We're going to Monaco,
so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3140
02:23:57,747 --> 02:23:59,457
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3141
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:02,460
But I have business in Switzerland.
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3142
02:24:02,543 --> 02:24:04,629
Bottom line. Sorry.

3143
02:24:04,921 --> 02:24:06,714
We gotta get to London.

3144
02:24:07,215 --> 02:24:08,466
Why? Why?

3145
02:24:09,967 --> 02:24:11,135
The funeral!

3146
02:24:11,219 --> 02:24:12,553
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3147
02:24:13,054 --> 02:24:15,807
I loved your aunt
more than anyone in the entire world.

3148
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,391
I really did.

3149
02:24:17,892 --> 02:24:20,144
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3150
02:24:20,228 --> 02:24:22,438
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3151
02:24:22,522 --> 02:24:24,899
She'll still be dead by the time
we get to London, okay?

3152
02:24:25,566 --> 02:24:27,318
Captain Ted!
Captain Ted, all right, look.

3153
02:24:27,401 --> 02:24:29,195
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3154
02:24:29,278 --> 02:24:30,321
Monaco, right.

3155
02:24:30,404 --> 02:24:32,281
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3156
02:24:32,365 --> 02:24:33,658
so they don't stamp our passports.

3157
02:24:33,741 --> 02:24:35,618
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3158
02:24:35,701 --> 02:24:37,370
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3159
02:24:37,453 --> 02:24:38,955
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3160
02:24:39,038 --> 02:24:40,206
That's the fucking plan.

3161
02:24:40,289 --> 02:24:42,667
I just want you to know that
we might run into some chop.

3162
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,961
Chop? We can fucking
handle chop, right?

3163
02:24:45,044 --> 02:24:46,462
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3164
02:24:46,546 --> 02:24:49,298
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
unless he says it's safe, all right.

3165
02:24:49,382 --> 02:24:50,800
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3166
02:24:50,883 --> 02:24:52,218
You don't know shit about chop.

3167
02:24:52,301 --> 02:24:54,512
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3168
02:24:54,595 --> 02:24:56,931
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half.
How about that?

3169
02:24:57,014 --> 02:24:58,891
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3170
02:24:58,975 --> 02:25:00,685
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3171
02:25:02,019 --> 02:25:03,855
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3172
02:25:03,938 --> 02:25:05,106
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3173
02:25:05,189 --> 02:25:06,774
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3174
02:25:06,858 --> 02:25:08,025
It's gonna be safe.

3175
02:25:08,109 --> 02:25:11,696
We'll batten down the hatches
and secure the deck.

3176
02:25:11,779 --> 02:25:15,491
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3177
02:25:15,575 --> 02:25:16,701
Few broken dishes.

3178
02:25:16,784 --> 02:25:17,994
What's a few broken dishes?

3179
02:25:18,077 --> 02:25:19,370
Does that sound fucking awesome
or what?

3180
02:25:19,453 --> 02:25:20,830
No. Not really.

3181
02:25:20,913 --> 02:25:22,206
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3182
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,041
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3183
02:25:24,125 --> 02:25:25,293
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3184
02:25:30,715 --> 02:25:31,757
Hold on!

3185
02:25:34,927 --> 02:25:37,930
What the fuck is going on out here?

3186
02:25:38,014 --> 02:25:40,641
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3187
02:25:40,725 --> 02:25:42,727
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3188
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,937
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3189
02:25:45,021 --> 02:25:47,815
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3190
02:25:47,899 --> 02:25:49,567
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3191
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,860
- We can't!
- Go!

3192
02:25:50,943 --> 02:25:53,529
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3193
02:25:53,613 --> 02:25:55,406
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3194
02:25:55,489 --> 02:25:56,532
I'm a master diver!

3195
02:25:56,616 --> 02:25:57,867
No one's gonna fucking die!

3196
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:00,578
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3197
02:26:00,661 --> 02:26:01,913
I love you.

3198
02:26:01,996 --> 02:26:03,915
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3199
02:26:03,998 --> 02:26:05,041
Okay.

3200
02:26:05,124 --> 02:26:06,167
Donnie!

3201
02:26:07,752 --> 02:26:08,961
Hold on, baby!

3202
02:26:09,045 --> 02:26:10,046
Donnie!

3203
02:26:12,089 --> 02:26:13,132
Donnie!

3204
02:26:13,633 --> 02:26:15,009
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3205
02:26:15,092 --> 02:26:16,594
Get the fucking ludes.

3206
02:26:16,677 --> 02:26:17,845
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3207
02:26:17,929 --> 02:26:20,640
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3208
02:26:20,723 --> 02:26:23,601
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3209
02:26:23,684 --> 02:26:25,686
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3210
02:26:25,895 --> 02:26:27,104
What are you saying?

3211
02:26:27,605 --> 02:26:29,023
Fuck!

3212
02:26:29,899 --> 02:26:31,108
Get the ludes!

3213
02:26:31,192 --> 02:26:32,777
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3214
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,111
It's three feet of water down there!

3215
02:26:34,195 --> 02:26:36,948
I will not die sober!

3216
02:26:37,031 --> 02:26:38,783
Get those fucking ludes!

3217
02:26:38,866 --> 02:26:39,909
Okay!

3218
02:26:39,992 --> 02:26:41,327
- Go!
- Okay.

3219
02:26:44,205 --> 02:26:45,957
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3220
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,625
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3221
02:26:47,708 --> 02:26:48,834
He's just warning everybody!

3222
02:27:01,055 --> 02:27:02,765
Jesus Christ!

3223
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,518
Hold on!

3224
02:27:05,601 --> 02:27:07,061
Get away from the window!

3225
02:27:07,144 --> 02:27:08,521
Rogue wave!

3226
02:27:08,604 --> 02:27:09,647
Mayday!

3227
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:12,316
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht <i>Naomi!</i>

3228
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,901
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3229
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,569
I got 'em!

3230
02:27:16,737 --> 02:27:18,280
Give me one for the nerves!

3231
02:27:18,364 --> 02:27:19,490
We're going down!

3232
02:27:19,573 --> 02:27:21,784
This is a fucking Mayday!

3233
02:27:21,867 --> 02:27:23,953
We require immediate assistance!

3234
02:27:26,205 --> 02:27:27,206
Hold on!

3235
02:27:27,289 --> 02:27:28,499
Watch out!

3236
02:27:40,177 --> 02:27:42,722
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3237
02:27:43,014 --> 02:27:46,559
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3238
02:27:46,642 --> 02:27:48,602
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3239
02:28:05,202 --> 02:28:06,871
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3240
02:28:07,288 --> 02:28:10,207
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3241
02:28:11,125 --> 02:28:14,879
<i>I shit you not, it exploded
when a seagull flew into the engine.</i>

3242
02:28:14,962 --> 02:28:16,964
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3243
02:28:21,135 --> 02:28:22,970
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3244
02:28:23,054 --> 02:28:26,140
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3245
02:28:31,604 --> 02:28:35,232
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3246
02:28:35,316 --> 02:28:37,985
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3247
02:28:38,069 --> 02:28:42,156
Would you like to own a home like this,
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3248
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,951
My name is Jordan Belfort,
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3249
02:28:46,035 --> 02:28:48,537
No matter who you are,
no matter where you came from,

3250
02:28:48,621 --> 02:28:51,207
you too can become
financially independent

3251
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:53,042
in just a matter of months.

3252
02:28:53,125 --> 02:28:55,252
All you need is a strategy.

3253
02:28:55,336 --> 02:28:56,962
When I was 24 years old,

3254
02:28:57,046 --> 02:29:00,883
I made a decision
not just to survive, but to thrive.

3255
02:29:00,966 --> 02:29:03,427
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3256
02:29:03,511 --> 02:29:06,931
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3257
02:29:07,014 --> 02:29:08,140
I certainly believe now.

3258
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:09,642
Think about it for a second.

3259
02:29:09,725 --> 02:29:11,852
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3260
02:29:11,936 --> 02:29:14,105
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3261
02:29:14,188 --> 02:29:15,773
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3262
02:29:15,856 --> 02:29:19,610
<i>If you want to be a millionaire someday,
have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3263
02:29:19,693 --> 02:29:22,446
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
because I worked hard for it.

3264
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,074
And if it doesn't work for you,
it's because you're lazy.

3265
02:29:25,157 --> 02:29:26,784
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3266
02:29:26,867 --> 02:29:29,286
<i>There's nobody holding you back
from financial freedom.</i>

3267
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:32,289
And there's nobody stopping you
from making millions.

3268
02:29:32,373 --> 02:29:33,624
Don't just sit at home,

3269
02:29:33,707 --> 02:29:36,335
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3270
02:29:39,088 --> 02:29:42,716
I changed all these people's lives
and I can change yours, too!

3271
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,051
So come to my seminar!

3272
02:29:44,135 --> 02:29:45,511
The life of your dreams is only...

3273
02:29:45,594 --> 02:29:47,304
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3274
02:29:47,388 --> 02:29:48,472
You're under arrest!

3275
02:29:48,556 --> 02:29:50,141
You gotta be joking!

3276
02:29:51,392 --> 02:29:52,643
You're kidding me.

3277
02:29:52,726 --> 02:29:54,311
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3278
02:29:54,395 --> 02:29:55,646
Turn that camera off.

3279
02:29:55,729 --> 02:29:57,731
I'm fucking shooting
a fucking infomercial here,

3280
02:29:57,815 --> 02:29:59,191
you fucking cocksucker!

3281
02:29:59,275 --> 02:30:00,985
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3282
02:30:01,068 --> 02:30:02,820
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3283
02:30:02,903 --> 02:30:03,988
Go fuck yourself!

3284
02:30:04,071 --> 02:30:06,448
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3285
02:30:06,532 --> 02:30:09,493
Hey, Jordan,
let me give you a little legal advice.

3286
02:30:09,577 --> 02:30:10,995
Shut the fuck up!

3287
02:30:11,078 --> 02:30:12,621
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3288
02:30:12,705 --> 02:30:15,249
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3289
02:30:17,084 --> 02:30:18,502
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3290
02:30:18,586 --> 02:30:21,172
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3291
02:30:21,255 --> 02:30:24,008
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3292
02:30:24,091 --> 02:30:26,302
<i>Rugrat goes
and gets busted down in Miami.</i>

3293
02:30:26,385 --> 02:30:27,636
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3294
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,388
<i>And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3295
02:30:29,471 --> 02:30:30,514
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3296
02:30:30,598 --> 02:30:32,850
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3297
02:30:32,933 --> 02:30:34,685
<i>I mean, what are the fucking odds?</i>

3298
02:30:34,768 --> 02:30:37,396
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3299
02:30:37,479 --> 02:30:41,275
<i>and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.</i>

3300
02:30:41,358 --> 02:30:42,735
I know.

3301
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:44,236
I'm so sorry.

3302
02:30:46,447 --> 02:30:47,656
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3303
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:50,868
<i>was that he got busted
for shit that had nothing to do with me.</i>

3304
02:30:50,951 --> 02:30:52,536
<i>It had nothing to fucking do with me.</i>

3305
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,580
<i>Something about laundering drug money</i>

3306
02:30:54,663 --> 02:30:57,750
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3307
02:30:57,833 --> 02:30:59,960
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

3308
02:31:00,044 --> 02:31:01,378
<i>Benihana.</i>

3309
02:31:01,462 --> 02:31:03,130
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3310
02:31:03,589 --> 02:31:05,341
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3311
02:31:05,424 --> 02:31:06,383
<i>Why?</i>

3312
02:31:06,467 --> 02:31:07,843
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3313
02:31:07,927 --> 02:31:09,386
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3314
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:12,056
<i>as to choose
a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3315
02:31:12,139 --> 02:31:13,390
<i>to take me down?</i>

3316
02:31:15,809 --> 02:31:18,270
<i>Long story short. Saurel rats me out.</i>

3317
02:31:18,354 --> 02:31:21,482
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3318
02:31:21,565 --> 02:31:25,653
<i>who, it turns out, he'd been fucking
every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

3319
02:31:27,655 --> 02:31:30,157
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3320
02:31:32,368 --> 02:31:34,161
All right!

3321
02:31:34,245 --> 02:31:37,748
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit securities fraud.</i>

3322
02:31:37,831 --> 02:31:40,042
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3323
02:31:40,125 --> 02:31:43,587
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3324
02:31:43,671 --> 02:31:45,923
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3325
02:31:46,006 --> 02:31:48,384
One count obstruction of justice.

3326
02:31:49,426 --> 02:31:51,637
Bail is set at $10 million.

3327
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,445
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3328
02:32:09,238 --> 02:32:11,490
Rocky. How you doing?

3329
02:32:12,783 --> 02:32:14,451
I hate that fucking dog.

3330
02:32:14,535 --> 02:32:16,870
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3331
02:32:16,954 --> 02:32:18,455
Starting to shit in the house again.

3332
02:32:18,539 --> 02:32:20,249
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3333
02:32:20,332 --> 02:32:21,625
Ah, fuck.

3334
02:32:21,709 --> 02:32:23,335
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3335
02:32:23,419 --> 02:32:24,628
Good to see you.

3336
02:32:24,712 --> 02:32:27,214
Sit down. Oh, man.

3337
02:32:29,091 --> 02:32:30,384
How you doing, brother?

3338
02:32:31,218 --> 02:32:32,720
You know.

3339
02:32:32,803 --> 02:32:34,471
Shitty, pal.

3340
02:32:34,555 --> 02:32:36,682
But I'm hanging in there.

3341
02:32:38,017 --> 02:32:40,519
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3342
02:32:40,602 --> 02:32:42,980
Can't leave the house, you know?

3343
02:32:43,063 --> 02:32:45,649
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3344
02:32:46,233 --> 02:32:47,776
Fucking Rugrat.

3345
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,653
That wig-wearing faggot.

3346
02:32:49,737 --> 02:32:51,864
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3347
02:32:51,947 --> 02:32:54,533
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3348
02:32:54,616 --> 02:32:56,910
Irresponsible little prick.

3349
02:32:57,036 --> 02:32:58,078
I'll tell you one thing.

3350
02:33:00,456 --> 02:33:02,958
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3351
02:33:03,834 --> 02:33:06,003
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3352
02:33:07,421 --> 02:33:08,964
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3353
02:33:09,757 --> 02:33:11,050
That's her in the house there.

3354
02:33:11,133 --> 02:33:13,093
You could say hi,
but she probably won't wave back.

3355
02:33:13,344 --> 02:33:14,970
Naomi, sweetheart!

3356
02:33:18,432 --> 02:33:19,683
What's up her ass?

3357
02:33:19,767 --> 02:33:21,310
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3358
02:33:21,393 --> 02:33:22,853
We probably have to mortgage the house

3359
02:33:22,936 --> 02:33:24,730
in order to make bail.

3360
02:33:24,813 --> 02:33:28,525
Probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3361
02:33:28,609 --> 02:33:31,070
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3362
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:33,030
What are you gonna do, right?

3363
02:33:33,822 --> 02:33:36,658
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3364
02:33:36,742 --> 02:33:37,826
How's morale?

3365
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:40,537
They all pissed off 'cause they have
to make money legally now?

3366
02:33:40,621 --> 02:33:42,081
Jordan.

3367
02:33:42,456 --> 02:33:44,875
I got the founding partners together.

3368
02:33:44,958 --> 02:33:47,378
I talked to them about everything.

3369
02:33:48,128 --> 02:33:49,129
And I got you.

3370
02:33:49,963 --> 02:33:51,548
What do you mean, you got me?

3371
02:33:52,716 --> 02:33:55,469
The house, money,
don't worry about it. I got you.

3372
02:34:01,475 --> 02:34:02,559
All right.

3373
02:34:02,643 --> 02:34:03,602
I love you, buddy.

3374
02:34:03,685 --> 02:34:05,604
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3375
02:34:05,687 --> 02:34:07,648
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3376
02:34:08,649 --> 02:34:09,775
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3377
02:34:09,858 --> 02:34:11,026
All right, enough, enough.

3378
02:34:13,112 --> 02:34:14,238
You want a beer, pal?

3379
02:34:14,321 --> 02:34:15,572
What are you drinking?

3380
02:34:15,656 --> 02:34:17,741
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3381
02:34:17,825 --> 02:34:19,034
What's that?

3382
02:34:19,118 --> 02:34:22,121
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

3383
02:34:22,204 --> 02:34:24,498
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3384
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,291
But if you drink enough,

3385
02:34:26,375 --> 02:34:28,293
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3386
02:34:28,377 --> 02:34:30,462
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3387
02:34:30,546 --> 02:34:31,588
I'm not a scientist.

3388
02:34:31,672 --> 02:34:32,840
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3389
02:34:32,923 --> 02:34:34,508
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3390
02:34:34,633 --> 02:34:36,760
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3391
02:34:36,844 --> 02:34:38,053
I don't drink anymore.

3392
02:34:38,137 --> 02:34:40,597
Oh, you wanna go inside
and blow some lines of baking powder?

3393
02:34:40,681 --> 02:34:41,849
Or baking soda...

3394
02:34:42,641 --> 02:34:44,935
Can't imagine ever not enjoying
getting fucked up.

3395
02:34:45,018 --> 02:34:46,437
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3396
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:48,063
How's being sober?

3397
02:34:48,147 --> 02:34:49,982
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3398
02:34:50,065 --> 02:34:52,484
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3399
02:34:53,026 --> 02:34:55,571
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3400
02:34:55,654 --> 02:34:57,114
unless circumstances dictate,

3401
02:34:57,197 --> 02:34:59,158
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3402
02:34:59,241 --> 02:35:00,659
and the term is "Grenada."

3403
02:35:00,742 --> 02:35:02,286
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3404
02:35:02,369 --> 02:35:03,412
No. No, I haven't.

3405
02:35:03,537 --> 02:35:07,040
Grenada's very interesting because
it is a small island nation

3406
02:35:07,124 --> 02:35:10,669
that was invaded by
the United States of America in 1983.

3407
02:35:10,752 --> 02:35:12,838
It's about 90,000 people.

3408
02:35:12,921 --> 02:35:15,174
And essentially, it means

3409
02:35:15,924 --> 02:35:17,926
this case is unloseable.

3410
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:19,094
Okay?

3411
02:35:19,178 --> 02:35:20,762
So, you know, we can come in,

3412
02:35:20,846 --> 02:35:22,681
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3413
02:35:22,764 --> 02:35:23,932
Nobody gives a fuck.

3414
02:35:24,016 --> 02:35:25,559
I'm gonna win.

3415
02:35:25,726 --> 02:35:27,102
You, sir,

3416
02:35:28,645 --> 02:35:30,397
are what's known

3417
02:35:31,398 --> 02:35:32,608
as a Grenada.

3418
02:35:35,736 --> 02:35:38,071
You're looking at real prison time.

3419
02:35:39,239 --> 02:35:41,575
Money laundering
can get you as much as 20 years.

3420
02:35:42,576 --> 02:35:45,245
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3421
02:35:45,329 --> 02:35:46,997
shoving cash in your mattress.

3422
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,123
Is that right?

3423
02:35:48,999 --> 02:35:51,418
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3424
02:35:52,127 --> 02:35:55,964
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3425
02:35:56,048 --> 02:35:57,674
that's not our ambition here.

3426
02:35:59,092 --> 02:36:01,637
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3427
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,848
We think they need
to see their day in court as well.

3428
02:36:07,434 --> 02:36:09,478
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3429
02:36:09,561 --> 02:36:12,231
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3430
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,193
Full cooperation. He provides us
with a comprehensive list

3431
02:36:16,276 --> 02:36:18,654
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3432
02:36:18,737 --> 02:36:20,697
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3433
02:36:20,781 --> 02:36:22,032
Wait...

3434
02:36:22,115 --> 02:36:23,867
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3435
02:36:23,951 --> 02:36:25,202
A wire.

3436
02:36:25,285 --> 02:36:26,662
What does that mean?

3437
02:36:26,745 --> 02:36:28,580
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3438
02:36:28,664 --> 02:36:29,957
No, I want you to cooperate.

3439
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:31,959
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3440
02:36:32,042 --> 02:36:35,879
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3441
02:36:39,967 --> 02:36:41,802
How was Cristy's party?

3442
02:36:41,885 --> 02:36:42,970
Fine.

3443
02:36:43,053 --> 02:36:44,429
Good.

3444
02:36:45,597 --> 02:36:48,058
Babe, I spoke
to the lawyers again today.

3445
02:36:48,141 --> 02:36:50,811
I have some really, really great news.

3446
02:36:52,646 --> 02:36:55,190
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3447
02:36:56,149 --> 02:36:57,818
I know that already.

3448
02:36:57,901 --> 02:36:59,403
Right. Exactly.

3449
02:36:59,486 --> 02:37:02,698
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3450
02:37:03,657 --> 02:37:05,867
It turns out, all the FBI really

3451
02:37:06,535 --> 02:37:10,205
wants from me is to cooperate.

3452
02:37:10,455 --> 02:37:11,665
You know?

3453
02:37:11,748 --> 02:37:14,751
Turns out I have so much information
about the stock market and Wall Street,

3454
02:37:14,835 --> 02:37:16,628
I could save the government
years of heartache,

3455
02:37:16,712 --> 02:37:19,339
not to mention countless dollars.

3456
02:37:20,841 --> 02:37:23,176
But it gets even better, babe.

3457
02:37:23,635 --> 02:37:26,179
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3458
02:37:26,555 --> 02:37:29,391
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3459
02:37:29,474 --> 02:37:30,934
in which case, you know,

3460
02:37:31,018 --> 02:37:34,062
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3461
02:37:34,146 --> 02:37:35,772
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3462
02:37:35,856 --> 02:37:37,649
wouldn't be due
till after I serve my term,

3463
02:37:37,733 --> 02:37:40,027
so we'd still have plenty
of money left over, you know?

3464
02:37:42,696 --> 02:37:45,115
The only thing that
of course bummed me out a little bit

3465
02:37:45,198 --> 02:37:50,245
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends.

3466
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:53,540
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3467
02:37:53,624 --> 02:37:55,584
Right. Right. Exactly.

3468
02:37:55,667 --> 02:37:57,252
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3469
02:37:57,336 --> 02:37:59,004
Because they said eventually...

3470
02:37:59,087 --> 02:38:01,965
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3471
02:38:02,049 --> 02:38:04,843
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3472
02:38:04,926 --> 02:38:07,054
Well, that's good news. Right?

3473
02:38:07,179 --> 02:38:08,889
Yeah, yeah.

3474
02:38:08,972 --> 02:38:10,682
I'm really happy for you.

3475
02:38:12,059 --> 02:38:15,312
What do you mean,
happy for me, sweetheart?

3476
02:38:16,229 --> 02:38:18,815
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3477
02:38:18,899 --> 02:38:20,859
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3478
02:38:22,944 --> 02:38:24,571
Come here, baby.

3479
02:38:25,072 --> 02:38:26,615
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3480
02:38:26,698 --> 02:38:27,699
Jordan...

3481
02:38:27,783 --> 02:38:28,992
Oh, come on, baby.

3482
02:38:29,076 --> 02:38:31,286
I haven't made love to you
in so long. Please.

3483
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:33,789
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3484
02:38:33,872 --> 02:38:35,290
No! Jordan, stop it!

3485
02:38:37,042 --> 02:38:39,252
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3486
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:45,008
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3487
02:38:45,592 --> 02:38:48,136
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3488
02:38:49,012 --> 02:38:50,931
You know how much I love you, right?

3489
02:38:51,431 --> 02:38:53,600
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3490
02:38:58,855 --> 02:39:00,899
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3491
02:39:02,651 --> 02:39:04,361
You wanna fuck me?

3492
02:39:05,362 --> 02:39:06,488
Good.

3493
02:39:06,571 --> 02:39:07,906
Go ahead.

3494
02:39:08,407 --> 02:39:10,325
Go ahead and fuck me.

3495
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:13,829
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3496
02:39:13,954 --> 02:39:16,623
I want you to fuck me like
it's the last fucking time.

3497
02:39:16,707 --> 02:39:18,041
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3498
02:39:18,125 --> 02:39:19,084
Please hold still.

3499
02:39:19,167 --> 02:39:20,711
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3500
02:39:20,794 --> 02:39:22,129
Come on, babe.

3501
02:39:22,212 --> 02:39:23,714
Come for me, baby.

3502
02:39:23,797 --> 02:39:25,006
I want you to come for me

3503
02:39:25,090 --> 02:39:26,550
like it's the last fucking time.

3504
02:39:26,633 --> 02:39:28,093
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3505
02:39:28,176 --> 02:39:30,762
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3506
02:39:30,846 --> 02:39:31,972
Come on, baby.

3507
02:39:32,055 --> 02:39:33,390
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3508
02:39:33,473 --> 02:39:35,392
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3509
02:39:35,475 --> 02:39:36,643
Yeah.

3510
02:39:37,477 --> 02:39:39,438
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3511
02:39:39,521 --> 02:39:41,857
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3512
02:39:43,692 --> 02:39:45,402
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3513
02:39:45,485 --> 02:39:47,988
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3514
02:39:49,322 --> 02:39:51,658
Oh, God.

3515
02:39:52,325 --> 02:39:53,744
Oh, God.

3516
02:39:53,827 --> 02:39:55,078
Jesus.

3517
02:39:58,707 --> 02:40:00,041
On, baby.

3518
02:40:00,125 --> 02:40:02,627
That was so fucking great!

3519
02:40:02,711 --> 02:40:04,004
Oh, God!

3520
02:40:06,339 --> 02:40:08,300
That was the last time.

3521
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:10,761
What do you mean, baby?

3522
02:40:10,844 --> 02:40:13,805
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3523
02:40:14,806 --> 02:40:16,850
What are you talking about?

3524
02:40:18,852 --> 02:40:20,520
I want a divorce.

3525
02:40:22,105 --> 02:40:24,107
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3526
02:40:24,191 --> 02:40:26,234
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3527
02:40:26,318 --> 02:40:28,195
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3528
02:40:28,528 --> 02:40:29,780
You just made love to me.

3529
02:40:29,863 --> 02:40:30,947
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3530
02:40:31,031 --> 02:40:33,366
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3531
02:40:34,659 --> 02:40:36,620
Oh, you don't love me?

3532
02:40:37,037 --> 02:40:38,622
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3533
02:40:38,705 --> 02:40:40,957
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3534
02:40:41,041 --> 02:40:42,876
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3535
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:44,920
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3536
02:40:45,003 --> 02:40:46,713
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3537
02:40:46,797 --> 02:40:48,548
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3538
02:40:48,882 --> 02:40:51,134
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3539
02:40:51,218 --> 02:40:52,469
You married me!

3540
02:40:52,552 --> 02:40:54,054
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

3541
02:40:54,137 --> 02:40:55,806
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3542
02:40:55,889 --> 02:40:58,058
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3543
02:40:58,141 --> 02:41:01,686
If you agree to the divorce right now,
I will allow visitation.

3544
02:41:01,812 --> 02:41:03,647
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3545
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:07,901
It'll save us both a lot of money
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3546
02:41:09,444 --> 02:41:12,656
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart.
You hear me?

3547
02:41:12,739 --> 02:41:14,157
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3548
02:41:14,241 --> 02:41:15,492
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3549
02:41:15,575 --> 02:41:16,660
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3550
02:41:16,743 --> 02:41:17,828
I got news for you.

3551
02:41:17,911 --> 02:41:21,331
You're not fucking taking my children,
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3552
02:41:21,873 --> 02:41:23,834
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3553
02:41:23,917 --> 02:41:26,086
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3554
02:41:26,169 --> 02:41:27,546
You hear me? Fuck you!

3555
02:41:27,754 --> 02:41:30,507
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3556
02:41:39,099 --> 02:41:40,892
Fucking bitch!

3557
02:41:43,353 --> 02:41:44,729
Fucking whore!

3558
02:41:49,109 --> 02:41:51,778
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3559
02:42:00,954 --> 02:42:03,707
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3560
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,958
You're sick!

3561
02:42:05,041 --> 02:42:06,209
You're a sick man!

3562
02:42:06,293 --> 02:42:08,336
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3563
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:10,881
You think I would let my kids near you?

3564
02:42:10,964 --> 02:42:12,132
Look at yourself!

3565
02:42:12,215 --> 02:42:13,717
You know what my lawyer said?

3566
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:17,262
My lawyer said that you're going
to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3567
02:42:17,345 --> 02:42:20,599
Twenty fucking years!
You're never gonna see the kids again!

3568
02:42:20,682 --> 02:42:21,892
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3569
02:42:21,975 --> 02:42:23,727
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3570
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:25,979
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3571
02:42:26,062 --> 02:42:27,606
Don't you fucking touch them!

3572
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:30,734
Don't you fucking touch me!

3573
02:42:32,444 --> 02:42:35,697
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3574
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,741
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3575
02:42:40,493 --> 02:42:42,746
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3576
02:42:42,829 --> 02:42:45,582
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3577
02:42:48,251 --> 02:42:49,502
It's all right, baby.

3578
02:42:49,586 --> 02:42:52,297
You and Daddy are gonna go
on a little trip together, okay?

3579
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:53,924
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3580
02:42:54,007 --> 02:42:55,091
Violet!

3581
02:42:55,175 --> 02:42:57,385
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3582
02:42:57,469 --> 02:42:59,095
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3583
02:42:59,179 --> 02:43:01,973
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3584
02:43:02,057 --> 02:43:03,391
There you go. Get your legs in.

3585
02:43:03,475 --> 02:43:05,101
I'm taking her with me!

3586
02:43:05,185 --> 02:43:07,812
I told you I'm taking her with me,
you fucking bitch!

3587
02:43:07,896 --> 02:43:10,607
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3588
02:43:11,399 --> 02:43:13,485
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3589
02:43:13,902 --> 02:43:15,403
No! No!

3590
02:43:16,029 --> 02:43:17,405
Get the hell out of here!

3591
02:43:17,489 --> 02:43:19,616
Leave that baby alone!

3592
02:43:19,699 --> 02:43:21,868
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3593
02:43:21,952 --> 02:43:23,078
Mommy!

3594
02:43:23,203 --> 02:43:25,372
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3595
02:43:26,289 --> 02:43:27,415
Mommy!

3596
02:43:30,460 --> 02:43:32,087
No!

3597
02:43:39,386 --> 02:43:42,138
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3598
02:43:42,222 --> 02:43:43,515
Get the baby!

3599
02:43:43,598 --> 02:43:45,725
Naomi, get the baby!

3600
02:43:46,476 --> 02:43:48,144
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3601
02:43:48,228 --> 02:43:49,479
It's gonna be okay.

3602
02:43:49,562 --> 02:43:51,564
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3603
02:43:52,565 --> 02:43:54,359
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3604
02:43:54,442 --> 02:43:56,027
She all right?

3605
02:43:56,111 --> 02:43:57,404
Is she all right?

3606
02:43:58,154 --> 02:43:59,739
What's the matter with you?

3607
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,324
Is she all right?

3608
02:44:08,707 --> 02:44:10,083
<i>Paragraph one.</i>

3609
02:44:10,166 --> 02:44:11,668
<i>The defendant shall plead guilty</i>

3610
02:44:11,751 --> 02:44:15,171
<i>to all counts of the indictment
currently pending against him</i>

3611
02:44:15,255 --> 02:44:19,092
<i>in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York.</i>

3612
02:44:19,592 --> 02:44:20,677
<i>Paragraph two.</i>

3613
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:21,886
Talk normally.

3614
02:44:21,970 --> 02:44:25,181
<i>The defendant shall participate
in undercover activities...</i>

3615
02:44:25,265 --> 02:44:26,391
Breathe normally.

3616
02:44:26,474 --> 02:44:30,020
<i>Including wearing a recording device,
also known as a wire...</i>

3617
02:44:30,103 --> 02:44:32,272
After five minutes,
you'll forget you even have it on.

3618
02:44:32,355 --> 02:44:33,481
<i>In conjunction with the investigation...</i>

3619
02:44:33,565 --> 02:44:35,108
Fucking brutal.

3620
02:44:35,233 --> 02:44:36,484
Quit your bitching.

3621
02:44:36,568 --> 02:44:38,403
Paragraph four.
The defendant must not commit,

3622
02:44:38,486 --> 02:44:40,655
or attempt to commit,
any further crimes.

3623
02:44:40,739 --> 02:44:44,200
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3624
02:44:44,284 --> 02:44:45,660
Thank you.

3625
02:44:48,621 --> 02:44:49,789
Just here?

3626
02:44:49,873 --> 02:44:51,416
That'd be good.

3627
02:44:53,126 --> 02:44:54,252
Thank you.

3628
02:44:54,335 --> 02:44:55,962
<i>It wasn't even a choice.</i>

3629
02:44:57,005 --> 02:45:00,008
<i>For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.</i>

3630
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:03,219
<i>Friends, enemies, business associates.</i>

3631
02:45:03,303 --> 02:45:07,390
<i>Anybody who'd ever known me
or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

3632
02:45:12,937 --> 02:45:15,231
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3633
02:45:17,025 --> 02:45:19,819
<i>The first name on the list was Donnie.</i>

3634
02:45:22,197 --> 02:45:25,325
Jordan, do you know how good it is
to have you back in this office?

3635
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:27,744
It's not the same when you're gone.

3636
02:45:27,827 --> 02:45:29,579
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3637
02:45:29,662 --> 02:45:31,081
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3638
02:45:31,164 --> 02:45:32,332
I can't...

3639
02:45:32,415 --> 02:45:34,250
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3640
02:45:34,334 --> 02:45:36,211
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3641
02:45:36,294 --> 02:45:37,962
I can't even say his name.

3642
02:45:38,046 --> 02:45:39,589
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3643
02:45:39,672 --> 02:45:42,050
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3644
02:45:43,343 --> 02:45:46,262
He ever get back to you about that...

3645
02:45:47,013 --> 02:45:48,765
About that account?

3646
02:45:54,604 --> 02:45:55,647
You remember.

3647
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:57,732
It was like four or five mil,
something like that, right?

3648
02:45:57,816 --> 02:46:00,944
He was supposed
to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3649
02:46:05,365 --> 02:46:06,825
Actually, I was...

3650
02:46:06,908 --> 02:46:08,284
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3651
02:46:08,368 --> 02:46:09,869
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3652
02:46:09,953 --> 02:46:11,955
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3653
02:46:12,622 --> 02:46:16,626
Well, if he calls you,
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3654
02:46:18,461 --> 02:46:20,130
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3655
02:46:20,213 --> 02:46:22,298
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3656
02:46:25,718 --> 02:46:28,221
You gonna eat
that last piece of yellowtail, bud?

3657
02:46:29,264 --> 02:46:31,015
No, it's all yours.

3658
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:33,184
Can I get this?

3659
02:46:35,687 --> 02:46:37,397
So, what else is...

3660
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:42,152
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3661
02:46:42,235 --> 02:46:43,653
You know how it is.

3662
02:46:43,736 --> 02:46:45,822
She hates my fucking guts.

3663
02:46:47,574 --> 02:46:49,242
How's Hildy? Good?

3664
02:46:50,076 --> 02:46:53,663
She's still alive,
so my life is fucked, you know?

3665
02:46:53,746 --> 02:46:54,914
Yeah.

3666
02:47:01,754 --> 02:47:03,256
Mr. Jordan.

3667
02:47:04,924 --> 02:47:07,093
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3668
02:47:07,468 --> 02:47:08,511
What?

3669
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:10,763
You've got a visitor.

3670
02:47:26,279 --> 02:47:28,281
I need you to get dressed.

3671
02:47:28,364 --> 02:47:30,575
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3672
02:47:35,622 --> 02:47:37,415
You're going to jail.

3673
02:47:49,344 --> 02:47:50,553
All right.

3674
02:47:50,637 --> 02:47:52,222
I'll get some clothes on.

3675
02:47:52,305 --> 02:47:54,641
We'll give you a hand with that.

3676
02:48:03,233 --> 02:48:04,317
Okay.

3677
02:48:16,537 --> 02:48:17,789
FBI!

3678
02:48:18,206 --> 02:48:21,793
Everybody sit down. Put your hands
where they can be seen, and shut up!

3679
02:48:21,876 --> 02:48:23,586
Don't you fucking touch me.

3680
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:25,797
Get your fucking hands off me!

3681
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,632
Don't get out of your seats!

3682
02:48:40,853 --> 02:48:42,480
It's fucking Chanel!

3683
02:48:55,118 --> 02:48:57,203
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3684
02:48:57,370 --> 02:48:58,871
<i>And in return,</i>

3685
02:48:58,955 --> 02:49:03,334
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

3686
02:49:05,211 --> 02:49:07,588
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

3687
02:49:08,381 --> 02:49:10,967
<i>"The chickens had come home to roost."</i>

3688
02:49:12,385 --> 02:49:14,595
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3689
02:49:18,182 --> 02:49:19,475
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3690
02:49:19,559 --> 02:49:21,561
that Mr. Belfort
has distinguished himself

3691
02:49:21,644 --> 02:49:23,730
in terms of his cooperation.

3692
02:49:23,813 --> 02:49:25,857
Mr. Belfort has helped
the government win convictions

3693
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:28,484
of over two dozen serious offenders

3694
02:49:29,736 --> 02:49:31,654
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3695
02:49:31,738 --> 02:49:35,158
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3696
02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:41,080
The sentence of the court shall be
36 months in federal prison.

3697
02:49:42,915 --> 02:49:45,043
Please remand the defendant.

3698
02:49:47,253 --> 02:49:48,963
I'm sorry.

3699
02:49:51,883 --> 02:49:52,925
That's okay.

3700
02:50:41,307 --> 02:50:43,726
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3701
02:50:43,810 --> 02:50:45,645
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3702
02:50:45,728 --> 02:50:47,897
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3703
02:50:48,689 --> 02:50:50,066
Belfort, on your feet.

3704
02:50:50,149 --> 02:50:52,443
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3705
02:50:52,652 --> 02:50:55,279
<i>You see, for a brief fleeting moment,</i>

3706
02:50:55,988 --> 02:50:58,032
<i>I'd forgotten I was rich.</i>

3707
02:50:59,033 --> 02:51:02,495
<i>And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.</i>

3708
02:51:04,997 --> 02:51:07,708
<i>Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?</i>

3709
02:51:07,792 --> 02:51:10,670
<i>So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.</i>

3710
02:51:10,753 --> 02:51:14,215
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes, gangsters.</i>

3711
02:51:14,298 --> 02:51:16,092
<i>I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.</i>

3712
02:51:16,175 --> 02:51:18,469
<i>But this guy, my good friend,</i>

3713
02:51:18,553 --> 02:51:21,305
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i>

3714
02:51:21,389 --> 02:51:24,183
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3715
02:51:24,725 --> 02:51:26,436
So I want you right now

3716
02:51:26,519 --> 02:51:29,647
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3717
02:51:29,730 --> 02:51:34,110
for my good friend
and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3718
02:51:34,193 --> 02:51:36,446
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3719
02:51:47,415 --> 02:51:48,708
Thank you.

3720
02:52:11,689 --> 02:52:13,399
Sell me this pen.

3721
02:52:17,987 --> 02:52:20,031
It's...

3722
02:52:20,323 --> 02:52:22,074
It's an amazing pen.

3723
02:52:22,408 --> 02:52:24,577
For professionals, it's a...

3724
02:52:27,705 --> 02:52:29,415
Sell me this pen.

3725
02:52:30,416 --> 02:52:31,626
Well, it's a nice pen.

3726
02:52:31,709 --> 02:52:33,002
You can use the pen

3727
02:52:33,085 --> 02:52:36,297
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3728
02:52:38,090 --> 02:52:41,427
Sell me this pen.

3729
02:52:43,429 --> 02:52:44,639
Well...

3730
02:52:45,014 --> 02:52:48,601
This pen works
and I personally love this pen...
