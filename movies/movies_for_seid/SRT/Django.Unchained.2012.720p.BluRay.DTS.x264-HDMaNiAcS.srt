1
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:21,624
Who's that stumbling around in the dark?

2
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,580
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

3
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,787
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

4
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,530
I mean you no harm.

5
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,362
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

6
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,889
Oh boy.

7
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,416
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

8
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:41,969
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

9
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,846
that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

10
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,074
Might that be you?

11
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,999
Who wants to know?

12
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,341
Well, I do.

13
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,980
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

14
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:54,907
What kinda doctor?

15
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,597
Dentist.

16
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,540
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

17
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,133
And did you purchase those men

18
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,515
at the Greenville slave auction?

19
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,353
So what?

20
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:04,471
So I wish to parley with you.

21
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:05,541
Speak English.

22
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,257
Oh sorry.

23
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

24
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,760
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

25
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,914
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

26
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,897
Hello, you poor devils!

27
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,037
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

28
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,565
of the Carrucan plantation?

29
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,799
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

30
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:30,803
Who said that?

31
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,369
What's your name?

32
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,853
Django.

33
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,335
Then you are exactly the one
I'm looking for.

34
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,195
Do you know
who the Brittle Brothers are?

35
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,666
Who are they?

36
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:40,828
Big John.

37
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:42,993
Ellis.

38
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:45,685
Roger.

39
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,165
Sometime they call him...

40
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:48,623
Lil Raj.

41
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,328
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

42
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

43
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:57,794
Tell me...

44
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:01,454
if you were to see any of these
three gentlemen again,

45
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,092
would you recognize them?
Hey.

46
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,665
Stop talking to him like that.

47
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:06,714
Like What?

48
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,245
Like that.

49
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:11,216
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,394
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,216
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,966
I'm simply a customer,

53
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,310
trying to conduct a transaction.

54
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,219
I don't care.

55
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,984
No sale. Now, off with you.

56
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,154
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

57
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,920
Move it.

58
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:28,919
My good man,

59
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:32,661
did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

60
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:36,056
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

61
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,431
Last chance, fancy pants.

62
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,504
Oh, very well.

63
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,759
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

64
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,844
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

65
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

66
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,430
You goddamn son of a bitch!

67
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:25,089
You shot Roscoe!
Well...

68
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,161
And you killed Ace!

69
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,305
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

70
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

71
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,141
five witnesses,

72
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,350
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:38,357
Damn leg's busted!

74
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:39,481
No doubt.

75
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:42,597
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

76
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,405
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

77
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,689
God-fucking-damn it!

78
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:52,662
As I was saying...

79
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,661
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers,

80
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,125
again you could recognize them?

81
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,489
Yeah.

82
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:00,924
Sold American!

83
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,177
So, Mr. Speck?

84
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,579
Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

85
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,595
That iron is nasty business.

86
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:19,910
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

87
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,347
Thank you.

88
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,121
Django?

89
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,579
Get up on that horse.

90
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:27,734
Also, if I were you,

91
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:31,896
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

92
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:46,973
Nigger!

93
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,683
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

94
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,035
Goddamn it!

95
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,098
One hundred...

96
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,593
ten...

97
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:12,320
20...

98
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,448
and five...

99
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,102
for young Django here.

100
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,647
And since he won't be needing it anymore,

101
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,835
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

102
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:23,720
Also,

103
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,002
Mr. Speck,

104
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,545
I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.

105
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:28,635
Do you have one?

106
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:31,860
You go to hell, dentist.

107
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:33,952
I thought not.

108
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,925
No worries.

109
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,886
I come prepared.

110
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,416
Thank you.

111
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,308
This will serve nicely,

112
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,779
as a bill of sale.

113
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:08,434
Now, as to you poor devils.

114
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,850
So, as I see it,

115
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:14,033
when it comes to the subject
of what to do next,

116
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,908
you gentlemen have...

117
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,038
two choices.

118
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:18,082
One.

119
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,808
Once I'm gone,

120
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,786
you could lift that beast
off the remaining Speck,

121
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:24,477
then carry him to the nearest town.

122
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:27,937
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

123
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:29,340
Or two.

124
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,327
You could unshackle yourselves,

125
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,070
take that rifle,

126
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,572
put a bullet in his head,

127
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,090
bury the two of them deep,

128
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:40,493
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

129
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:42,709
Choice is yours.

130
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:47,474
And on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

131
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,973
the North Star is that one.

132
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:52,883
Tada.

133
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,476
Now wait a minute, fellas.

134
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:13,305
Let's talk about this!

135
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,907
You got to be reasonable
in a situation like this!

136
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doing my job!

137
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:26,618
Blueberry,

138
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,104
didn't I give you my last apple?

139
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,699
Tell you what, boys.

140
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,533
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

141
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,263
I'll get you your freedom.

142
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,357
No. No, please...

143
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,222
Alright, now.

144
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,642
I'd like you to take two of these tonight,

145
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,485
and then in the morning...

146
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,558
That's a nigger on a horse.

147
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:00,935
What's everybody staring at?

148
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,481
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

149
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,861
Good morning, innkeeper!

150
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,776
Two beers for two weary travelers.

151
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:34,833
It's still a bit early.

152
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:37,141
We won't be open for another hour.

153
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:39,494
By then, we'll be serving breakfast.

154
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,906
What the hell you think you're doing, boy?

155
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,786
Get that nigger outta here!

156
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,075
Help! Help!

157
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,131
Innkeeper!

158
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,383
Remember,

159
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,350
get the sheriff, not the marshal.

160
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,357
Sheriff! Help!

161
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:01,681
Alas.

162
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

163
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,873
Sit down, my boy.

164
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,348
What kind of dentist are you?

165
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

166
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,192
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

167
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,503
bounty hunter.

168
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,882
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

169
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,413
No.

170
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:50,602
Well...

171
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,874
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

172
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,223
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

173
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,246
Hat.

174
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,372
Prost.

175
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:18,104
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

176
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,184
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

177
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:25,190
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

178
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,700
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

179
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,089
I show that corpse
to the authorities,

180
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,576
proving yes, indeed,
I truly have killed him,

181
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,197
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

182
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:36,465
So,

183
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,573
like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

184
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,924
What's a bounty?

185
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,132
It's like a reward.

186
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,904
You kill people?

187
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:50,399
And they give you a reward?

188
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,721
Certain people, yeah.

189
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:54,058
Bad people?

190
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,306
Badder they are, bigger the reward.

191
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:59,777
Which brings me to you.

192
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,993
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

193
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

194
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,297
On the other hand,

195
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,219
I need your help.

196
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,771
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

197
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,644
So, for the time being,

198
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,522
I'm gonna make this slavery
malarkey work to my benefit.

199
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,324
Still,

200
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,844
having said that,

201
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,118
I feel guilty.

202
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:27,740
So,

203
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:32,136
I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

204
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,964
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

205
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:47,422
However, at this endeavor,

206
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:49,295
I'm at a slight disadvantage,

207
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,877
insofar as I don't know
what they look like.

208
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,902
But you do.

209
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,452
Don't ya?

210
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,617
I know what they look like alright.

211
00:17:59,188 --> 00:17:59,853
Good.

212
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,982
So here's my agreement.

213
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,673
You travel with me until we find them.
Where we going?

214
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:09,139
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

215
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,423
but I don't know where.

216
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,059
That means we visit every plantation

217
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,764
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

218
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,314
And when we find them,

219
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,609
you point them out,

220
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,732
and I kill them.

221
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,300
You do that,

222
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,776
I agree to give you your freedom,

223
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,365
$25 per Brittle Brother.

224
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:29,678
That's $75.

225
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,242
And as if on cue,

226
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:33,697
here comes the sheriff.

227
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,090
Ok, boys.

228
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:44,484
Fun's over.

229
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:46,838
Come on out.

230
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,066
Alright folks,

231
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,176
calm down.

232
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,670
Go about your business.

233
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,998
These jokers will be gone soon.

234
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:02,987
Now,

235
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,675
why you all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

236
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,768
Scare all these nice people.

237
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,493
You ain't got nothing better to do,

238
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:18,282
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

239
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,684
and show your ass?

240
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,098
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

241
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,910
Now you can get the marshal.

242
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,227
Marshal!

243
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,261
Marshal!

244
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,648
Should we wait inside?

245
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:52,751
Can we just leave?

246
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,707
After you.

247
00:19:56,652 --> 00:20:00,168
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

248
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,236
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

249
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,326
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

250
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,114
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

251
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,976
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

252
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,753
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

253
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,223
You in the saloon!

254
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:21,528
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that building.

255
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,029
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

256
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,164
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

257
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,658
and I mean right now.

258
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
Is this the marshal I have
the pleasure of addressing?

259
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:37,230
Yes, it is.

260
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:39,865
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

261
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,023
Na wunderbar, marshal.

262
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

263
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,554
and just as you have instructed,

264
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,336
I am ready to step outside

265
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,162
with my hands,

266
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,362
raised above my head.

267
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,359
I trust as a representative

268
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,897
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,

269
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,911
I shan't be shot down

270
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,809
in the street by either
you or your deputies

271
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,648
before I've had my day in court.

272
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,680
You mean like you did our sheriff.

273
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

274
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

275
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,979
Do I have your word as a lawman,

276
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,300
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

277
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,553
Well,

278
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:32,495
much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

279
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:35,086
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

280
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,719
Fair enough, marshal.

281
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:38,962
Here we come.

282
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,005
They're a little tense out there.

283
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:46,632
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

284
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:49,609
Come ahead.

285
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,994
You unarmed?

286
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,479
Yes, indeed we are.

287
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,706
Marshal Tatum,

288
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:04,596
may I address you
and your deputies,

289
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,579
and apparently the entire town
of Daughtrey,

290
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:08,665
as to the incident that just occurred?

291
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,150
Go on.
Thank you.

292
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,138
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

293
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:18,183
Like yourself marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

294
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,378
The man lying dead in the dirt,

295
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,204
who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

296
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,218
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

297
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,469
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

298
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,603
with a price on his head of $200.

299
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,468
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

300
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,233
The hell you say!

301
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:42,260
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

302
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:44,097
But I'm willing to wager,

303
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,836
this man was elected sheriff

304
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,109
sometime in the past two years?

305
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

306
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,875
I know this, because three years ago,

307
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,888
he was rustling cattle from the B.C.

308
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:57,586
Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

309
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,053
Now this,

310
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:00,708
is a warrant,

311
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:03,331
made out by Circuit Court Judge,

312
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:07,085
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

313
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,262
You're encouraged to wire him.

314
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,204
He'll back up who I am,

315
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,071
and who your dear
departed sheriff was.

316
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,125
In other words marshal,

317
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,457
you owe me $200.

318
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,496
I'll be damned.

319
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:07,434
After this Brittle business is behind us,

320
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,148
you'll be a free man,

321
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:11,686
with a horse,

322
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,203
$75 in your back pocket...

323
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,291
What's your plan after that?

324
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:21,724
Find my wife,

325
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,256
and buy her freedom.

326
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,835
Django,

327
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:31,198
I had no idea you were a married man.

328
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

329
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,166
Me and my wife do.

330
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,165
Old Man Carrucan didn't,
that's why were.

331
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,271
We run off.

332
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,032
Django.

333
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,770
Django, Django.

334
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,783
You got sand, Django.

335
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:53,698
Boy's got sand.

336
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,806
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

337
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,671
I want you to burn a runaway R
right here on his cheek.

338
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,531
And the girl, too.

339
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,140
And I want you to take them
to the Greenville auction,

340
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:12,058
and sell them.

341
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,049
Both of them.

342
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,486
Separately.

343
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,471
And this one...

344
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,424
you will sell him cheap.

345
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,265
In Greenville...

346
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:34,953
there should be some
sort of a records office.

347
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,898
You know when she was sold...

348
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:47,959
you know where she came from,

349
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:50,420
and you know her name.

350
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:52,732
What is her name?

351
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,777
Broomhilda.

352
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,269
What?

353
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,133
Broom-hilda.

354
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,249
Broomhilda?

355
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,463
Were her owners German?

356
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:07,067
Yeah, how you know?

357
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:09,856
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

358
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,116
She was raised by a German mistress,

359
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,097
the Von Shafts.

360
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:13,747
She speak a little German, too.

361
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,963
Your wife?

362
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,565
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

363
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,607
to speak German with.

364
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,456
Well, let me get this straight.

365
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,133
Your slave wife speaks German,

366
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,922
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

367
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:29,849
Yep.

368
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:35,971
They call me Hilda.

369
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,776
When we gain access
to these plantations,

370
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,050
we'll be putting on an act.

371
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,940
You'll be playing a character.

372
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:12,997
No?

373
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,152
During the act,

374
00:27:22,262 --> 00:27:24,763
you can never break character.

375
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,292
Do you understand?

376
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,123
Yeah.

377
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,900
Don't break character.

378
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:36,661
And your character is that of The Valet.

379
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:38,837
What that is?

380
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:42,223
That's a fancy word for servant.

381
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:43,841
Valet?

382
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,117
And now Django,

383
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,752
you may choose your
character's costume.

384
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:54,459
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

385
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,732
But of course.

386
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:33,634
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

387
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:36,372
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

388
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:41,164
I said niggers on horses...
His name is Django.

389
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:42,503
He's a free man.

390
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:44,009
He can ride what he pleases.

391
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,439
Not on my property.

392
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:47,560
Not around my niggers, he can't.

393
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:49,835
My good sir,

394
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:52,932
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

395
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,753
Allow me to unring this bell.

396
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:58,161
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

397
00:28:58,224 --> 00:28:59,864
This is my valet, Django.

398
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,226
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

399
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:06,992
Mr. Bennett?

400
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,373
I've been led to believe,

401
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,905
that you are a gentleman,

402
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,289
and a businessman.

403
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:16,318
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

404
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,694
to parley with you now.

405
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,297
I wish to purchase one
of your nigger gals.

406
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,189
You and your Jimmie,

407
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,188
rode from Texas to Tennessee

408
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,686
to buy one of my nigger gals?

409
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:31,396
No appointment, no nothing?

410
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:33,402
Oh, I'm afraid so.

411
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,293
Well, what if I was to say I don't like you?

412
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,167
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

413
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:40,281
And I would not sell you a tinker's damn.

414
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:42,635
Now what you got to say about that?

415
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,154
Mr. Bennett.

416
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:51,428
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

417
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,661
I have,

418
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:56,282
5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

419
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:04,130
Well, come on inside and get
yourself something cool to drink.

420
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,697
Oh, maybe,

421
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,764
while we discuss business,
you could provide

422
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,656
one of your loveliest black creatures

423
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:26,097
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

424
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,470
Oh, well, absolutely.

425
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,606
Betina.

426
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:29,626
Yessir, Big Daddy?

427
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,861
What's your Jimmie's name again?

428
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,917
Django.
Django.

429
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,020
Betina sugar,

430
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,599
could you take Django there

431
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,513
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

432
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,255
As you please, Big Daddy.

433
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,238
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

434
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:43,978
I must remind you,

435
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,343
Django is a free man.

436
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,147
He cannot be treated like a slave.

437
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:49,033
He... within the bounds of good taste,

438
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:51,219
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

439
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:52,881
Understood, Schultz.

440
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:54,521
Betina, sugar?
Yes'm?

441
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,687
Django isn't a slave.

442
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:59,317
Django is a free man, you understand?

443
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:03,125
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

444
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,245
because he ain't like any of
the other niggers around here.

445
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:06,047
You got it?

446
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,727
You want I should treat him
like white folks?

447
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:09,815
No.

448
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:12,247
That's not what I said.

449
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:14,401
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

450
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,105
Yes,

451
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,850
I can see that.

452
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,167
What's the name of
that peckerwood boy

453
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,066
from town that works with the glass?

454
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,719
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

455
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,279
Oh, you mean Jerry.

456
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,894
That's the boy's name. Jerry!

457
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,472
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

458
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,670
Yes'm, Big Daddy.

459
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:34,310
Well, that's it, then.

460
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:37,303
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

461
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:47,490
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

462
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:50,225
Big Daddy call it that because it's big.

463
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,959
That there is the pantry.

464
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,790
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

465
00:31:57,737 --> 00:31:59,199
Po' little squirrels.

466
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,965
What you do for your massa?

467
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,978
Didn't you hear him
tell you I ain't no slave?

468
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:08,453
So you really free?
Yes, I's free.

469
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,584
You mean you wanna dress like that?

470
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:14,278
Betina, I need to ask you something.

471
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,388
What you want?

472
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,226
I'm looking for three white men.

473
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,717
Three brothers. Overseers.

474
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,694
Their name is Brittle.

475
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:20,513
You know them?

476
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,213
Brittle?
Yes, Brittle.

477
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,881
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,

478
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:25,235
Roger Brittle,

479
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,567
sometime called Lil Raj.

480
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,089
I don't know them.

481
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:30,542
They could be using a different name.

482
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,133
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

483
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,987
You mean the Shaffers?

484
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,049
Maybe.

485
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,437
Three brothers?

486
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,430
They here?

487
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:41,974
Could you point one of them
out to me?

488
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,813
Well, one's over in that field.

489
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,603
Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

490
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,124
She work in the house, John.

491
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:03,091
You could mess her skin up,

492
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,539
and you gonna mess her up,
and she ain't gonna be worth...

493
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,802
She ain't gonna be
worth a damn thing.

494
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,230
Now, your Bible say...

495
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:14,646
Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

496
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,066
You ready?

497
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,629
She didn't wanna run off with me.

498
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,509
If anybody should be getting
whupped now, it should be me.

499
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,747
It should be me, John.

500
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,656
Now, I been here long enough,

501
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,755
you know me, you know me
a long time, now.

502
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:35,261
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

503
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,092
She's a... she's a house slave.

504
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,076
She a house slave, she can't be...

505
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,732
On my knees.

506
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:02,780
I'm asking you this, please.
Ain't this what you want?

507
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:04,466
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

508
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:11,628
Is on my knees, John.

509
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:13,910
I like the way you beg, boy.

510
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:19,552
Is that who you was looking for?

511
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:22,615
Yep.

512
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,396
Where the other two at?

513
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,988
They by the stable,

514
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:29,283
punishing Little Jody for breaking eggs.

515
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,009
They whipping Little Jody?

516
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,400
Point me in that direction.

517
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,644
You go to that tree

518
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,428
and keep going that a way.

519
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,077
Go get that white man
I came here with.

520
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:47,451
Come on, now.
No, no, please!

521
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,122
Come on, girlie.
Please!

522
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,173
Come on.
Get you set up now.

523
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:54,177
And the Lord said, The fear of ye...

524
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,157
and the dread of ye...

525
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,930
shall be on every beast of the earth.

526
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,545
Come here now, woman!

527
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,498
You'd better give me that arm!
No please!

528
00:35:05,107 --> 00:35:05,959
No! No!

529
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,212
Ok, she's ready!

530
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:39,995
And after this,

531
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,725
we'll see if you break eggs again.

532
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:47,459
John Brittle!

533
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:10,031
You remember me?

534
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,387
I like the way you die, boy.

535
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,613
Goddamn son of a bitch!

536
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,066
Keep it funny!

537
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,238
Y'all wanna see something?

538
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:23,608
No!

539
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,945
Who were they?

540
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,196
That's Big John.

541
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:39,910
That's Lil Raj.

542
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,270
Where's Ellis?

543
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,180
He's the one high tailing it
across that field right now.

544
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,519
You sure that's him?
Yeah.

545
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,521
Positive?
I don't know.

546
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,106
You don't know if you're positive?
I don't know what positive mean.

547
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,557
It means you're sure.
Yes.

548
00:37:56,718 --> 00:37:58,744
Yes, what?
Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

549
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,519
I'm positive he dead.

550
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,757
Django!

551
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,292
Everybody calm down.

552
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:26,372
We mean no one else any harm.

553
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,099
Who are you two jokers?

554
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:30,296
I am Dr. King Schultz,

555
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:31,433
a legal representative

556
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,541
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

557
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:35,665
The man to my left,

558
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,268
is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

559
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:40,778
In my pocket is a warrant,

560
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,523
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

561
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,558
for the arrest and capture,

562
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,270
dead or alive,

563
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,450
of John Brittle,

564
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:54,458
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

565
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,198
They were going by the name Shaffer.

566
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:02,258
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name, was Brittle.

567
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,093
These are wanted men.

568
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:05,798
The law wants them for murder.

569
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,285
Now I reiterate,

570
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:10,419
the warrant states dead or alive,

571
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:13,708
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

572
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:17,127
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

573
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,389
I realize,

574
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:21,843
passions are high,

575
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:24,469
but I must warn you,

576
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,163
the penalty for taking deadly force

577
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,390
against an officer of the court in
the performance of his duty is...

578
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,017
you'll be hung by
the neck until you're dead.

579
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:41,006
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

580
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:44,122
Gve me.

581
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,137
Satisfied?

582
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,648
May I have that back, please?

583
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:17,793
Get off my land.

584
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,575
Posthaste.

585
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,517
Load up the bodies
as quickly as you can

586
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:24,813
and let's get outta here.

587
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:51,775
Yeah,

588
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,072
that's them sons-a-bitches.

589
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,578
Come on, men!

590
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:39,607
We're coming for you, nigger!

591
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:52,455
Now, unless they start shooting first,

592
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,571
nobody shoot them.

593
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:57,488
That's way too simple for these jokers.

594
00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:00,820
We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.

595
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:05,231
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

596
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,618
Damn.

597
00:42:12,414 --> 00:42:14,704
I can't see fucking shit outta this thing.

598
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,161
We ready or what?

599
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:19,705
Hold on,
I'm fucking with my eyeholes.

600
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:22,249
Oh shit.

601
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:24,734
I just made it worse.

602
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,935
Who made this goddamn shit?

603
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:28,101
Willard's wife.

604
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:29,965
Well, make your own goddamn masks!

605
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:30,792
Look,

606
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:33,771
nobody's saying they don't
appreciate what Jenny did.

607
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:36,359
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

608
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,555
I coulda cut it better than this!

609
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:39,854
What about you, Robert?

610
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:40,910
Can you see?

611
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,645
Not too good.

612
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:43,595
I mean,

613
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,275
if I don't move my head
I can see you pretty good,

614
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:47,235
more or less.

615
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,599
But when I start riding,
the bag's moving all over,

616
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,819
and I'm riding blind.

617
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,105
Shit.
Yeah.

618
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,222
I just made mine worse.

619
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,314
Oh, God.

620
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,953
Anybody bring any extra bags?

621
00:42:59,017 --> 00:42:59,741
No!

622
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,081
Nobody brought an extra bag.

623
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:04,015
I'm just asking.

624
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,999
Do we have to wear them when we ride?

625
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:07,428
Oh, well, shitfire!

626
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,629
If you don't wear them as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

627
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,474
Well, I can't see in this fucking thing!

628
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,626
I can't breathe in this fucking thing
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

629
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,736
Well, fuck all you all! I'm going home!

630
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,256
Now, I watched my wife work all day
getting 30 bags together

631
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:24,295
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

632
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,809
and all I can hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize!

633
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:29,256
From now on,

634
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,443
don't ask me or mine for nothing!

635
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:33,627
Now look,

636
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,777
let's not forget why we're here.

637
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,490
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

638
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:40,462
And we got to make
a lesson out of him.

639
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,911
Ok, I'm confused.

640
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,810
Are the bags on or off?

641
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,889
I think,

642
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:47,536
we all think,

643
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,568
the bag was a nice idea.

644
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:50,462
Yeah.

645
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,534
But, not pointing any fingers,

646
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:54,717
they coulda been done better.

647
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:57,200
So, how about...

648
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:59,080
no bags this time,

649
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,859
but next time,

650
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:02,410
we do the bags right,

651
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:03,798
and then we go,

652
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:04,725
full regalia.

653
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:07,180
I like that idea a lot.
You get my vote, Robert.

654
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:08,079
Wait a minute!

655
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:10,093
I didn't say no bags.

656
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,161
But nobody can see.

657
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:13,761
So?

658
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,696
So it'd be nice to see.

659
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,398
Goddamn it!

660
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:18,592
This is a raid!

661
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,891
I can't see, you can't see!

662
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:21,967
So what?

663
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,357
All that matters is can
the fucking horse see!

664
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:25,863
That's a raid!

665
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,657
Sons of bitches!

666
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,331
I can't see shit!

667
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,073
There he is!

668
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:35,649
Get that nigger out from
under that wagon!

669
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:38,260
And get that nigger lover
outta the wagon!

670
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,261
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

671
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,708
What?
They tricked us!

672
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
Well, where are they?

673
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,308
Auf Wiedersehen.

674
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,150
Bull's-eye.

675
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:57,216
Look at them run.

676
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:04,382
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

677
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,600
Goddamn it!

678
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,171
Goddamn it!

679
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:19,902
Would you care to?

680
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:28,806
Can't see shit outta this!

681
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:31,685
He's getting away.
I got him.

682
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,508
Big Daddy's getting away.

683
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,576
I got him.

684
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:52,991
Got him.

685
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,678
The kid's a natural.

686
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,927
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

687
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,352
Broomhilda is a German name.

688
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,455
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

689
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:23,014
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

690
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,026
Broomhilda,

691
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:26,990
is the name of a character

692
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,275
in the most,

693
00:46:28,276 --> 00:46:30,525
popular of all the German legends.

694
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,637
There's a story about Broomhilda?

695
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,439
Oh, yes, there is.

696
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:42,147
Do you know it?

697
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:44,318
Oh, every German knows that story.

698
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

699
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:54,668
Well,

700
00:46:56,035 --> 00:46:56,959
Broomhilda,

701
00:46:57,287 --> 00:46:58,160
was a...

702
00:46:58,785 --> 00:46:59,835
princess.

703
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,503
She was a daughter of Wotan,

704
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,733
god of all gods.

705
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:07,703
Anyway,

706
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,037
her father is really mad at her.

707
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,189
What she do?

708
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:13,991
I can't exactly remember.

709
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,236
She disobeys him in some way.

710
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,863
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

711
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

712
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,414
It's a German legend,

713
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,817
there is always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

714
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,114
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

715
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,253
And he surrounds her,

716
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:36,890
in a circle of hellfire.

717
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:39,719
And there,

718
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:42,662
Broomhilda shall remain.

719
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:45,549
Unless,

720
00:47:45,808 --> 00:47:49,339
a hero arises brave enough to save her.

721
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:51,886
Does a fella arise?

722
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,695
Yes Django,

723
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:55,234
as a matter of fact he does.

724
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,584
A fella named Siegfried.

725
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,571
Does Siegfried save her?

726
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:03,812
Quite spectacularly so.

727
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,843
He scales the mountain,

728
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,263
because he's not afraid of it.

729
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,418
He slays the dragon,

730
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,483
because he's not afraid of him.

731
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:16,578
And he walks through hellfire...

732
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,993
because Broomhilda's worth it.

733
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:26,925
I know how he feel.

734
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,183
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

735
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:37,899
Now,

736
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:39,284
look,

737
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,026
Django...

738
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:47,981
I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

739
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:52,561
but I can't let you go
to Greenville in a good conscience.

740
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,504
A slave auction town in Mississippi

741
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:58,229
isn't the place for you to visit.

742
00:48:58,687 --> 00:48:59,833
Free or not,

743
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,183
it's just too dangerous.

744
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:06,225
But let me ask you a question.

745
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,208
How do you like
the bounty hunting business?

746
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,044
Kill white folks and they pay you for it?

747
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,365
What's not to like?

748
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,970
Now I have to admit,
we make a good team.

749
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:27,930
I thought you was mad at me
for killing Big John and Lil Raj.

750
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,727
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

751
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:32,140
but normally, that's a good thing.

752
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,684
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

753
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:37,113
What you mean partner up?

754
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:41,721
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

755
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:45,483
I give you a third of my bounties.

756
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:48,519
So we make some money this winter,

757
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:50,144
and when the snow melts,

758
00:49:50,977 --> 00:49:53,037
I'll take you to Greenville myself,

759
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:56,388
and we'll find where they sent your wife.

760
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,586
Why you care what happen to me?

761
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:06,140
Why you care if I find my wife?

762
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:07,671
Frankly...

763
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:12,260
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

764
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:13,710
And now that I have,

765
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,033
I feel vaguely
responsible for you.

766
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:20,765
Plus when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

767
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,876
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

768
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,952
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

769
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:39,795
You got her.

770
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,795
What happened to Mr. I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money?

771
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:52,889
His son's with him.

772
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:54,132
Well, good.

773
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:56,055
He'll have a loved one with him.

774
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:58,430
Maybe even share a last word.

775
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,623
That's better than most of them get.

776
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:04,754
Damn sight better than he deserves.

777
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,551
Put down the rifle.

778
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:19,040
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

779
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,491
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

780
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,885
Read it aloud.

781
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,750
Consider that today's lesson.

782
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:35,483
Wanted. Dead or alive.

783
00:53:37,055 --> 00:53:39,923
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall g...

784
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:42,357
Gang.
Gang.

785
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:46,784
For murder and stagecoach...

786
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:49,304
Robbery.

787
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,898
Seven-zero-zero-zero..
Seven thousand.

788
00:53:53,353 --> 00:53:54,197
Thousand.

789
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:55,807
Seven thousand

790
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:56,905
Dollars,

791
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,564
for Smitty Bacall.

792
00:53:58,945 --> 00:53:59,793
One...

793
00:54:00,286 --> 00:54:02,936
thousand and five hundred dollars for...

794
00:54:03,101 --> 00:54:04,042
each of his...

795
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,343
gang...

796
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:08,350
Mem...
Members.

797
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:14,004
Known members of the Smitty Bacall
Gang are as follas.

798
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:16,006
Follows.
Follows.

799
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,085
Dandy Michaels,

800
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,542
Gerald Nash and...

801
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,568
Crazy Craig Koons.

802
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,239
That is...

803
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:26,577
who Smitty Bacall is.

804
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,818
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,

805
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,744
they would never have printed that.

806
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,774
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

807
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:38,466
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.

808
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,894
Do you want to save your wife,

809
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:42,414
by doing what I do?

810
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:44,955
This is what I do.

811
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:46,582
I kill people,

812
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,570
and sell their corpses for cash.

813
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,800
This corpse is worth $7,000.

814
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,766
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

815
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:06,762
Pa?

816
00:55:07,648 --> 00:55:08,424
Pa!

817
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,331
Here.

818
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,319
You need to keep
this Smitty Bacall handbill.

819
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:22,061
Why?

820
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:23,388
It's good luck.

821
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,024
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

822
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:16,006
That's accurate.

823
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:25,761
Doctor, Django,

824
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:26,994
how the hell are you?

825
00:57:28,556 --> 00:57:30,095
Who the hell-a you got there?

826
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,453
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

827
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:35,701
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

828
00:57:36,762 --> 00:57:39,472
Bad Chuck Wilson
and meaner Bobby Lowe

829
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:41,044
and three of their acolytes.

830
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:45,089
Well, just leave them out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

831
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,524
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

832
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:49,021
and get yourselves some coffee.

833
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,137
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

834
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:53,636
Pretty good.

835
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,423
Keep moving.

836
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,550
Get on up on that auction block.

837
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:34,470
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

838
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,155
Keep going!

839
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:56,418
Broomhilda Von Shaft.

840
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:57,927
Age 27.

841
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,121
'R' on right cheek.

842
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:04,042
Calvin Candie.

843
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:07,565
He owns the fourth biggest
cotton plantation in Mississippi.

844
00:59:07,566 --> 00:59:08,723
Candyland.

845
00:59:09,015 --> 00:59:09,980
Candyland?

846
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:11,602
Oh, so you've heard of it.

847
00:59:11,642 --> 00:59:13,316
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

848
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,163
Well apparently,
that's where your wife is...

849
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:19,182
and that's the repellant gentleman
who owns her.

850
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:22,043
Let's just hope she works in
the house, not in the field.

851
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:23,663
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

852
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,175
She... She pretty.

853
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:28,787
And she talk good, too.

854
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,493
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

855
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:35,439
burned that runaway r on her cheek...

856
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,409
they goddamned her.

857
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,828
She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough

858
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,016
for the house no more either.

859
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,399
They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.

860
00:59:48,497 --> 00:59:49,469
What's a comfort?

861
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:52,516
Not while I got freedom.

862
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,440
Not while I got my gun.

863
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,360
So do we offer to buy her?

864
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,334
So...

865
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:07,224
say...

866
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:10,990
a man,

867
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:12,680
wants to buy a horse.

868
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:14,884
Needs to buy a horse.

869
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,094
He walks up to the farmer's farm,

870
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,490
and he knocks on the farmer's door

871
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,395
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

872
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:23,191
And do you know what the farmer says?

873
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,239
The farmer says, no.

874
01:00:27,115 --> 01:00:29,354
Well, I say fuck that farmer,

875
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:31,358
and I'm stealing that horse.

876
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,744
Fair enough.
But now you're a horse thief,

877
01:00:34,745 --> 01:00:36,385
and they hang horse thieves.

878
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,852
Not to mention the horse goes back
to its original owner,

879
01:00:38,854 --> 01:00:40,511
because the horse is still his property.

880
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:41,867
We need her,

881
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:43,073
and...

882
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:44,407
we need a bill of sale.

883
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,512
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

884
01:00:48,183 --> 01:00:51,609
May I offer an alternative plan of action?

885
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:52,872
Go ahead.

886
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:54,202
So...

887
01:00:55,455 --> 01:00:56,484
the man,

888
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,185
walks up to the farmer's farm,

889
01:00:58,235 --> 01:00:59,778
he knocks on the farmer's door...

890
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,065
and asks,

891
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,592
not to buy the horse,

892
01:01:04,112 --> 01:01:05,536
but the farm.

893
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:09,334
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

894
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:12,025
the farmer is forced to say yes.

895
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,675
We gonna offer to buy Candyland?

896
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:15,822
No, it's far too big.

897
01:01:15,907 --> 01:01:18,715
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

898
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,711
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

899
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:23,427
What?

900
01:01:23,835 --> 01:01:26,914
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

901
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,809
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

902
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,548
Why?

903
01:01:30,204 --> 01:01:31,641
Because my character

904
01:01:31,642 --> 01:01:34,006
is that of a big money buyer
from Dusseldorf,

905
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:35,851
here in Greenville to buy my way

906
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:37,273
into the Mandingo fight game.

907
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,914
And your character

908
01:01:38,953 --> 01:01:41,361
is a Mandingo expert
I hired to help me do it.

909
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:42,995
They call that One-Eyed Charley.

910
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:47,713
Bonjour.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Good morning</i></font>

911
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:49,174
Bonsoir, <font color="#00ffff"><i>Good evening,</i></font>

912
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:51,116
ma petite femme noire.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>my little black woman.</i></font>

913
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:53,715
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

914
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:55,528
Entraz.

915
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,509
Thank you.

916
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,462
You want me to play a black slaver?

917
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,357
Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.

918
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:09,252
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

919
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:12,146
and buddy, that's pretty fucking low.

920
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,675
Then play him that way.

921
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,574
Give me your...

922
01:02:17,887 --> 01:02:19,730
black slaver.

923
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:25,892
♪ <i>Along came the 219. Toot! Toot!</i> ♪

924
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,412
♪ <i>Peanut butter!</i> ♪

925
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,881
Dr. Schultz!

926
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:34,856
Good to see you again!

927
01:02:34,857 --> 01:02:36,421
Mr. Moguy.

928
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,653
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

929
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,989
for this appointment.
Nonsense, it's my job.

930
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:45,558
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

931
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,858
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

932
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:50,902
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

933
01:02:51,088 --> 01:02:52,638
Just call me Leo.

934
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,113
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

935
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:58,998
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

936
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:01,168
Calvin's father
and I were about...

937
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,157
11 when we went
to boarding school together.

938
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:06,468
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

939
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

940
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,471
One could almost say youse a nigger.

941
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,601
What did you say?

942
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:17,039
I said...
Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

943
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:21,964
Anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

944
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:24,239
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

945
01:03:24,553 --> 01:03:26,044
What civilized people aren't?

946
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,600
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

947
01:03:28,603 --> 01:03:30,751
Si c'est cela qu'il prefere.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Whatever he prefers.</i></font>

948
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:32,323
He doesn't speak French.

949
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,705
Don't speak French to him,
it'll embarrass him.

950
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,318
Get back on top, now!
Turn around!

951
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,779
There you go.

952
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:43,456
There you go.

953
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:48,123
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

954
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,252
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

955
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:56,699
Quit stalling, now.

956
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:58,628
Answer the question.

957
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:02,370
The awful truth?

958
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:04,357
I'm bored.

959
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:06,679
This seems like a good bit of fun.

960
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,185
Well, come on over.

961
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,063
We got us a fight going on
that's a good bit of fun.

962
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,865
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

963
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:33,360
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man.

964
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:34,344
Even I know that.

965
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:45,038
Dr. Schultz.
What a rare pleasure.

966
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,173
Keep fighting, niggers.

967
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:48,239
And I might add, an honor.

968
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:49,707
Honor to meet you.

969
01:04:49,709 --> 01:04:51,760
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

970
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,323
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

971
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,365
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

972
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,969
Use your weight boy, use your weight!

973
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,081
There you go.

974
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,529
He's much bigger and stronger!

975
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:24,182
Come on, now!

976
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,446
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

977
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,488
Bravo Luigi, così e dai.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Good Luigi, go on.</i></font>

978
01:05:29,778 --> 01:05:31,034
Devi essere più rapido.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Be more faster.</i></font>

979
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,897
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

980
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:37,494
You either hit him or are you ain't?

981
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:43,256
Ecco I con la spola tappeto.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Make the carpet shuttle.</i></font>

982
01:05:43,346 --> 01:05:44,724
La spola tappeto giù!
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The carpet down!</i></font>

983
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:47,303
Big Fred, come on!

984
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,171
Turn him around!
Now...

985
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,600
Use your strength, boy!

986
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:58,164
Come on, now! Use your strength!

987
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:01,303
There you go!

988
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,480
There you go!

989
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,931
Look at that.

990
01:06:06,995 --> 01:06:09,104
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

991
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:11,640
Do what I told you, boy!

992
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:13,433
There you go!

993
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:16,267
No!
Do what I told ya!

994
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,393
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

995
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:23,401
Oh, no, Luigi.

996
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:44,953
Finish him.

997
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:50,943
Go on, boy, finish him!

998
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,597
That's why they call him Big Fred.

999
01:06:57,678 --> 01:06:59,322
Worth every penny.

1000
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:01,098
Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

1001
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,658
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

1002
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:06,226
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

1003
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,107
Mercedes.

1004
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:30,851
Tequila.

1005
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,267
What's your name?

1006
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:45,851
Django.

1007
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:49,841
Can you spell it?

1008
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,631
D-J-A-N

1009
01:07:55,012 --> 01:07:55,613
G

1010
01:07:56,018 --> 01:07:56,677
O

1011
01:07:58,256 --> 01:07:59,489
The D is silent.

1012
01:08:00,252 --> 01:08:01,002
I know.

1013
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:09,481
Umberto, andiamo.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Umberto, let's go.</i></font>

1014
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,375
Mr. Moguy,

1015
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,875
want you to take care
of my new boy here.

1016
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:15,005
You find him a room with a soft bed,

1017
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,258
then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole.

1018
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,618
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

1019
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,680
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1020
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,218
Before you go Roscoe,

1021
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:25,342
get Fred here a tall beer.

1022
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:30,791
You enjoy that, boy.

1023
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,401
You've earned it.

1024
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,581
Yes sir.

1025
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,560
What's your name, boy?

1026
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,166
His name is Django Freeman.

1027
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,181
Where'd you dig him up?

1028
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,653
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

1029
01:08:57,616 --> 01:08:59,101
I've heard tell about you.

1030
01:09:00,374 --> 01:09:03,468
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

1031
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,418
Ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying. I'm curious...

1032
01:09:07,379 --> 01:09:09,454
what makes you such
a Mandingo expert?

1033
01:09:11,783 --> 01:09:13,941
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

1034
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:19,431
What did you say, boy?
Calm down, Butch.

1035
01:09:20,743 --> 01:09:21,966
No offense given...

1036
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,734
none taken.

1037
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,128
Monsieur Candie...

1038
01:09:26,136 --> 01:09:29,485
I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

1039
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,442
One...

1040
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,839
you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

1041
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:35,883
Yes!

1042
01:09:36,154 --> 01:09:37,842
I'll have a beer. Wunderbar.

1043
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,302
Roscoe, a beer for the man
with the beard,

1044
01:09:40,304 --> 01:09:42,263
and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.

1045
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:43,586
Do not spare the rum.

1046
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,011
Doc.

1047
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:47,821
I am a seasoned slaver.

1048
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:48,765
You are well,

1049
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,023
you are a neophyte.

1050
01:09:50,025 --> 01:09:52,696
I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy here,

1051
01:09:52,758 --> 01:09:54,706
is taking advantage of you.

1052
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:57,962
With all due respect,

1053
01:09:58,536 --> 01:09:59,410
Monsieur Candie...

1054
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:02,214
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

1055
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:04,823
I sought you out to purchase
a fighting nigger

1056
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,749
at above top-dollar market price.

1057
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:10,236
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

1058
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:12,240
it would be to discuss business.

1059
01:10:15,456 --> 01:10:17,053
Well, we weren't talking business yet.

1060
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:19,607
We were discussing my curiosity.

1061
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,287
Thank you.

1062
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:24,398
Roscoe,

1063
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:26,034
Coco, go outside and play.

1064
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:29,294
Sheba...

1065
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,145
you stay right there.

1066
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
I know you didn't mean me.

1067
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:36,255
Prost!

1068
01:10:36,827 --> 01:10:37,635
German.

1069
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,065
Now, according to Moguy,

1070
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,448
if I do business with you,

1071
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,658
I'm doing business with both you all.

1072
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:46,638
He does the eyeballing,
you the billfold?

1073
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:47,385
Is that it?

1074
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:50,286
Well, you don't make
it sound too flattering,

1075
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,518
but more or less, yeah.

1076
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,606
So...

1077
01:10:55,426 --> 01:10:56,386
Bright Boy.

1078
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,372
Moguy tells me you looked
over my African flesh

1079
01:10:59,373 --> 01:11:01,001
and you was none too impressed?

1080
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,823
Not for top dollar.

1081
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:07,222
Well, then, we got nothing more
to talk about.

1082
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:09,632
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

1083
01:11:09,768 --> 01:11:12,156
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

1084
01:11:12,203 --> 01:11:14,238
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

1085
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,197
He wants the nigger,

1086
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:17,867
you don't wanna sell.

1087
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,863
I don't sell,

1088
01:11:19,864 --> 01:11:22,344
the niggers, I don't wanna sell.

1089
01:11:25,058 --> 01:11:25,924
Well,

1090
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:28,333
you won't sell your best.

1091
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:30,722
You won't even sell your second best.

1092
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,188
But your third best?

1093
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:34,736
You don't want to sell him either.

1094
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:38,875
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

1095
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,994
who knows what could happen?

1096
01:11:44,435 --> 01:11:46,264
And what do you consider ridiculous?

1097
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,824
For a truly talented specimen,

1098
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,447
the right nigger?

1099
01:11:53,565 --> 01:11:55,049
How much would you say, Django?

1100
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,159
$12,000.

1101
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:06,169
Well, gentlemen,

1102
01:12:07,086 --> 01:12:08,603
you had my curiosity,

1103
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:10,807
but now you have my attention.

1104
01:12:25,048 --> 01:12:25,834
Willie.

1105
01:12:27,628 --> 01:12:29,049
Hold up! Hold up.

1106
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:31,878
Good morning, gentlemen.

1107
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:33,521
Good Dr. Schultz.

1108
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,099
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1109
01:12:35,774 --> 01:12:37,187
You couldn't have picked a better one.

1110
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,278
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

1111
01:12:40,516 --> 01:12:42,059
Oh, thank you very much.

1112
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,063
You can tie your horse up back there.

1113
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:53,453
Django.

1114
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:02,206
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

1115
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,036
is I believe there is a level above bright,

1116
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:07,509
above talented,

1117
01:13:07,935 --> 01:13:09,742
above loyal that a nigger,

1118
01:13:09,743 --> 01:13:11,358
can aspire to.

1119
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:13,966
Say, one nigger that just...

1120
01:13:13,967 --> 01:13:16,041
pops up in 10,000.

1121
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,312
The exceptional nigger.

1122
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,138
Bright day, Bright Boy?

1123
01:13:22,626 --> 01:13:23,540
Sun is up.

1124
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,381
Shining on all of us.

1125
01:13:31,642 --> 01:13:32,535
Have a seat, doc.

1126
01:13:33,693 --> 01:13:34,369
Thank you.

1127
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:35,729
Quite an honor.

1128
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,655
The honor is all ours.

1129
01:13:37,657 --> 01:13:39,747
Thank you, but I do believe,

1130
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,184
that given time,

1131
01:13:41,563 --> 01:13:44,217
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...

1132
01:13:45,476 --> 01:13:47,006
become if not frequent...

1133
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,714
more frequent.

1134
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,177
Bright Boy,

1135
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:56,061
you are that one in 10,000.

1136
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:58,035
The name of the game is keep up,

1137
01:13:58,036 --> 01:13:59,436
not catch up, nigger.

1138
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:18,097
Touch your guns, you die.
Everybody, calm down!

1139
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,159
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

1140
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,265
Are you kidding me?

1141
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,213
This nigger just...
I said no harm done!

1142
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:26,111
Now take your hand off your pistol!

1143
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:28,711
Butch,

1144
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,676
that means you too.

1145
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,670
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

1146
01:14:36,454 --> 01:14:37,079
Hoot!

1147
01:14:37,756 --> 01:14:39,131
Get back up on your horse.

1148
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,145
He broke my collarbone!

1149
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:43,018
For God's sake, somebody please

1150
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,681
help Hoot here back up
on his goddamn horse.

1151
01:14:45,906 --> 01:14:46,828
Yes sir, boss.

1152
01:14:47,031 --> 01:14:49,006
Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

1153
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:51,776
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

1154
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:54,241
Oh, I'm gonna go walking in
the moonlight with you.

1155
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:55,909
You wanna hold my hand?

1156
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:03,316
Willie,

1157
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:05,155
take us home.

1158
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,982
Start moving!

1159
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,055
Head them out!

1160
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:04,464
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?

1161
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:05,757
No, sir.

1162
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:07,540
You want a boot heel in it?

1163
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:09,662
No, sir.

1164
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,197
Then you keep your goddamn
eyeballs off me.

1165
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:16,108
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1166
01:16:16,476 --> 01:16:17,761
Now move, nigger!

1167
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,954
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1168
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm worse than any
of these white men here.

1169
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:27,520
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1170
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:29,230
He is,

1171
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:31,070
a rambunctious sort, ain't he?

1172
01:16:31,644 --> 01:16:32,543
Indeed.

1173
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:38,510
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1174
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:42,334
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1175
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:44,281
so before that moment,

1176
01:16:44,282 --> 01:16:45,786
it would be good if I could have

1177
01:16:45,788 --> 01:16:48,810
a confidential strategy meeting with my...

1178
01:16:49,206 --> 01:16:50,023
confidant.

1179
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:54,985
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1180
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,030
I confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.

1181
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:02,142
You're sure it's her?

1182
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:03,992
He didn't call her by name,

1183
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,202
but she's a young lady,

1184
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,184
whip marks on her back
and speaks German.

1185
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,605
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1186
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:11,932
in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

1187
01:17:12,176 --> 01:17:13,219
Point being,

1188
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:16,498
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

1189
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

1190
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,908
You think I lost sight of that?
Yes, I do.

1191
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:23,047
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1192
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:25,822
You're going to blow
this whole charade,

1193
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:28,696
or more than likely
get us both killed.

1194
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,907
And I for one, don't intend to die,

1195
01:17:30,908 --> 01:17:33,541
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1196
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:35,221
I'm not antagonizing him.

1197
01:17:35,222 --> 01:17:36,570
I'm intriguing him.

1198
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:39,523
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.

1199
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:41,631
I recall the man,

1200
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:45,704
who had me kill another man
in front of his son

1201
01:17:46,138 --> 01:17:47,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

1202
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:50,272
You remember that?

1203
01:17:52,577 --> 01:17:53,911
Yeah, of course I remember.

1204
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:55,398
What you said was...

1205
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:57,116
that this is my world...

1206
01:17:58,515 --> 01:17:59,987
and in my world you got to get dirty.

1207
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:02,770
So that's what I'm doing.

1208
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:04,116
I'm getting dirty.

1209
01:18:08,144 --> 01:18:11,314
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1210
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,297
that was the general gist.

1211
01:18:18,295 --> 01:18:20,064
See you at Candyland.

1212
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:28,731
Alright, niggers,

1213
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,207
back at it.

1214
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:33,289
That means you too, Moonlight.

1215
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,262
I'll be.

1216
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,562
D'Artagnan!

1217
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:26,964
Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?

1218
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,665
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1219
01:19:30,053 --> 01:19:31,099
Yes, you can.

1220
01:19:31,537 --> 01:19:33,844
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1221
01:19:34,869 --> 01:19:37,403
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1222
01:19:37,614 --> 01:19:38,868
I cannot hear myself think!

1223
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:40,177
Quiet down, Marsha!

1224
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:42,639
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1225
01:19:42,826 --> 01:19:44,256
Hush up! Hey!

1226
01:19:44,314 --> 01:19:46,815
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1227
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,352
Come on now, boy...

1228
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,790
get on out that tree.

1229
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,909
Yes sir.

1230
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:25,670
How long was he loose?

1231
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:27,384
A night.

1232
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:28,855
Day.

1233
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:31,083
Half the other night.

1234
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:33,881
How far he get off the property?

1235
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:35,999
About 20 miles off the prop.

1236
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:38,738
Pretty far considering that limp he got.

1237
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:41,986
Mr. Moguy,

1238
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:44,424
who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1239
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:45,911
One of this new lot.

1240
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:48,712
Well, way he looks now,

1241
01:20:48,713 --> 01:20:50,424
a blind Indian would
not bet a bead on him.

1242
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:53,204
Please Monsieur Candie,
I ain't got it in me no more.

1243
01:20:53,206 --> 01:20:54,414
Now, now, now, now, now.
I can't...

1244
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,242
Now, no... begging.

1245
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,388
No playing on my soft heart.

1246
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:04,612
You're in trouble, now son.

1247
01:21:04,613 --> 01:21:05,656
Yes sir.

1248
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:09,232
You know.

1249
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,854
I done paid $500 for you.

1250
01:21:12,677 --> 01:21:14,826
When I pay $500 then…

1251
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:17,448
I expect to get five fights out of a nigger

1252
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:19,092
before he roll over and play dead.

1253
01:21:19,093 --> 01:21:19,874
Sir.

1254
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:21,455
You got to understand,

1255
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,121
that I'm running a business here.

1256
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:25,889
You fought three fights.

1257
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,120
But I won every one.

1258
01:21:27,122 --> 01:21:28,055
Yes, you did.

1259
01:21:28,056 --> 01:21:31,471
Yes, you did but that last one, you muddled
the line between winning and losing.

1260
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:32,507
Yes sir.

1261
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,845
Still, the fact remains.

1262
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,822
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1263
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:43,415
So what about my $500?

1264
01:21:46,058 --> 01:21:47,611
What about my $500?

1265
01:21:49,358 --> 01:21:50,702
You gonna reimburse me?

1266
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:59,054
You even know what reimburse means?

1267
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,034
I'll reimburse you!

1268
01:22:13,317 --> 01:22:14,111
You will?

1269
01:22:15,775 --> 01:22:16,511
Yep.

1270
01:22:20,106 --> 01:22:21,822
You'll pay $500,

1271
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:26,280
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1272
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:27,371
No, he won't.

1273
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:31,580
He just tired of you toying with him is all.

1274
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:34,317
Matter of fact, so am I.

1275
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,232
But we ain't paying a penny
for that pickaninny.

1276
01:22:37,596 --> 01:22:39,476
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1277
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:41,982
You heard him.

1278
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:55,428
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1279
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:59,168
He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.

1280
01:23:00,019 --> 01:23:01,638
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1281
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,198
That right.

1282
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,487
For that matter...

1283
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:10,351
nor have I.

1284
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:17,767
Now...

1285
01:23:19,045 --> 01:23:22,248
seeing as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1286
01:23:24,892 --> 01:23:27,920
you won't mind me handling
this nigger any way I see fit?

1287
01:23:29,323 --> 01:23:30,542
He's your nigger.

1288
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:36,049
Mr. Stonesipher?

1289
01:23:37,815 --> 01:23:40,642
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1290
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:45,882
Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

1291
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,984
Get him, get him!

1292
01:23:51,146 --> 01:23:52,190
Yeah!

1293
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:26,044
Your boss looks
a little green around the gills

1294
01:24:26,046 --> 01:24:27,856
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1295
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,051
Nah,

1296
01:24:29,896 --> 01:24:32,744
he just ain't used to seeing a
man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1297
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,866
You are used to it?

1298
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,879
I'm just a little more used
to Americans than he is.

1299
01:24:41,645 --> 01:24:42,353
Now,

1300
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,479
Monsieur Candie...

1301
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,280
whenever you're ready.

1302
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:49,770
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1303
01:24:50,456 --> 01:24:51,753
Let's get to it.

1304
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,705
Because as of now, if he's an example,

1305
01:24:56,396 --> 01:24:57,612
I ain't impressed.

1306
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:01,244
Follow me.

1307
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,210
Line them up to the left here now, boy.

1308
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,476
Stand up straight, now!

1309
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
Get up there.

1310
01:27:06,874 --> 01:27:08,079
Get up there, boy.

1311
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:09,441
Come on.

1312
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,483
Give me a line!
Give me a line!

1313
01:27:11,596 --> 01:27:13,614
Get in line there!
Straighten up!

1314
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,201
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1315
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,548
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1316
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:20,838
Who, this nigger up on that nag?

1317
01:28:21,352 --> 01:28:22,740
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?

1318
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,808
What's a matter?
Why you so ornery?

1319
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:26,692
You miss me?
Oh, yes sir.

1320
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:28,574
I miss you,

1321
01:28:28,681 --> 01:28:30,762
like a hog miss slop!

1322
01:28:30,851 --> 01:28:34,179
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1323
01:28:34,903 --> 01:28:38,938
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

1324
01:28:41,384 --> 01:28:42,884
Now I ask you,

1325
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,993
who this nigger on that nag?

1326
01:28:45,995 --> 01:28:46,982
Hey, Snowball?

1327
01:28:48,805 --> 01:28:50,784
Wanna know my name
or the name of my horse,

1328
01:28:51,233 --> 01:28:52,203
you ask me.

1329
01:28:52,622 --> 01:28:55,446
Just who the hell you calling
Snowball, horse boy?

1330
01:28:55,547 --> 01:28:56,893
I'll snatch your black ass

1331
01:28:56,894 --> 01:28:58,654
off that nag there
and in the mud so fast...

1332
01:28:58,656 --> 01:29:00,638
make your head spin.
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1333
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:02,317
Let's keep it funny.

1334
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:04,658
Django here's a free man.

1335
01:29:05,703 --> 01:29:07,699
This nigger here?
That nigger there.

1336
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,263
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1337
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,450
Django,

1338
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:14,334
this is another cheeky black
bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1339
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,087
Stephen, this here's Django.

1340
01:29:16,387 --> 01:29:17,645
You two oughta hate each other.

1341
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:18,729
Calvin,

1342
01:29:18,829 --> 01:29:22,082
just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1343
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:26,068
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1344
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:27,743
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1345
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:31,538
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1346
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,026
You understand that?
Yes sir. Him I understand.

1347
01:29:34,028 --> 01:29:35,862
But I don't know why I got to
take lip off this nigger.

1348
01:29:35,863 --> 01:29:38,291
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1349
01:29:39,573 --> 01:29:41,074
Yes sir. I understand.

1350
01:29:41,077 --> 01:29:42,387
Well, good.

1351
01:29:42,865 --> 01:29:43,776
They're spending the night.

1352
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,593
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1353
01:29:46,953 --> 01:29:48,621
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1354
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:50,430
Stephen, he's a slaver.

1355
01:29:50,596 --> 01:29:52,570
It's different.
In The Big House?

1356
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:53,977
Well, you got a problem with that?

1357
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:56,449
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1358
01:29:56,574 --> 01:29:58,801
if you ain't got no problem
with burning the bed, the sheets,

1359
01:29:58,919 --> 01:30:00,796
the pillowcases, everything else

1360
01:30:00,797 --> 01:30:02,299
when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
That is my problem!

1361
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,374
They are mine to burn!

1362
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,776
Now your problem right now
is making a good impression!

1363
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:08,145
And I want you to start solving
that problem right now

1364
01:30:08,193 --> 01:30:09,819
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1365
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:13,148
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1366
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,083
Go on, now.

1367
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1368
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,975
Your daddy rolling over
in his goddamned grave.

1369
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:24,821
Man, the lip on him.
He's getting worse and worse.

1370
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:25,835
Now,

1371
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:30,772
where is my beautiful sister?

1372
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:32,566
There she is!

1373
01:30:34,701 --> 01:30:35,849
Dr. Schultz,

1374
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:39,393
this attractive Southern belle
is my widowed sister.

1375
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,479
Darling,

1376
01:30:41,122 --> 01:30:43,564
you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1377
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:46,299
May I present to you,

1378
01:30:46,424 --> 01:30:48,445
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1379
01:30:48,593 --> 01:30:52,052
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1380
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:54,362
Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
Let's go.

1381
01:30:54,364 --> 01:30:55,407
You know where it is.

1382
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:56,924
Like you on a rope!

1383
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:00,877
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1384
01:31:02,036 --> 01:31:03,637
Monsieur Candie?

1385
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:05,929
Yeah.

1386
01:31:06,178 --> 01:31:08,678
About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1387
01:31:09,059 --> 01:31:10,018
Nigger gal?

1388
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,353
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1389
01:31:14,255 --> 01:31:15,834
Yes! Hilda, what about her?

1390
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,816
Do you think before the demonstration,

1391
01:31:18,817 --> 01:31:20,450
you could send her around to my room?

1392
01:31:20,889 --> 01:31:22,949
You little dickens, you.

1393
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:24,930
I don't see why not.

1394
01:31:24,932 --> 01:31:25,658
Stephen,

1395
01:31:25,659 --> 01:31:28,392
when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hilda,

1396
01:31:28,394 --> 01:31:30,507
get her cleaned up
and smelling real nice,

1397
01:31:30,531 --> 01:31:31,654
and sent over
to Dr. Schultz's room here.

1398
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:33,822
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1399
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,325
there is a something
I ain't told you about yet.

1400
01:31:36,685 --> 01:31:37,410
What?

1401
01:31:37,865 --> 01:31:40,068
Hilda in the Hot Box.

1402
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,170
What's she doing there?

1403
01:31:43,347 --> 01:31:45,847
What you think she doing there
in the Hot Box?

1404
01:31:45,912 --> 01:31:46,998
She being punished.

1405
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,744
What she do?
She run off again.

1406
01:31:50,432 --> 01:31:53,269
Jesus Christ Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1407
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:53,811
Two.

1408
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:55,682
When did she go?

1409
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,094
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1410
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,269
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1411
01:32:02,038 --> 01:32:05,456
Lucky for her, they was out
chasing D'Artagnan's ass.

1412
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:07,497
Bill and Cody went looking for her,

1413
01:32:07,499 --> 01:32:09,031
found her, brung her back.

1414
01:32:10,217 --> 01:32:11,526
Now, she a little beat-up.

1415
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,227
But she done that
to her own damn self

1416
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:14,475
running through them damn
bushes and shit.

1417
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:16,026
How long she been in the box?

1418
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,338
How long you think she been in there?
All damn day.

1419
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,029
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1420
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:24,015
Still, take her out.

1421
01:32:24,179 --> 01:32:25,453
Take her out? Why?

1422
01:32:25,455 --> 01:32:27,394
Because I said so, that's why.

1423
01:32:27,395 --> 01:32:29,376
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1424
01:32:29,526 --> 01:32:30,736
Hilda is my nigger.

1425
01:32:30,738 --> 01:32:32,458
Southern hospitality dictates,

1426
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:34,032
I make her available to him.

1427
01:32:34,034 --> 01:32:35,889
But, Monsieur
Candie, she run off.

1428
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,253
Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1429
01:32:37,255 --> 01:32:39,856
What is the point of having
a nigger that speaks German

1430
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:42,352
if you can't wheel them out
when you have a German guest?

1431
01:32:42,577 --> 01:32:46,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1432
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:47,647
Yes sir.

1433
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:50,303
Lara Lee!

1434
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,963
Will you and Cora be responsible

1435
01:32:52,022 --> 01:32:55,551
for getting Hilda cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1436
01:32:55,646 --> 01:32:57,023
Of course, darling.

1437
01:32:57,073 --> 01:32:59,093
Now gentlemen, I do apologize,

1438
01:32:59,094 --> 01:33:01,953
but I am weary from
our travels beyond words.

1439
01:33:02,345 --> 01:33:04,722
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1440
01:33:09,957 --> 01:33:12,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1441
01:33:13,144 --> 01:33:14,027
Cora!

1442
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:15,001
Come here!

1443
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:17,215
Get over there and get her cleaned up,

1444
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:18,700
bring her back over here to Dr...

1445
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:21,042
What he say your name is? Shoots?
Schultz.

1446
01:33:21,386 --> 01:33:22,399
Schultz.

1447
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,003
Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1448
01:33:24,005 --> 01:33:24,731
Yes sir.

1449
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:12,057
Come on, girl.

1450
01:34:12,724 --> 01:34:13,524
Stand up.

1451
01:34:43,694 --> 01:34:46,935
Is you coming with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1452
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,737
Hello, ladies.

1453
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:24,969
Dr. Schultz.

1454
01:36:25,485 --> 01:36:27,344
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1455
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,126
Hilda, this is Dr. Schultz.

1456
01:36:35,522 --> 01:36:37,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1457
01:36:38,906 --> 01:36:40,880
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1458
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:44,008
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1459
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1460
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:53,979
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1461
01:36:57,789 --> 01:36:59,587
The doctor here speaks German.

1462
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:04,009
And I've been informed
you do as well?

1463
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,573
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1464
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:17,842
Astonishing.

1465
01:37:25,054 --> 01:37:26,639
And I shall bring you...
Much obliged.

1466
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,431
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

1467
01:37:58,586 --> 01:38:00,032
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't be afraid.</i></font>

1468
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,355
Don't be afraid.

1469
01:38:42,103 --> 01:38:42,962
Pardon.

1470
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:51,719
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

1471
01:40:20,534 --> 01:40:22,222
<font color="#ffff00">I promise.</font>

1472
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:39,089
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1473
01:40:48,274 --> 01:40:50,732
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1474
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:54,297
Hurry up, girl.
These ready, Miss Cora.

1475
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:55,835
No, no, no, they drinking tonight.

1476
01:40:55,851 --> 01:40:58,576
Go downstairs, get the big jug with
the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1477
01:40:58,758 --> 01:41:00,349
Get your big pretty ass out the way.

1478
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:01,746
You know you like it.

1479
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,056
That's because you knows what I like.

1480
01:41:04,127 --> 01:41:06,794
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1481
01:41:07,011 --> 01:41:08,121
Look, Monsieur Candie,

1482
01:41:08,603 --> 01:41:11,916
they were all fine specimens,
no doubt about it.

1483
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:15,518
But the best three by far were...

1484
01:41:15,956 --> 01:41:16,898
Samson.

1485
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,966
What's that other one's name?
Goldie.

1486
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:21,043
Goldie.

1487
01:41:21,546 --> 01:41:23,097
And Eskimo Joe.

1488
01:41:23,789 --> 01:41:25,991
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1489
01:41:26,532 --> 01:41:29,460
You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1490
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold.

1491
01:41:32,214 --> 01:41:33,357
Who knows?

1492
01:41:36,354 --> 01:41:37,540
Well, regardless,

1493
01:41:37,928 --> 01:41:39,316
Samson's your best.

1494
01:41:39,898 --> 01:41:41,066
We all know that.

1495
01:41:41,559 --> 01:41:42,838
You will never sell him,

1496
01:41:42,965 --> 01:41:43,973
and I can see why.

1497
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:45,703
He's a champion.

1498
01:41:47,012 --> 01:41:48,707
All three are champions.

1499
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:50,943
Samson's the champion.

1500
01:41:52,143 --> 01:41:53,501
Them other two pretty good.

1501
01:41:55,197 --> 01:41:56,628
Calvin, now what's this nigger you let...

1502
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:58,033
It's alright. It's alright.

1503
01:41:58,097 --> 01:41:59,758
You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,

1504
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,753
while admittedly a neophyte,
in the nigger fight game,

1505
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:08,247
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1506
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,333
Is that right?

1507
01:42:09,644 --> 01:42:10,663
Hence,

1508
01:42:10,888 --> 01:42:13,587
I have big ideas when
it comes to presentation.

1509
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,150
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1510
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:21,478
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1511
01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:23,626
Need to have what? What?
Panache.

1512
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:27,728
A sense of Showmanship.
Showmanship, yes.

1513
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,409
I want to be able to bill him

1514
01:42:29,612 --> 01:42:31,397
as The Black Hercules.

1515
01:42:32,949 --> 01:42:34,595
The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1516
01:42:34,673 --> 01:42:35,674
More like Nigger-les.

1517
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:39,906
I said and I told,

1518
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:42,279
I would pay top dollar,

1519
01:42:42,529 --> 01:42:43,251
for...

1520
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:45,863
the right nigger.

1521
01:42:46,794 --> 01:42:50,063
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1522
01:42:51,218 --> 01:42:53,616
But is he right as rain?

1523
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,289
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1524
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:58,201
I will have you know,

1525
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,555
there is no one,

1526
01:42:59,556 --> 01:43:00,622
in the nigger fight game

1527
01:43:00,694 --> 01:43:02,880
that appreciates the value
of showmanship

1528
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:04,946
more than Monsieur Calvin
J. Candie here.

1529
01:43:04,948 --> 01:43:05,804
Nobody.

1530
01:43:05,917 --> 01:43:09,184
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.

1531
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,923
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1532
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,109
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1533
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,356
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1534
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:20,956
then you can start,

1535
01:43:20,957 --> 01:43:22,694
to implement a grand design.

1536
01:43:23,513 --> 01:43:24,514
In other words,

1537
01:43:24,617 --> 01:43:26,281
first thing is first.

1538
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
First thing's first.

1539
01:43:36,896 --> 01:43:38,747
I see you two getting on.

1540
01:43:39,742 --> 01:43:40,791
Famously.

1541
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:43,080
Oh, Monsieur Candie,

1542
01:43:43,081 --> 01:43:44,654
you can't imagine what it's like

1543
01:43:44,656 --> 01:43:46,846
not to hear your native tongue,

1544
01:43:46,847 --> 01:43:48,051
in four years.

1545
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:50,353
Well, hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1546
01:43:52,516 --> 01:43:53,926
Two weeks in Boston!

1547
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:56,146
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1548
01:43:57,302 --> 01:43:58,997
Two weeks in Boston!

1549
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:02,525
I can't express the joy I felt

1550
01:44:02,526 --> 01:44:04,489
conversing in my mother tongue.

1551
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,988
And Hilda is a charming
conversation companion.

1552
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:11,198
Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.

1553
01:44:11,518 --> 01:44:13,707
You might-a caught yourself
a little dose of nigger love.

1554
01:44:14,329 --> 01:44:16,340
Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1555
01:44:16,825 --> 01:44:18,578
It's like a pool of black tar.

1556
01:44:18,624 --> 01:44:20,251
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1557
01:44:20,388 --> 01:44:21,947
Yes sir, you stuck.

1558
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:24,573
I don't know, doctor.

1559
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:27,342
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1560
01:44:27,408 --> 01:44:28,267
but...

1561
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:31,740
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1562
01:44:34,552 --> 01:44:35,312
Well,

1563
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:36,987
naturally.

1564
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:38,736
It is the soaring,

1565
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:40,690
eagle that attracts her attention,

1566
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:42,312
not the plucked chicken.

1567
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,661
Dr. Schultz,
don't be so down on yourself.

1568
01:44:46,663 --> 01:44:48,575
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1569
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,608
You got to clean these dishes,

1570
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,900
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1571
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:54,006
You know that nigger, don't you?

1572
01:44:55,204 --> 01:44:56,325
Who?
Who?

1573
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,031
Don't who me, bitch.
You know who I'm talking about.

1574
01:45:01,463 --> 01:45:02,594
At the table?

1575
01:45:03,486 --> 01:45:04,633
I don't know him.

1576
01:45:05,052 --> 01:45:06,430
You don't know him.

1577
01:45:06,838 --> 01:45:07,649
No.

1578
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,038
No, what?

1579
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:10,665
No, sir.

1580
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,611
You would not lie to me now, would you?

1581
01:45:22,384 --> 01:45:23,263
Ok.

1582
01:45:24,829 --> 01:45:27,729
Yeah. If you say so.

1583
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:35,921
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,

1584
01:45:36,492 --> 01:45:37,518
no doubt about it.

1585
01:45:39,275 --> 01:45:40,375
But if it was my money,

1586
01:45:42,113 --> 01:45:44,250
I would not pay no $12,000 for him.

1587
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:46,259
What would your price be?

1588
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1589
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:50,371
and I don't know why,

1590
01:45:50,497 --> 01:45:52,276
I would be inclined to be generous...

1591
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:54,641
9,000.

1592
01:45:56,135 --> 01:45:56,807
Maybe.

1593
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:58,851
Dr. Schultz,

1594
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,921
let me reclarify how this whole

1595
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:03,692
negotiation came about.

1596
01:46:04,204 --> 01:46:06,437
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1597
01:46:06,507 --> 01:46:07,286
Sure wasn't.

1598
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:09,309
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1599
01:46:09,339 --> 01:46:10,257
Sure was.

1600
01:46:10,429 --> 01:46:14,358
Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been
bandying about, that ain't too far off from right.

1601
01:46:14,365 --> 01:46:16,283
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1602
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:18,623
I could do so any day of the week.
Any day.

1603
01:46:19,162 --> 01:46:21,116
But, like you said in Greenville, doctor...

1604
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,100
I don't want to sell him.

1605
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:24,993
It was only your...

1606
01:46:25,601 --> 01:46:28,409
ridiculous offer of $12,000

1607
01:46:28,411 --> 01:46:30,330
that made me even consider it.

1608
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:43,190
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1609
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,980
Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1610
01:46:49,982 --> 01:46:52,259
Eskimo Joe, $12,000.

1611
01:46:52,466 --> 01:46:53,420
Hooray, doctor.

1612
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:55,492
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1613
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,956
However, that is a tremendous
amount of money.

1614
01:46:59,391 --> 01:47:02,454
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1615
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1616
01:47:04,727 --> 01:47:07,919
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1617
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:11,464
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1618
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:14,124
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined,

1619
01:47:14,126 --> 01:47:16,516
by a physician of my choosing.
Naturally.

1620
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:21,002
So, say I return in about...

1621
01:47:23,848 --> 01:47:25,941
five days time.
Five days?

1622
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,475
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1623
01:47:27,695 --> 01:47:29,951
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy,

1624
01:47:29,953 --> 01:47:32,199
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1625
01:47:33,732 --> 01:47:35,365
I say splendid, doctor.

1626
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:36,698
Splendid.

1627
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,305
Gentlemen...

1628
01:47:39,707 --> 01:47:41,267
may I propose a toast.

1629
01:47:43,974 --> 01:47:45,627
To Eskimo Joe.

1630
01:47:45,628 --> 01:47:47,571
Or shall we call him.

1631
01:47:47,945 --> 01:47:49,216
The Black Hercules?

1632
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,591
To The Black Hercules.

1633
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,135
The Black Hercules.

1634
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
To The Black Hercules.

1635
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:56,319
You was right, doctor.

1636
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,777
That name do have pan-ass.

1637
01:48:00,775 --> 01:48:01,489
Hilda,

1638
01:48:02,406 --> 01:48:03,543
top my drink off.

1639
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:07,780
So Hilda,

1640
01:48:08,498 --> 01:48:10,925
how you like serving
at the big table in The Big House?

1641
01:48:12,135 --> 01:48:14,562
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1642
01:48:15,526 --> 01:48:17,403
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1643
01:48:18,536 --> 01:48:22,476
It's a lot better than sizzling in that Hot Box
or dragging your ass through a bramble bush.

1644
01:48:22,908 --> 01:48:26,220
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
getting to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1645
01:48:26,222 --> 01:48:27,173
Sugar bear?
Oh, Lord.

1646
01:48:27,174 --> 01:48:27,940
She like them niggers.

1647
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:28,936
Sure do.
Like Samson?

1648
01:48:28,945 --> 01:48:29,984
No, sir.

1649
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1650
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,162
the doctor here might be interested
in seeing Hilda's peeled back,

1651
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:39,183
seeing as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1652
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:40,603
Dr. Schultz,

1653
01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:42,365
when you was alone with Hilda, here,

1654
01:48:42,366 --> 01:48:44,114
did you just speak German or...

1655
01:48:44,115 --> 01:48:45,411
did you get to take her clothes off?

1656
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:46,830
No, we just talked and...

1657
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:49,078
Oh, so you haven't seen her back?

1658
01:48:49,587 --> 01:48:51,684
I haven't...
No, no, no, no.

1659
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:53,599
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1660
01:48:53,841 --> 01:48:56,908
Hilda, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1661
01:48:57,056 --> 01:48:58,347
Go on.
Calvin.

1662
01:48:59,177 --> 01:49:01,369
I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

1663
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,637
But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz
is from Dusseldorf.

1664
01:49:04,806 --> 01:49:06,208
They don't got niggers there.

1665
01:49:06,209 --> 01:49:07,876
He is a man of medicine.

1666
01:49:07,946 --> 01:49:10,735
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1667
01:49:10,844 --> 01:49:14,291
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1668
01:49:14,377 --> 01:49:16,850
Hilda's got something
like four lashes on her back.

1669
01:49:16,852 --> 01:49:19,199
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1670
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:20,331
Sure would.
Look at that, doctor.

1671
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:22,042
It's like a painting. Look at that.
Calvin!

1672
01:49:23,073 --> 01:49:25,946
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1673
01:49:28,407 --> 01:49:30,190
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1674
01:49:30,743 --> 01:49:32,078
After dinner, then, Stephen.

1675
01:49:32,227 --> 01:49:33,104
After dinner.

1676
01:49:34,463 --> 01:49:35,744
During the brandies, gentlemen?

1677
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,954
Cora, come get this girl!

1678
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:48,446
She a mess.

1679
01:49:48,879 --> 01:49:49,802
Yes, ma'am.

1680
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:52,350
Why are you all undone?

1681
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:53,345
I just got you done up.

1682
01:49:53,347 --> 01:49:54,552
Come on in here.

1683
01:50:01,263 --> 01:50:03,442
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,

1684
01:50:03,443 --> 01:50:05,280
and you need to be on his blind side.

1685
01:50:05,396 --> 01:50:07,231
You say you ain't know him.

1686
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:10,618
I said,

1687
01:50:11,526 --> 01:50:14,682
you said you ain't know him.

1688
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:17,300
I don't.

1689
01:50:18,453 --> 01:50:19,510
Yes, you do.

1690
01:50:22,186 --> 01:50:23,306
Mr. Stephen...

1691
01:50:24,721 --> 01:50:25,495
I don't.

1692
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,833
Why is you lying to me?

1693
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,530
I ain't.

1694
01:50:32,562 --> 01:50:33,794
Then why is you crying?

1695
01:50:35,202 --> 01:50:36,615
You scaring me.

1696
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:38,439
Why is I'm scaring you?

1697
01:50:39,542 --> 01:50:40,760
Because you scary.

1698
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,724
To speak German
this afternoon with Hilda

1699
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:48,453
was positively soul-enriching.

1700
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:51,238
Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.

1701
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:54,602
You stay right here.

1702
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:02,418
You indicated earlier,

1703
01:51:02,928 --> 01:51:05,127
you'd be willing to part with Hilda.

1704
01:51:05,404 --> 01:51:07,757
Why, yes. Yessiree bob, I did.

1705
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:11,342
In that case,

1706
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:13,369
allow me...

1707
01:51:13,973 --> 01:51:15,785
to propose another proposition.

1708
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,220
I'm all ears.

1709
01:51:17,455 --> 01:51:19,165
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1710
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:21,490
Monsieur Candie...
Stephen!

1711
01:51:22,716 --> 01:51:24,633
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1712
01:51:26,139 --> 01:51:28,379
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1713
01:51:28,736 --> 01:51:31,144
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1714
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:32,437
Excuse him.

1715
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:35,425
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1716
01:51:36,734 --> 01:51:38,443
You mean get up out of my chair?

1717
01:51:38,819 --> 01:51:40,691
If'n you could manage it.

1718
01:51:40,974 --> 01:51:41,703
Why?

1719
01:51:42,344 --> 01:51:44,055
It's about dessert.

1720
01:51:44,056 --> 01:51:45,367
What about dessert?

1721
01:51:46,184 --> 01:51:48,599
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1722
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,711
We're having white cake!

1723
01:51:51,234 --> 01:51:53,446
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1724
01:51:53,893 --> 01:51:57,595
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1725
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,756
Meet me in the library.

1726
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:03,278
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1727
01:52:03,286 --> 01:52:05,166
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1728
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:07,311
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I...

1729
01:52:08,311 --> 01:52:09,988
I will be along momentarily.

1730
01:52:10,392 --> 01:52:11,296
Yes sir.

1731
01:52:12,586 --> 01:52:13,403
Well,

1732
01:52:14,439 --> 01:52:15,427
gentlemen,

1733
01:52:15,835 --> 01:52:18,402
as you can see talented as
they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,

1734
01:52:18,436 --> 01:52:19,506
from time to time,

1735
01:52:20,163 --> 01:52:22,177
adult supervision is required.

1736
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,431
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1737
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,624
You may clear the dinner service.

1738
01:52:36,165 --> 01:52:37,666
You heard him. Go on! Get.

1739
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:39,993
Hurry up, girl.

1740
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:41,047
So, Dr. Schultz,

1741
01:52:42,031 --> 01:52:44,574
why don't you regale us
with a tale of the circus.

1742
01:52:45,564 --> 01:52:47,008
The circus?

1743
01:52:54,469 --> 01:52:55,772
What is the matter?

1744
01:53:01,628 --> 01:53:06,129
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1745
01:53:06,886 --> 01:53:08,205
They wants that girl.

1746
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,358
Stephen,

1747
01:53:11,529 --> 01:53:12,841
what the hell are you talking about?

1748
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:15,200
They playing your ass for a fool

1749
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:16,582
is what I'm talking about.

1750
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:18,137
They ain't here,

1751
01:53:18,813 --> 01:53:20,295
for no musclebound Jimmie.

1752
01:53:21,123 --> 01:53:22,415
They here for that girl.

1753
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:24,354
Wh... What girl?

1754
01:53:24,356 --> 01:53:25,425
Wha... Hilda?

1755
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:26,685
Yeah, Hilda.

1756
01:53:26,849 --> 01:53:27,784
Her and Django,

1757
01:53:28,142 --> 01:53:29,404
them niggers know each other.

1758
01:53:31,157 --> 01:53:33,075
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1759
01:53:33,077 --> 01:53:34,231
Did he give you any money?

1760
01:53:34,232 --> 01:53:35,302
No! Not yet. But...

1761
01:53:35,304 --> 01:53:36,823
Then he ain't bought diddly.

1762
01:53:36,824 --> 01:53:37,765
Not yet, no how.

1763
01:53:38,134 --> 01:53:40,106
But he's just about to buy...

1764
01:53:40,492 --> 01:53:43,094
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1765
01:53:43,987 --> 01:53:45,045
Thank you, Stephen.

1766
01:53:45,436 --> 01:53:46,668
You're welcome, Calvin.

1767
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
Where you getting all this?

1768
01:53:55,438 --> 01:53:58,772
Why would they go through all that
trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back,

1769
01:53:58,773 --> 01:54:00,199
ain't worth $300?

1770
01:54:00,355 --> 01:54:03,757
They doing it because that nigger
Django's in love with Hilda.

1771
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:05,747
She probably his wife.

1772
01:54:06,454 --> 01:54:10,389
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with,

1773
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:12,177
I'm sure I don't know.

1774
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,603
If she's who they want...

1775
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:18,843
why this whole...

1776
01:54:19,128 --> 01:54:21,773
snake oil pitch about
Mandingos, then?

1777
01:54:22,065 --> 01:54:25,094
You would not pay
no never mind to no $300.

1778
01:54:25,893 --> 01:54:27,573
But that 12,000?

1779
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:30,648
That made you real friendly,
now, didn't it?

1780
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,173
Yes, it did.

1781
01:54:38,954 --> 01:54:40,018
His wife?

1782
01:54:44,703 --> 01:54:46,205
If it had been a snake,

1783
01:54:46,987 --> 01:54:48,231
it would have bit me.

1784
01:54:51,653 --> 01:54:53,325
Those lying...

1785
01:54:54,364 --> 01:54:56,411
goddamn time...

1786
01:54:56,682 --> 01:54:59,916
wasting sons of bitches.

1787
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:03,523
Sons of bitches!

1788
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:05,126
Out of New Orleans,

1789
01:55:05,127 --> 01:55:08,723
so I have quite a bit of practice
with theater types.

1790
01:55:10,309 --> 01:55:11,449
Oh, there you are.

1791
01:55:12,049 --> 01:55:14,843
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1792
01:55:16,529 --> 01:55:18,479
That'd be a hell of a note, would not it?

1793
01:55:19,357 --> 01:55:20,115
Lara Lee,

1794
01:55:20,491 --> 01:55:22,146
I was just looking out the big window.

1795
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:24,152
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some...

1796
01:55:24,348 --> 01:55:25,341
shady slaver

1797
01:55:25,343 --> 01:55:26,772
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1798
01:55:26,774 --> 01:55:29,672
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball?

1799
01:55:30,672 --> 01:55:31,942
Of course, brother.

1800
01:55:31,943 --> 01:55:32,924
Thank you, darling.

1801
01:55:45,875 --> 01:55:47,023
Yeah.

1802
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:48,877
Business never sleeps.

1803
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:52,734
Apropos,

1804
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,878
before your exit,

1805
01:55:55,097 --> 01:55:59,189
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1806
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:00,085
Ah yes.

1807
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:01,766
Yes, we were, doctor.

1808
01:56:02,224 --> 01:56:04,351
And we will again. In a moment.

1809
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:22,418
Who's your little friend?

1810
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:28,987
This is Ben.

1811
01:56:30,734 --> 01:56:32,262
He's a old Joe that...

1812
01:56:32,743 --> 01:56:34,894
lived around here for a long time.

1813
01:56:35,841 --> 01:56:37,634
And I do mean a long damn time.

1814
01:56:39,526 --> 01:56:40,659
Old Ben here,

1815
01:56:41,358 --> 01:56:42,910
took care of my daddy...

1816
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,504
and my daddy's daddy.

1817
01:56:46,286 --> 01:56:48,455
Till he up and keeled over one day.

1818
01:56:51,506 --> 01:56:53,174
Old Ben took care of me.

1819
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,366
Growing up the son of a...

1820
01:56:57,601 --> 01:57:00,006
a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1821
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:03,517
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta...

1822
01:57:04,358 --> 01:57:05,580
black faces.

1823
01:57:07,495 --> 01:57:09,106
I spent my whole life here,

1824
01:57:09,606 --> 01:57:10,562
right here,

1825
01:57:11,226 --> 01:57:12,321
in Candyland,

1826
01:57:13,945 --> 01:57:15,052
surrounded,

1827
01:57:15,826 --> 01:57:17,505
by black faces.

1828
01:57:19,786 --> 01:57:22,574
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1829
01:57:23,424 --> 01:57:25,129
I only had one question.

1830
01:57:29,274 --> 01:57:30,369
Why don't they kill us?

1831
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:36,707
Now, right out there on that porch,

1832
01:57:37,343 --> 01:57:39,491
three times a week for 50 years,

1833
01:57:39,999 --> 01:57:41,182
Old Ben here,

1834
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:44,120
would shave my daddy
with a straight razor.

1835
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:45,930
Now,

1836
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:47,293
if I was Old Ben,

1837
01:57:47,625 --> 01:57:50,216
I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1838
01:57:50,439 --> 01:57:53,590
and it would not have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1839
01:57:56,411 --> 01:57:57,517
But he never did.

1840
01:57:59,735 --> 01:58:00,683
Why not?

1841
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:03,041
You see,

1842
01:58:03,946 --> 01:58:05,996
the science of phrenology

1843
01:58:07,165 --> 01:58:09,041
is crucial to understanding

1844
01:58:09,634 --> 01:58:12,253
the separation of our two species.

1845
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:16,478
In the skull of the African here,

1846
01:58:18,092 --> 01:58:20,496
the area associated
with submissiveness,

1847
01:58:20,636 --> 01:58:22,563
is larger than any human or

1848
01:58:22,564 --> 01:58:25,767
any other subhuman
species on planet Earth.

1849
01:58:41,769 --> 01:58:43,054
If you examine...

1850
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,788
this piece of skull here...

1851
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:54,198
you will notice,

1852
01:58:54,566 --> 01:58:57,039
three distinct dimples.

1853
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:01,194
Here,

1854
01:59:01,934 --> 01:59:02,641
here,

1855
01:59:03,078 --> 01:59:03,858
and here.

1856
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:05,007
Now...

1857
01:59:05,653 --> 01:59:07,588
if I was holding the skull of an

1858
01:59:07,983 --> 01:59:10,298
Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1859
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,796
these three dimples would be found in
the area of the skull most associated with...

1860
01:59:15,511 --> 01:59:16,543
creativity.

1861
01:59:17,549 --> 01:59:18,940
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1862
01:59:20,126 --> 01:59:21,676
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1863
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,035
unburdened by genius,

1864
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:28,650
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1865
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:30,974
servility.

1866
01:59:32,588 --> 01:59:33,595
Now, Bright Boy.

1867
01:59:34,919 --> 01:59:36,845
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1868
01:59:39,799 --> 01:59:41,623
But if I took this hammer here...

1869
01:59:44,018 --> 01:59:45,955
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1870
01:59:47,402 --> 01:59:49,689
you would have the same three dimples,

1871
01:59:50,478 --> 01:59:52,227
in the same place,

1872
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:54,921
as Old Ben.

1873
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,611
Hey!

1874
01:59:57,752 --> 01:59:59,889
Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!

1875
02:00:00,274 --> 02:00:03,231
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1876
02:00:03,389 --> 02:00:05,955
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1877
02:00:07,878 --> 02:00:10,951
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1878
02:00:11,097 --> 02:00:12,624
but that you can believe!

1879
02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:14,595
Mr. Moguy,

1880
02:00:15,004 --> 02:00:16,619
would you be so kind
as to collect the pistol

1881
02:00:16,621 --> 02:00:18,119
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1882
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:24,897
Thank you ever so much.

1883
02:00:25,077 --> 02:00:25,894
Doctor.

1884
02:00:30,604 --> 02:00:31,496
Where were we?

1885
02:00:36,365 --> 02:00:37,539
Jackass.

1886
02:00:41,686 --> 02:00:42,675
Ah yes.

1887
02:00:43,556 --> 02:00:44,592
I do believe,

1888
02:00:44,757 --> 02:00:46,154
you were just getting ready to make me,

1889
02:00:46,173 --> 02:00:48,104
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1890
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:49,815
Am I right?

1891
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:55,056
Right.

1892
02:00:58,075 --> 02:00:59,018
Bring out Hilda!

1893
02:01:02,344 --> 02:01:03,588
Get over there yonder.

1894
02:01:05,176 --> 02:01:07,428
Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1895
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,995
Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.

1896
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:10,390
Now shut your mouth!

1897
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:15,870
Dr. Schultz,

1898
02:01:16,444 --> 02:01:17,438
in Greenville,

1899
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:19,036
you yourself said,

1900
02:01:19,442 --> 02:01:20,584
that for the right nigger,

1901
02:01:20,586 --> 02:01:24,509
you'd be willing to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1902
02:01:25,312 --> 02:01:26,540
To which me myself said,

1903
02:01:26,845 --> 02:01:28,578
What is your definition of ridiculous?

1904
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:29,621
To which you said,

1905
02:01:30,261 --> 02:01:32,203
$12,000.

1906
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:34,334
Now considering,

1907
02:01:34,501 --> 02:01:36,874
you all have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1908
02:01:37,204 --> 02:01:38,618
went through a whole lot of trouble,

1909
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:41,380
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1910
02:01:41,435 --> 02:01:43,754
to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1911
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:45,769
it would appear that Broomhilda,

1912
02:01:45,871 --> 02:01:46,931
is in fact,

1913
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:49,089
the right nigger.

1914
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:52,826
And if you all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1915
02:01:54,075 --> 02:01:55,349
the price...

1916
02:01:55,931 --> 02:01:59,273
is $12,000.

1917
02:01:59,801 --> 02:02:03,602
And I take it you prefer the take it
or leave it style of negotiation?

1918
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:06,927
Yes, I do doctor.

1919
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:10,589
You see, under the laws
of Chickasaw County,

1920
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,522
Broomhilda here,

1921
02:02:12,795 --> 02:02:14,185
is my property.

1922
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,866
And I can choose to do,

1923
02:02:16,999 --> 02:02:18,233
with my property,

1924
02:02:18,348 --> 02:02:19,982
whatever I so desire!

1925
02:02:21,252 --> 02:02:23,328
And if you all think my price...

1926
02:02:24,388 --> 02:02:25,958
for this nigger here,

1927
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,088
is too steep...

1928
02:02:28,104 --> 02:02:30,347
what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1929
02:02:34,572 --> 02:02:36,242
take this goddamn hammer here,

1930
02:02:36,243 --> 02:02:37,789
and beat her ass to death with it!

1931
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:40,242
Right in front of both you all!
Easy, big fella.

1932
02:02:40,244 --> 02:02:42,448
Then we can examine the three dimples

1933
02:02:42,661 --> 02:02:44,442
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1934
02:02:44,875 --> 02:02:45,816
Now,

1935
02:02:46,273 --> 02:02:47,716
what's it gonna be, doc?

1936
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:50,687
What's it gonna be?

1937
02:02:50,689 --> 02:02:54,064
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1938
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,727
Yes, you may.

1939
02:03:10,579 --> 02:03:11,954
That 12.

1940
02:03:15,624 --> 02:03:17,051
Sold!

1941
02:03:18,214 --> 02:03:20,744
To the man with the exceptional beard

1942
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:23,904
and his unexceptional nigger.

1943
02:03:29,975 --> 02:03:31,822
Mr. Moguy.
Yes, Calvin?

1944
02:03:32,978 --> 02:03:36,104
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt
for $12,000, please?

1945
02:03:36,313 --> 02:03:37,788
$12,000.

1946
02:03:41,272 --> 02:03:43,394
It was a pleasure doing business
with you all.

1947
02:03:44,043 --> 02:03:45,156
Now gentlemen,

1948
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,881
if you care to join me in the parlor...

1949
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,987
we will be serving white cake.

1950
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,902
Well done, Calvin.

1951
02:05:24,490 --> 02:05:25,341
Excuse me.

1952
02:05:26,169 --> 02:05:27,357
Excuse me, ma'am?

1953
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:30,668
Could you please stop
playing Beethoven?

1954
02:05:31,254 --> 02:05:32,912
Take your hands off the harp!

1955
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,919
Doctor!

1956
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:40,889
Doctor, you can't go in there!
Stephen.

1957
02:05:40,932 --> 02:05:42,210
Stephen.
He ain't got no business going in there.

1958
02:05:42,226 --> 02:05:43,054
Let it be.

1959
02:05:43,788 --> 02:05:45,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1960
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:47,158
I'll handle this.

1961
02:06:13,188 --> 02:06:14,118
White cake?

1962
02:06:15,356 --> 02:06:17,387
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1963
02:06:27,623 --> 02:06:29,905
You brooding about me
getting the best of you?

1964
02:06:31,153 --> 02:06:35,566
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1965
02:06:35,994 --> 02:06:37,111
D'Artagnan.

1966
02:06:38,693 --> 02:06:41,451
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1967
02:06:42,655 --> 02:06:43,537
Come again?

1968
02:06:47,297 --> 02:06:48,706
Alexandre Dumas.

1969
02:06:48,707 --> 02:06:50,772
He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1970
02:06:51,556 --> 02:06:52,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1971
02:06:53,188 --> 02:06:55,075
I figured you must be an admirer.

1972
02:06:55,115 --> 02:06:56,343
You named your slave,

1973
02:06:56,344 --> 02:06:58,581
after his novel's lead character.

1974
02:06:59,738 --> 02:07:03,322
Now if, Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1975
02:07:03,324 --> 02:07:05,075
I wonder what he would have made of it.

1976
02:07:07,563 --> 02:07:08,950
You doubt he'd approve?

1977
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,209
Yes.

1978
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:16,144
His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1979
02:07:18,903 --> 02:07:20,291
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1980
02:07:22,581 --> 02:07:24,364
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1981
02:07:28,684 --> 02:07:30,501
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1982
02:07:30,667 --> 02:07:31,528
Yes, they are.

1983
02:07:31,559 --> 02:07:32,375
May I?

1984
02:07:32,493 --> 02:07:33,344
Of course.

1985
02:07:33,472 --> 02:07:34,237
Thank you.

1986
02:07:37,096 --> 02:07:40,104
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1987
02:07:40,106 --> 02:07:42,031
and of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1988
02:07:42,462 --> 02:07:44,598
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1989
02:07:45,869 --> 02:07:48,230
Right over there on that little table.
Thank you.

1990
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,004
Thank you.

1991
02:08:14,977 --> 02:08:16,713
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1992
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:21,315
consider yourself a free woman.

1993
02:08:33,766 --> 02:08:35,336
Mr. Candie...

1994
02:08:37,461 --> 02:08:38,567
normally,

1995
02:08:39,387 --> 02:08:41,118
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1996
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:45,886
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is till I see you again

1997
02:08:46,536 --> 02:08:48,716
and since I never wish
to see you again,

1998
02:08:48,717 --> 02:08:49,795
to you sir,

1999
02:08:50,483 --> 02:08:52,859
I say, goodbye.

2000
02:08:57,106 --> 02:08:58,019
Let's go.

2001
02:08:59,412 --> 02:09:00,501
Come on.

2002
02:09:03,095 --> 02:09:04,720
One more moment, doctor!

2003
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:07,716
What?

2004
02:09:12,504 --> 02:09:14,456
It's a custom here in the South,

2005
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:18,499
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties,

2006
02:09:19,124 --> 02:09:20,118
shake hands.

2007
02:09:21,482 --> 02:09:22,884
It implies good faith.

2008
02:09:23,644 --> 02:09:25,873
I'm not from the South.
But you are...

2009
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,205
in my house, doctor.

2010
02:09:29,928 --> 02:09:31,491
So I'm afraid I must insist.

2011
02:09:31,762 --> 02:09:32,574
Insist?

2012
02:09:33,027 --> 02:09:33,806
On what?

2013
02:09:34,278 --> 02:09:35,234
That I shake your hand?

2014
02:09:35,236 --> 02:09:38,531
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist
in the opposite direction.

2015
02:09:39,134 --> 02:09:40,582
You know what I think you are?

2016
02:09:40,903 --> 02:09:42,262
What you think I am?

2017
02:09:42,264 --> 02:09:43,588
No, I don't.

2018
02:09:45,571 --> 02:09:47,498
I think you are a bad loser.

2019
02:09:48,049 --> 02:09:50,784
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

2020
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:52,453
Nevertheless,

2021
02:09:53,117 --> 02:09:55,914
here in Chickasaw
County a deal, ain't done...

2022
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:58,784
until the two parties have shook hands.

2023
02:09:59,593 --> 02:10:02,429
Even after all that paper signing,
don't mean shit...

2024
02:10:03,496 --> 02:10:04,465
you...

2025
02:10:05,008 --> 02:10:06,498
don't shake my hand.

2026
02:10:07,936 --> 02:10:10,794
If I don't shake your hand,

2027
02:10:11,266 --> 02:10:13,328
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

2028
02:10:13,932 --> 02:10:15,195
I don't think so.

2029
02:10:16,926 --> 02:10:17,904
Mr. Pooch?

2030
02:10:19,837 --> 02:10:23,637
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

2031
02:10:24,615 --> 02:10:25,843
you cut her ass down.

2032
02:10:48,403 --> 02:10:51,181
You really want me
to shake your hand?

2033
02:10:53,251 --> 02:10:54,567
I insist.

2034
02:10:56,133 --> 02:10:57,911
If you insist.

2035
02:11:15,336 --> 02:11:18,038
No! Calvin!

2036
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:21,166
Calvin!

2037
02:11:27,047 --> 02:11:27,972
I'm sorry.

2038
02:11:28,355 --> 02:11:29,604
I couldn't resist.

2039
02:11:41,812 --> 02:11:43,824
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

2040
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:45,980
Help, he's killing everyone!

2041
02:12:03,093 --> 02:12:03,975
Holy!

2042
02:12:04,738 --> 02:12:06,598
Shit! Son of a bitch!

2043
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:11,883
Damn it! Fucking!

2044
02:12:12,437 --> 02:12:13,302
Get the...

2045
02:12:16,458 --> 02:12:18,151
Damn it, son of a bitch!

2046
02:12:18,254 --> 02:12:19,321
What? Fucking...

2047
02:12:19,725 --> 02:12:21,176
Goddamn it!

2048
02:12:22,613 --> 02:12:25,082
What the fuck is going on?

2049
02:12:26,037 --> 02:12:27,333
You shot me!

2050
02:12:27,437 --> 02:12:30,184
You stupid son of a bitch!
Sorry, Jessie!

2051
02:12:30,764 --> 02:12:34,656
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

2052
02:13:04,858 --> 02:13:05,595
Aim low!

2053
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:09,983
Nigger! Gonna kill!

2054
02:13:10,979 --> 02:13:12,299
Oh God!

2055
02:13:12,455 --> 02:13:13,276
Oh, my God!

2056
02:13:14,551 --> 02:13:15,837
Motherfucker!

2057
02:13:24,482 --> 02:13:25,177
Shit!

2058
02:14:22,456 --> 02:14:22,992
Shit.

2059
02:14:35,485 --> 02:14:36,903
Hold your fire!

2060
02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,825
Hold your fire!

2061
02:14:43,744 --> 02:14:45,503
Stop shooting, goddamn it!

2062
02:14:54,515 --> 02:14:55,561
Django!

2063
02:14:56,438 --> 02:14:57,269
What?

2064
02:15:00,533 --> 02:15:01,843
We got your woman!

2065
02:15:03,593 --> 02:15:06,491
Billy Crash here
got his pistol upside her head.

2066
02:15:07,117 --> 02:15:09,003
You don't stop all that carrying on,

2067
02:15:09,305 --> 02:15:11,390
he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

2068
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:13,779
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.

2069
02:15:14,736 --> 02:15:15,937
That there is a promise.

2070
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,527
Or...

2071
02:15:19,231 --> 02:15:20,305
you can give up,

2072
02:15:20,766 --> 02:15:22,017
throw your gun out...

2073
02:15:23,266 --> 02:15:24,445
we won't kill Hilda.

2074
02:15:24,619 --> 02:15:25,608
Horseshit!

2075
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:28,955
Honest lnjun, Django.
I swear before God.

2076
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:31,431
You give up,

2077
02:15:32,377 --> 02:15:34,703
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

2078
02:15:36,537 --> 02:15:38,475
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

2079
02:15:38,965 --> 02:15:42,031
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

2080
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:45,258
I believe if you don't give up
in the next ten seconds,

2081
02:15:45,289 --> 02:15:47,116
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!

2082
02:15:47,374 --> 02:15:48,791
Believe that!

2083
02:15:51,186 --> 02:15:52,439
Don't do it.

2084
02:15:53,406 --> 02:15:54,620
You give me up.

2085
02:15:55,006 --> 02:15:56,855
Six!
Just let me go.

2086
02:15:57,186 --> 02:15:58,730
Seven!
They got too much.

2087
02:15:58,961 --> 02:16:00,308
Django.
Eight!

2088
02:16:00,767 --> 02:16:01,788
I love you.

2089
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:03,158
Nine!

2090
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,290
Hold it!

2091
02:16:04,658 --> 02:16:05,429
No.

2092
02:16:07,466 --> 02:16:08,321
I give up.

2093
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:11,885
I can't hear you, nigger.

2094
02:16:12,689 --> 02:16:14,543
I said, I give up!

2095
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:39,287
No!

2096
02:16:42,272 --> 02:16:42,967
No!

2097
02:18:15,108 --> 02:18:17,165
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

2098
02:18:22,586 --> 02:18:24,150
So you all bounty hunters?

2099
02:18:25,548 --> 02:18:28,047
I knew there was something
fishy about you all.

2100
02:18:29,513 --> 02:18:31,251
We found your wanted posters...

2101
02:18:32,097 --> 02:18:34,031
and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

2102
02:18:36,006 --> 02:18:37,227
I got to say...

2103
02:18:38,416 --> 02:18:40,929
I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

2104
02:18:41,655 --> 02:18:44,699
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

2105
02:18:45,782 --> 02:18:47,963
Probably pretty good while it lasted?

2106
02:18:58,191 --> 02:18:59,975
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

2107
02:19:00,554 --> 02:19:01,437
On three.

2108
02:19:01,733 --> 02:19:02,542
One.

2109
02:19:03,996 --> 02:19:04,874
I got you.

2110
02:19:05,367 --> 02:19:06,022
Two.

2111
02:19:07,114 --> 02:19:09,042
Calm down, now, here it comes.

2112
02:19:09,894 --> 02:19:10,918
Captain?

2113
02:19:11,884 --> 02:19:13,359
Miss Lara want to see you.

2114
02:19:14,736 --> 02:19:17,501
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

2115
02:19:18,747 --> 02:19:22,057
Oh, and she changed her mind
about snipping Django.

2116
02:19:23,334 --> 02:19:25,930
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

2117
02:19:27,917 --> 02:19:29,922
Well, she didn't waste
a minute telling me.

2118
02:19:37,123 --> 02:19:38,594
How disappointing.

2119
02:20:01,937 --> 02:20:02,859
You leaving.

2120
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:06,201
This here,

2121
02:20:06,741 --> 02:20:07,898
what you take with you.

2122
02:20:11,463 --> 02:20:15,229
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

2123
02:20:15,231 --> 02:20:17,645
could talk about for the last few hours.

2124
02:20:18,676 --> 02:20:22,498
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

2125
02:20:22,522 --> 02:20:25,001
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

2126
02:20:25,290 --> 02:20:30,070
Now mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fucking with your fun parts.

2127
02:20:30,888 --> 02:20:31,597
Now,

2128
02:20:31,661 --> 02:20:32,923
that may seem,

2129
02:20:33,119 --> 02:20:34,527
like a good idea,

2130
02:20:34,785 --> 02:20:36,004
but truth is,

2131
02:20:37,876 --> 02:20:40,403
when you snip a nigger's nuts,

2132
02:20:40,427 --> 02:20:42,484
most of them bleed out in, oh, about...

2133
02:20:43,696 --> 02:20:44,560
seven minutes.

2134
02:20:44,562 --> 02:20:45,518
Most of them.

2135
02:20:46,356 --> 02:20:47,070
Well,

2136
02:20:48,331 --> 02:20:49,526
more than most.

2137
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:51,652
Then I says.

2138
02:20:53,444 --> 02:20:55,052
Shitfire.

2139
02:20:56,421 --> 02:20:58,720
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey

2140
02:20:58,721 --> 02:21:00,286
got it worse than that.

2141
02:21:01,463 --> 02:21:02,822
And they still saying.

2142
02:21:02,823 --> 02:21:04,263
Let's whip him to death.

2143
02:21:04,482 --> 02:21:07,502
Or Throw him to the Mandingos.
Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.

2144
02:21:07,827 --> 02:21:08,782
And I said.

2145
02:21:09,001 --> 02:21:10,880
What's so special about that?

2146
02:21:11,306 --> 02:21:13,174
We do that shit all the time.

2147
02:21:13,404 --> 02:21:14,535
Hell's bells.

2148
02:21:14,536 --> 02:21:17,310
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey,

2149
02:21:17,732 --> 02:21:19,361
got it worse than that.

2150
02:21:20,604 --> 02:21:22,848
Lo and behold,

2151
02:21:23,389 --> 02:21:24,716
out of nowhere,

2152
02:21:24,717 --> 02:21:27,369
Miss Lara come up with the bright idea,

2153
02:21:28,387 --> 02:21:31,531
of giving your ass to
the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

2154
02:21:34,419 --> 02:21:35,628
And as a slave,

2155
02:21:36,418 --> 02:21:38,495
of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

2156
02:21:39,571 --> 02:21:40,623
henceforth,

2157
02:21:41,104 --> 02:21:42,512
till the day you die,

2158
02:21:43,297 --> 02:21:45,821
all day, every day,

2159
02:21:46,547 --> 02:21:48,603
you will be swinging a sledgehammer,

2160
02:21:49,535 --> 02:21:51,126
turning big rocks,

2161
02:21:51,833 --> 02:21:53,264
into little rocks.

2162
02:21:54,606 --> 02:21:55,740
Now, when you get there,

2163
02:21:56,314 --> 02:21:58,237
they gonna take away your name,

2164
02:21:59,094 --> 02:22:00,245
give you a number,

2165
02:22:00,246 --> 02:22:01,597
and a sledgehammer,

2166
02:22:02,214 --> 02:22:03,942
and say, get to work!

2167
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:07,285
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

2168
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:09,366
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

2169
02:22:09,854 --> 02:22:12,545
They does that real good.

2170
02:22:13,619 --> 02:22:14,775
They gonna work ya.

2171
02:22:15,429 --> 02:22:17,625
All day, every day,

2172
02:22:18,331 --> 02:22:19,600
till your back give out.

2173
02:22:20,623 --> 02:22:23,036
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

2174
02:22:23,203 --> 02:22:24,987
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

2175
02:22:26,109 --> 02:22:27,169
And that...

2176
02:22:27,789 --> 02:22:30,937
will be the story of you, Django.

2177
02:23:10,208 --> 02:23:12,402
And what's the golden rule, Frankie?

2178
02:23:12,835 --> 02:23:14,705
You don't root abos.

2179
02:23:19,717 --> 02:23:21,009
Hey, white boy.

2180
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,299
I said, hey, white boy.

2181
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:26,747
Shut up, black.

2182
02:23:26,748 --> 02:23:28,142
You ain't got nothing
to say I want to hear.

2183
02:23:28,184 --> 02:23:30,240
How'd you like to make $11,000?

2184
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,776
Do what, now?

2185
02:23:32,253 --> 02:23:35,095
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?

2186
02:23:35,938 --> 02:23:38,067
$11,500, actually.

2187
02:23:38,477 --> 02:23:40,029
What the fuck are you talking about?

2188
02:23:40,511 --> 02:23:42,249
Back there at that plantation, Candyland,

2189
02:23:42,846 --> 02:23:45,315
there was an $11,500 fortune,

2190
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:46,399
just sitting there.

2191
02:23:46,572 --> 02:23:47,959
And you all rode right past it.

2192
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:50,668
You be damned blackie,
we're not bandits.

2193
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:51,748
I ain't saying that.

2194
02:23:51,832 --> 02:23:53,311
Nice thing about this fortune,

2195
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:54,874
is it ain't illegal.

2196
02:23:55,307 --> 02:23:56,370
You can't steal it.

2197
02:23:57,076 --> 02:23:58,366
You got to earn it, white boy.

2198
02:23:59,463 --> 02:24:01,301
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

2199
02:24:01,679 --> 02:24:03,532
The $11,500 fortune

2200
02:24:03,533 --> 02:24:04,900
waiting for you back at Candyland

2201
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:07,303
is in the form of a
Wanted Dead or Alive bounty

2202
02:24:07,476 --> 02:24:09,696
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

2203
02:24:09,829 --> 02:24:11,496
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

2204
02:24:11,498 --> 02:24:14,714
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

2205
02:24:15,081 --> 02:24:16,316
the Bacall Gang.

2206
02:24:16,685 --> 02:24:19,736
There's a seven thousand dollars
Wanted Dead or Alive bounty on him,

2207
02:24:20,066 --> 02:24:22,886
One thousand five hundred dollars
for each of his three accomplices.

2208
02:24:23,618 --> 02:24:24,678
Dandy Michaels,

2209
02:24:25,345 --> 02:24:26,526
Gerald Nash,

2210
02:24:26,969 --> 02:24:28,930
and Crazy Craig Koons.

2211
02:24:29,704 --> 02:24:31,122
Now all four of them gentlemen,

2212
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:32,589
they back there at Candyland,

2213
02:24:32,817 --> 02:24:34,518
laughing their ass off.
You know why?

2214
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:36,836
Because they just
got away with murder.

2215
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:38,963
But it ain't got to be that way.

2216
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:40,150
You and your mates,

2217
02:24:40,478 --> 02:24:42,425
you all can ride back there and
you all can go get that money.

2218
02:24:42,717 --> 02:24:43,877
What'd these jokers do again?

2219
02:24:44,088 --> 02:24:46,737
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

2220
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:48,811
Stagecoach robbery.

2221
02:24:49,053 --> 02:24:50,273
Innocent white people.

2222
02:24:51,851 --> 02:24:54,854
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

2223
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:56,056
Get it out.

2224
02:24:58,241 --> 02:25:00,038
Wanted. Dead or alive.

2225
02:25:00,431 --> 02:25:03,406
Smitty Bacall
and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

2226
02:25:03,515 --> 02:25:04,783
But you're a slave.
For murder...

2227
02:25:04,864 --> 02:25:07,583
I ain't no goddamn slave.
And stagecoach robbery.

2228
02:25:07,738 --> 02:25:09,108
Do I sound like a fucking slave?

2229
02:25:09,118 --> 02:25:10,749
$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.

2230
02:25:10,994 --> 02:25:12,902
That's a shitload.
I'm a bounty hunter.

2231
02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:15,951
Yesterday,

2232
02:25:16,276 --> 02:25:17,367
as a free man,

2233
02:25:17,924 --> 02:25:20,421
I rode into Candyland on a horse,

2234
02:25:20,422 --> 02:25:22,256
with my German white partner,

2235
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,853
Dr. King Schultz.

2236
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:27,385
We tracked the Bacall
Gang all the way from Texas,

2237
02:25:27,386 --> 02:25:28,888
to Chickasaw County.

2238
02:25:29,223 --> 02:25:31,974
We finally found their ass
laying low in Candyland.

2239
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:33,547
We went in there to get them,

2240
02:25:34,043 --> 02:25:35,243
things went sour,

2241
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:37,057
my partner got killed,

2242
02:25:37,575 --> 02:25:38,992
Calvin Candie got shot,

2243
02:25:39,393 --> 02:25:41,521
then everybody there
decided to blame me,

2244
02:25:42,045 --> 02:25:43,105
so here I am.

2245
02:25:45,644 --> 02:25:47,362
But you all know
I ain't on that manifest.

2246
02:25:47,772 --> 02:25:50,099
And all you all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

2247
02:25:50,688 --> 02:25:52,425
But them four men is still back there,

2248
02:25:52,654 --> 02:25:53,689
they're still wanted,

2249
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,399
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

2250
02:25:57,538 --> 02:25:59,470
is you all riding back in there
and getting it.

2251
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,195
What's the deal?

2252
02:26:02,007 --> 02:26:04,158
You tell us who they are and we...

2253
02:26:05,069 --> 02:26:06,489
turn you loose?
No, no, no, no.

2254
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:08,000
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

2255
02:26:08,727 --> 02:26:10,173
But, you give me a pistol,

2256
02:26:10,856 --> 02:26:12,014
one of them horses,

2257
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:14,961
and $500 of that 11,500,

2258
02:26:15,507 --> 02:26:16,686
and I'll point them out to you.

2259
02:26:17,024 --> 02:26:18,509
This is a real handbill.

2260
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:20,182
Now just because it's a real handbill

2261
02:26:20,184 --> 02:26:22,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

2262
02:26:22,482 --> 02:26:23,684
Now why,

2263
02:26:23,685 --> 02:26:27,019
would a slave have a
Wanted Dead or Alive handbill

2264
02:26:27,266 --> 02:26:28,545
in his pocket?

2265
02:26:33,107 --> 02:26:35,901
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

2266
02:26:42,248 --> 02:26:43,324
Alright,

2267
02:26:44,082 --> 02:26:45,775
I'm gonna ask you again.

2268
02:26:47,519 --> 02:26:49,886
I want you to remember, I don't like liars.

2269
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:52,554
Is he a Candyland slave,

2270
02:26:52,597 --> 02:26:56,094
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

2271
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,333
Yeah.

2272
02:26:58,676 --> 02:27:00,833
They walked us from
the Greenville auction,

2273
02:27:00,888 --> 02:27:02,754
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

2274
02:27:03,608 --> 02:27:05,255
Now this white man,

2275
02:27:06,109 --> 02:27:07,715
was the black his slave?

2276
02:27:08,173 --> 02:27:09,447
He weren't no slave.

2277
02:27:10,064 --> 02:27:11,912
You fucking sure about that?

2278
02:27:11,913 --> 02:27:13,047
Damn sure.

2279
02:27:17,413 --> 02:27:19,543
What happened over in Candyland?

2280
02:27:19,544 --> 02:27:20,763
Bunch a shooting.

2281
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:22,322
Massa got shot.

2282
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:24,159
Who shot him?

2283
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:25,058
The German.

2284
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:26,453
Why'd he do that?

2285
02:27:27,211 --> 02:27:29,859
Nigger and the German was acting
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

2286
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,139
Well, what were they?

2287
02:27:32,746 --> 02:27:34,006
Bounty hunters.

2288
02:27:35,177 --> 02:27:37,871
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

2289
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:40,722
Well, smoke,

2290
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:42,480
you got a deal.

2291
02:27:44,152 --> 02:27:45,413
I got one more condition.

2292
02:27:46,277 --> 02:27:46,926
What's that?

2293
02:27:47,151 --> 02:27:48,157
When we get there,

2294
02:27:48,759 --> 02:27:49,914
when time come...

2295
02:27:52,369 --> 02:27:53,685
you let me help you kill them.

2296
02:27:53,686 --> 02:27:54,417
Hey...

2297
02:27:55,463 --> 02:27:56,689
you're a funny bugger.

2298
02:27:57,215 --> 02:27:59,184
Cut him loose.
Yeah, yeah.

2299
02:27:59,664 --> 02:28:01,457
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

2300
02:28:01,954 --> 02:28:03,418
You got yourself a deal, mate.

2301
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:04,642
Hey!

2302
02:28:05,836 --> 02:28:07,566
You're alright for a black fella.

2303
02:28:07,595 --> 02:28:08,345
Oh, yeah.

2304
02:28:13,803 --> 02:28:15,732
There we go.
There you go, mate.

2305
02:28:15,803 --> 02:28:16,621
Yeah.

2306
02:28:17,374 --> 02:28:19,850
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

2307
02:28:20,017 --> 02:28:21,517
What them saddlebags got in them?

2308
02:28:22,273 --> 02:28:23,331
Dynamite.

2309
02:28:23,497 --> 02:28:25,805
No. I ain't riding no horse
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

2310
02:28:26,438 --> 02:28:27,831
I can understand that.

2311
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:29,098
Frankie,

2312
02:28:29,753 --> 02:28:31,543
why don't you take
them sticks off that horse

2313
02:28:31,545 --> 02:28:33,380
and stick them in the nigger cage.

2314
02:28:34,930 --> 02:28:36,966
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

2315
02:28:48,628 --> 02:28:51,399
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't you?

2316
02:28:51,505 --> 02:28:52,506
Yeah, right.

2317
02:28:52,653 --> 02:28:54,645
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

2318
02:28:55,469 --> 02:28:56,270
Right.

2319
02:28:56,948 --> 02:28:59,594
Now, don't drop the fucking thing,
alright?

2320
02:29:00,067 --> 02:29:01,852
I've just had the sights fixed,

2321
02:29:01,969 --> 02:29:03,009
and they're perfect.

2322
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,186
Oh, that's good to know.

2323
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:38,280
Throw me up that dynamite.

2324
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:10,331
Jake!
Yeah?

2325
02:32:10,802 --> 02:32:13,876
Get out there and see what's
wrong with them goddamn dogs!

2326
02:32:18,764 --> 02:32:20,205
D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

2327
02:32:26,266 --> 02:32:26,785
Hey!

2328
02:33:50,306 --> 02:33:51,489
Auf Wiedersehen.

2329
02:34:52,117 --> 02:34:53,327
It's me, baby.

2340
02:36:13,585 --> 02:36:15,265
Would you prepare us some coffee?

2341
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,828
Sheba, you help her.

2342
02:36:17,995 --> 02:36:18,888

2346
02:36:39,828 --> 02:36:41,643
Just a bit sooner
than you all was expecting.

2347
02:36:50,471 --> 02:36:51,385
Billy Crash.

2348
02:36:52,197 --> 02:36:53,345
Now, where were we?

2349
02:36:55,267 --> 02:36:56,150
That's right.

2350
02:36:56,725 --> 02:36:58,121
Last time I seen you,

2351
02:36:58,635 --> 02:37:01,030
you had your hands on my...

2352
02:37:13,685 --> 02:37:15,091
Django!

2353
02:37:15,232 --> 02:37:17,274
You black son of a bitch!

2354
02:37:17,430 --> 02:37:18,503
The D is silent, hillbilly.

2355
02:37:19,098 --> 02:37:21,005
Oh, no!

2356
02:37:22,976 --> 02:37:23,927
Now,

2357
02:37:24,646 --> 02:37:25,840
all you black folks,

2358
02:37:26,119 --> 02:37:29,048
I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

2359
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:31,515
Not you, Stephen.

2360
02:37:32,946 --> 02:37:34,299
You right where you belong.

2361
02:37:36,949 --> 02:37:38,292
Cora, before you go,

2362
02:37:39,177 --> 02:37:40,744
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

2363
02:37:41,537 --> 02:37:42,740
Do what now?

2364
02:37:43,228 --> 02:37:45,188
I said tell Miss Lara,

2365
02:37:45,649 --> 02:37:46,458
goodbye.

2366
02:37:48,283 --> 02:37:49,226
Bye, Miss Lara.

2367
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:55,407
Y'all two run along now.

2368
02:38:14,147 --> 02:38:15,042
Stephen,

2369
02:38:15,694 --> 02:38:16,757
how you like my...

2370
02:38:17,132 --> 02:38:18,053
new duds?

2371
02:38:19,274 --> 02:38:21,538
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

2372
02:38:33,544 --> 02:38:35,328
I count six shots, nigger.

2373
02:38:36,890 --> 02:38:38,507
I count two guns, nigger.

2374
02:38:42,598 --> 02:38:44,825
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

2375
02:38:44,827 --> 02:38:46,788
you seen all manner
a shit done to niggers.

2376
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:48,484
But I notice,

2377
02:38:49,322 --> 02:38:50,439
you didn't mention kneecapping.

2378
02:38:51,414 --> 02:38:54,133
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

2379
02:38:54,234 --> 02:38:55,773
Seventy-six years, Stephen.

2380
02:38:56,441 --> 02:38:58,212
How many niggers you think
you see come and go?

2381
02:38:58,402 --> 02:38:59,456
Seven thousand?

2382
02:39:00,178 --> 02:39:01,318
Eight thousand?

2383
02:39:02,056 --> 02:39:03,133
Nine thousand?

2384
02:39:03,764 --> 02:39:05,955
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

2385
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:09,291
Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth

2386
02:39:09,299 --> 02:39:10,459
was nothing but horseshit.

2387
02:39:10,715 --> 02:39:12,167
But he was right about one thing.

2388
02:39:12,665 --> 02:39:14,560
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

2389
02:39:17,243 --> 02:39:19,110
You son of a bitch!

2390
02:39:20,375 --> 02:39:21,764
You motherfucker!

2391
02:39:22,488 --> 02:39:24,718
Oh, sweet Jesus, let me kill this nigger!

2392
02:39:26,277 --> 02:39:28,505
You ain't gonna get away with this,
Django!

2393
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:31,146
They gonna catch your black ass.

2394
02:39:31,496 --> 02:39:34,117
You gonna be
on the wanted posters now, nigger.

2395
02:39:34,119 --> 02:39:36,364
The bounty hunters gonna be
looking for you.

2396
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:38,813
You can run, nigger,

2397
02:39:39,016 --> 02:39:41,031
but they gonna find your ass!

2398
02:39:41,291 --> 02:39:43,933
And when they do, oh, Lord,

2399
02:39:43,934 --> 02:39:45,174
what they gonna do to your ass!

2400
02:39:45,285 --> 02:39:47,918
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!

2401
02:39:48,282 --> 02:39:49,915
You done fucked up!

2402
02:39:50,305 --> 02:39:52,332
This Candyland, nigger!

2403
02:39:52,669 --> 02:39:54,865
You can't destroy Candyland!

2404
02:39:55,314 --> 02:39:56,612
We been here!

2405
02:39:56,614 --> 02:39:59,221
There's always gonna be
a Candyland!

2406
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:13,397
Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!

2407
02:40:13,465 --> 02:40:16,191
They gonna find your black ass!

2408
02:40:20,701 --> 02:40:23,323
Django!

2409
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:25,928
You uppity son of a...

2410
02:41:00,527 --> 02:41:02,070
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

2411
02:41:02,863 --> 02:41:04,781
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.

2412
02:41:32,492 --> 02:41:33,983
You know what they
are going to call you?

2413
02:41:34,658 --> 02:41:36,390
The fastest gun in the South.

2414
02:41:44,363 --> 02:41:45,673
Let's get outta here.
