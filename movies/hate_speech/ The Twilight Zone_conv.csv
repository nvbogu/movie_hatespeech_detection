1323,There was a flameout and we lost it.
1324,Lightning?
1325,Lightning.
1326,"Mr. Valentine, this aircraft has four engines."
1327,The possibility of us losing one of the remaining three is remote.
1328,Are you sure it was just lightning?
1329,Absolutely.
1330,"Listen, we're gonna be landing in about 20 minutes."
1331,There is the highest probability that we'll survive this flight.
