66,"Tracy's flamboyant flip is all the rage, Miss Edna."
67,"Jackie Kennedy, our first lady, even rats her hair."
68,"But Tracy ain't no first lady, are you, Tracy?"
69,"No, sirree, she's a hairhopper."
70,That's what she is.
71,"Now, I've got nothing but hampers of ironing to do..."
72,and my diet pill is wearing off.
73,"Tracy, I want you to go to your room and study."
74,"And Penny, don't you be listening..."

82,"Penny Pingleton, you know you were punished."
83,"From now on, you're wearing a giant P on your blouse every day to school..."
84,so that the whole world knows that Penny Pingleton is permanently...
85,positively punished.
86,Eight o'clock.

88," Bye, honey."
89,I said no.

101,"Leave me alone, Mother."
102,I have a pimple.
103,"Heh, you had to choose a colored record as your favorite song?"

111,We have to have a little talk.
112,"You know, if your father is forced to integrate Tilted Acres..."
113,we're out of business.
114,So at least act white on television.
115,"Leave me alone, Mother."
116,"""Shake a Tail Feather"" is a wild song."
117,It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.
118,"Oh, God, of all nights."
119,"A Corny Collins record hop, and I've got craters."
120,"Unh, just pop it. Pop it."

133, Ugh.
134,I ought to know.
135,"Don't forget, I was Miss Soft Crab in 1945."
136,And that title wasn't handed to me on a silver platter. I worked for it.
137,"Now come on. A one, two, a one, two, three, pony."
138,Mash potatoes.
139,Faster.
140,"Amber, I'd like to talk to you."
141,"Yes, Daddy?"
142,Don't stop. Chacha.
143, I'm tired.

145,"One, two, chachacha."
146,"I had some new campaign fliers made up today, all for Daddy's little girl."
147,"Now, I want you to hand those out at the hop tonight to everyone."
148,Each and every one of those.
149, Twist.
150," Oh, Daddy, ugh."
151,"No lip from you, Miss ingrate."
152,This campaign is costing us an arm and a leg.
153,"New gowns, hairdresser three times a week."
154,Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat up all the profits from the TiltAWhirl.
155,Do as Daddy says or we'll send you to Catholic school where you belong.
156," Right, Franklin?"
157, That's right. Catholic school.
158,"Pass the macaroni and cheese, please."
159,Did you take that appetite suppressant I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?
160,"Mother, I'm a growing teenager."
161,I need food.
162,"Let her eat, Edna."
163,"Tracy, did you do your chores around the house today?"
164,"Not Miss Tracy, Cyd Charisse herself."
165,She's too busy ratting her hair and doing the Ubangi stomp.
166,"Tracy, we all have responsibilities in life."
167,You may think owning the Hardy Har joke shop is all drudgery...
168,"unwrapping dribble glasses, checking doggie doo inventory..."
169,but I love it.
170,You'll see. Work can be fun.
171,Can I please be excused to go to the library to study?
172,"Let's have a ball at the hall tonight Boot it girl till the early bright Make a scene with the record machine At the dancin' party tonight Come on let's try mashed potatoes too What's the problem, officer?"
173, This is a white establishment.
174," Oh, come on."
175,"Hey, listen, we just came to dance."
176, That's not fair.
177," Open your purse, please."
178,And everything's all right Go. Go.
179,"Mess around, Bristol Stompin' too Pony now like it's all brand new Any dance that you wanna do Boys and girls, stay on the dance floor."
180,Here comes the hottest tune of the day.
181,And it started right here in Baltimore.
182,"And where did you see it first, kids?"
183,The Corny Collins Show.
184,"A big strong line, ladies and gentlemen. It's ""Madison Time."" I can do that dance."

187,"because it's dance contest time, and we've got the wildest judge in town."
188,You listen to her every night on WEDD and she hosts Negro Day...
189,on The Corny Collins Show.
190,The last Thursday of every month.
191,A warm welcome for the queen of Baltimore soul...
192,"Miss Motormouth Maybelle herself, ladies and gentlemen."

204,Is it going to be couple number one?
205,Or is it couple number two?
206,Or shall it be couple number three?
207,All right.
208,I think we have a winner.
209,And that winner is...
210,"I love them tender, Tracy and Fender."
211,All right.
212,Tracy Turnblad and Fender.
213,"Tracy Turnblad, you are the queen of the hop tonight."
214,"We hold auditions for the Council tomorrow. Come down, strut your stuff."
215,"Oh, Corny, do you really think I'm good enough?"
216,"What do you think, Kids?"
217,Yeah!
218,"I hear you. Thanks for coming down, Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow."
219,"Now, Motormouth, I think it's time we slowed things down a little..."
220,with Mr. Gene Pitney.
221,You can't hide your face in this godforsaken place.
222,"Here in your own city, there's a town without pity, heh."
223,"Gene Pitney, ladies and gentlemen."
224,When you're young and so and love As we And bewildered by the world we see Why do people hurt us so Only those in love would know What a town without pity can do Whore.
225,"How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two What a town without pity can do No, it isn't very pretty What a town without pity can do Hey, diddily da Yeah, yeah, yeah Come on and make a line Continental, continental Hey, diddily dee Oh, yeah, you're looking fine Continental, continental Come on Let's go It's continental time Continental, continental Hey, diddily doo Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah This dance is all brand new Continental, continental Hey, diddily doo Aha, it's such a ball to do Continental, continental Thank you, girls."
226,And now it's time to move on to a little something we call the spotlight.
227,"Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?"
228,"Uh, I'm just a little nervous."
229,"This is show business, young lady."
230,"If you think you're nervous now, ha."
231,Wait till you're on the air.
232,"Okay, first question?"
233,"Are you now, or have you ever gone steady?"
234,"Well, I'm not going with anybody now, but I'd love to date a Council Member."
235, Pfft. She wishes.
236," Yeah, right."
237,Come on.
238,Exactly how many sweaters do you have?
239,"Gee, I never counted."
240,I guess about five.
241,Five?
242,Next.
243,"Nadine Carver, Eastern High School."
244,Are you aware Negro Day is the last Thursday of every month?
245,"Yes, I've been on it a few times."
246,I feel the show should be integrated every day.
247,Can you relate to Lesley Gore's music?
248,"Look, she ain't no James Brown..."
249,but I can dance to Lawrence Welk if I have to.
250,Lawrence Welk?
251,"Thank you, Nadine."
252,Tracy Turnblad.
253,Would you do a pimple cream commercial on camera...
254,if Corny asked you to?
255,I'd be proud to.
256,"Luckily, I've never been cursed with acne like others."
257,But I realize the devastating effect of skin blemishes...
258,on the social life of teenagers.
259,"Would you ever, heh, swim in an integrated swimming pool, heh?"
260,"Oh, my God."
261," I certainly would, Iggy."
262, Heh.
263,I'm a modern kind of girl.
264,I'm all for integration.
265,"Ugh, aren't you a little fat for the show?"
266,"That's enough, Amber."
267,I would imagine that many home viewers are also pleasantly plump or chunky.
268,"Oh, come on. The show's not filmed in CinemaScope, heh."
269,"You're out of line, Amber."
270, Ow.
271," Corny, Tammy, can't you see?"
272, This girl's a trash can.
273, That's five demerit points.
274,You're suspended from the show today.
275,Pack your things. Go home.
276,"Oh, my God."
277, I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
278, I'm sure we can find a replacement.
279," Yes, Corny."
280," Please, wait outside."
281,"The Council will now meet in secret, debate your personality flaws..."
282,and come to a final decision.
283,Miss Edna!
284,Miss Edna!
285,"Penny Pingleton, you'll wake the dead."
286,Tracy's not home yet.
287,Plus your mother called and she's on the warpath.
288,"I know, Miss Edna."
289,Can I come in?
290,"Oh, there's something you have gotta see."
291,"Well, yeah, come on up..."
292,but I've got ironing and Wilbur's working.
293,Mr. Turnblad!
294,"It's not war with Cuba, is it?"
295, Or more Negro problems?
296," No, you'll see."
297,Did poor Debbie Reynolds have a nervous breakdown?
298,This better be good.
299,Broad daylight and I'm sitting in front of a TV.
300,"I've seen The Corny Collins Show., thank you."
301, Just watch.
302, I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.
303, This better be worth it.
304," Wait, you'll see. Just watch."
305, What's your name?
306, I'm Ruby.
307, And you?
308, Dee Dee.
309, What about you?
310, I'm Lucille.
311,Where will you be appearing tonight?
312,We'll be at the Royal Theater.
313, At Motormouth Maybelle  All soul review.
314,"All right, ladies and gentlemen..."
315,a big hand for Baltimore's own Trinklettes.
316,I closed up shop for this?
317,Just wait.
318,Let's keep the music playing...
319,and the hits aturning with Mr. Gene Chandler...
320,because the Duke of Earl loves to chacha.
321,"There, there. Look."
322,It's Tracy.
323,"Oh, my God."
324,She's all peroxided up.
325,I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.
326,"With a triple process, yet."
327,But Tracy was accepted on the Corny Collins Council.
328,"Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, your daughter's a star."
329,"And you, you are my girl And no one can hurt you, oh, no See? She's already getting closeups."
330,Does she get paid for this?
331, Big as a house.
332," I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh."
333,Hello.
334,"Uh, yes, I'm watching her now."
335,"You are? Well, thank you, heh."
336,Yes. Good bye.
337,That was Hilda from up Conklin Street.
338,She's going to send a telegram.
339,"Oh, God, there she is."
340,"Nothing can stop me, now 'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah It's time to introduce someone very special."
341,A new Council Member making her first appearance on the show...
342,and we already have telegrams.
343,Introduce yourself.
344,"Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad and I go to Mervel High."
345,"Well, someone out there likes you."
346,"""Please, have the new girl lead a ladies' choice."" I was supposed to lead the ladies' choice."
347," Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?"
348," No, I'm not."
349,But there is somebody I've got a crush on.
350,"Who, I'd like to know?"
351,She's just a child.
352,"Well, let's see who the lucky guy is."
353,"Ladies and gentlemen, a ladies' choice."
354,"Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny."
355,She can't hear you.
356,She better hadn't dare.
357,"If you should lose me Oh, yeah You'll lose a good thing If you should lose me Oh, yeah You'll lose a good thing You know I love you Do anything for you Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the oath of the friendship ring."
358,"Oh, don't cry, honey."
359,You'll lose a good thing I'm givin' you one more chance For you to do right If you'll only straighten up We'll have a good life That fat girl's no competition.
360,"White trash, plain and simple."
361,"For all we know, that girl could be high yellow."
362,"Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'll still be the queen of the auto show, won't I?"
363,"Oh, honey."
364,Tracy!
365,Tracy.
366,"No, she's not here."
367,"Well, I'm sure she loves you too."
368,"Yes, thank you. Goodbye."
369,This is amazing.
370,She's so popular already.
371,She could be one of The June Taylor Dancers.
372,Hello.
373,"Well, yes, I am Tracy Turnblad's agent."
374,"Give me a pencil. Quick, quick."
375,How may I help you?
376,"Mmhm, mmhm."
377,Here's Tracy.
378,"Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful."
379," Honey, we're real proud of you."
380, We'll be there.
381,"Oh, sweetie, listen."
382,"Tomorrow, get up just a bit closer so we can see you better."
383,"And maybe even give the Hardy Har a little ppp plug, heh."
384,"Oh, Mom, Dad."
385,"Oh, Penny, my best friend."
386,I'm so happy.
387,"Finally all of Baltimore knows, I'm big, blond and beautiful."
388,You're a teen leader now.
389,And the show biz offers are pouring in.
390,Tonight we have an audition.
391,"Honey, this is only the beginning."
392,Stick with me and we'll claw our way to the top.
393,"Oh, God."
394,"Fame, fortune, glamour."
395,And to top it off...
396, ...I'm in love.
397, Oh.
398,"Wow, Tracy, you're really tough."
399,"Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do you think about this one?"
400, I like it.
401, Oh.
402,Wilbur would kill us if we spent that much.
403,"You look gorgeous, Bertha."
404,Simply exquisite.
405," Oh, I don't know, Pinky."
406, Have an Ã©clair.
407,Oh.
408,"Eat up, girls. Eat up."

412," Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky."
413, Hi.
414,"Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business manager, Edna Turnblad."
415,"Well, it's a pleasure to meet the both of you."
416,"Here, we cater to bigboned gals like yourself who are stylish..."
417,and at the same time frustrated by the lack of sizes in stores today.
418,I saw you on TV.
419,I want you to be my model.
420,"Would, uh...?"
421,Would she be paid for this?
422,One free outfit a month.
423,You start tomorrow. I hope there's no diets in the works...
424,because I want to design your Miss Auto Show coronation gown myself.
425,"Could, uh, could you throw a pair of complimentary pettipants in the deal?"
426,"You drive a hard bargain, Miss Edna, and rightfully so."
427,"Pettipants, pettigirdle, you just let Tracy take her pick."
428,How about a fabulous frock just for me?
429,Tracy has to work one extra day for free.
430,It's a deal.
431," Thank you, Mr. Pinky."
432, Hahaha.
433,I'm going to make you a star.
434,I hope your father likes this.
435,He'll love it. You look beautiful.
436,It's the new you.
437,"Oh, mom, come on. Come on."
438, Go in the beauty shop?
439, Yes.

442, Come on. You deserve it.
443," No, Wilbur will kill me."
444, Come on.
445," Oh, okay."
446, You really think I should?
447, Yes.
448,"Come on, Mom."
449," Mama, welcome to the '60s."
450, Heh.
451, I'll talk to you after biology.
452," See you after PE, guys."
453,"In the figure shown, line segment AB and line segment CD..."
454,are chords of the circle.
455,Line segment PA and line segment PC...
456,"What is the problem, Mr. Davis?"
457,I can't see through her hair.
458,I can't help it if he's short.

810,"With an iron, man."
811,"I play my bongos, listen to Odetta, and then I iron my hair. Dig?"
812,I think we'd better get going now.
813,The coast looks clear.
814,Let's do some reefer. We'll get high and I'll iron the chicks' hair.
815,Reefer? Oh.
816,Drugs?
817,Locoweed.
818,"When I'm high, I am Odetta."
819,Let's get naked and smoke.
820,Cool.
821,Don't breathe it in.
822,You'll be addicted.
823,"Later, sister, later."
824,Much later.
825,"I saw the best minds of my generation Destroyed by madness Starving, hysterical, naked Dragging themselves..."
826,Angelheaded hipsters burning for The ancient heavenly connection To the starry dynamo In the machinery of night Who poverty and tatters and holloweyed And sat up smoking in the...
827," Oh, hi, Dad."
828, Dad?
829,"Don't ""hi, Dad"" me."
830,The whole world saw you on the news.
831,"Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson."
832,"He's a psychiatrist, and he's going to make you all better."
833,"Feeling depressed, Penny?"
834,Want to talk about it?
835,Think of all the white boys in school and how much you'd like to date one.
836,Be a good little girl and slip this on.
837,Shock treatments are the answer.
838," Come here, Penny."
839, What are you doing?
840,Good girl. Good girl.
841," I love you, Seaweed!"
842, Shut up!
843, Get her in the car.
844," It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick."
845,"Prudy, this is totally unnecessary."
846,"Come on, honey. Time to go home."
847,You can see Link tomorrow.
848,We've been worried sick about you.
849,This neighborhood's no place for a star.
850,Get in that car before someone sees you.
851,Tilted acres is not fair!
852,Racist people everywhere!
853,Tilted acres is not fair!
854,Racist people everywhere!
855, Get out of here.
856, Go back where you belong.
857,"Well, personally, I have nothing against them."
858,It's merely a matter of economics.
859,Tilted Acres will never be integrated.
860, Segregation today.
861, Segregation tomorrow.
862,Segregation forever.
863,Hey.
864,"One black face gets on camera, this show's off the air."
865,The kids don't care if blacks dance on the show.
866,This is ripping the city apart.
867,"Motormouth Maybelle is out there, and she's our friend."
868,We've done hops together for years.
869,The kids love her.
870,The Corny Collins Show remains white.
871,Or you're all fired.
872,"Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome to The Corny Collins Show."
873,"Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres."
874,"Hop in the car, bring the whole family, come out."
875,Right now I want to introduce to you the top contenders...
876,"in the Miss Auto Show contest, Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad."
877,I understand you're both going to introduce a new dance in the show today.
878,"Yes, I am, Corny."
879,It's called the Limbo Rock.
880,And I bet some people will find it quite difficult.
881,"Here it is, the Limbo Rock."
882,"Every limbo boy and girl All around the limbo world Gonna do the limbo rock All around the limbo clock Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick Jack, go under limbo stick All around the limbo clock Hey, let's do the limbo rock Good afternoon, Penny."
883,Feeling better?
884,Getting in touch with your anger?
885,"Go, Tracy, go!"
886,"Limbo ankle, limbo knee Bend back like a limbo tree Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick Jack, go under limbo stick I watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white."
887,"You know, Edna, I've been reading about these kids."
888,Maybe Tracy could be some sort of campus leader.
889,"Wilbur, it's the times."
890,They're achanging.
891,Something's blowing in the wind.
892,"Fetch me my diet pills, would you, hon?"
893,Get yourself a limbo girl Go back to Africa where you came from.
894,Your kind's not wanted here.
895,"Baltimore, you saw it here first."
896,The Limbo Rock.
897,"Thank you very much, Amber."
898," I'm a winner, Corny."
899," Well, Amber, you won the dance..."
900,but let's check the election results to see how you're doing.
901,We have an upset.
902,"For the first time, Tracy Turnblad is number one with a bullet."
903,"What do you have to say for yourself, Tracy?"
904,"If elected, I plan to represent all of Baltimore."
905,Today I'd like to introduce a brandnew dance...
906,and dedicate it to some of my special friends...
907,"who, because of smallminded people, can't be here with me today."
908,My dance is called the Waddle.
909,That girl's got roaches in her hair.
910,Roaches?
911,My little Tracy's a clean teen.
912,There's no bugs on our baby.
913,I'm not kidding.
914,I just saw one.
915,"Amber, you're such a comedian, heh."
916,"Ladies and gentlemen, Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle."
917,You all make me sick.
918, Tammy.
919, What is going on here?
920," Look, we had nothing to do with it."
921, It isn't our fault.
922,"Seaweed, come on."
923,Seaweed.
924,"Tracy, just keep dancing."
925,Move it around here.
926,"What, are you crazy?"
927,Come on. Move out.
928,That's why I would like to humbly state...
929,Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
930,Mommy. Daddy.
931, There's a riot going on.
932, A riot?
933, A race riot.

991,"We're going to go down in the history books for this one, Velma."

996, We joined the NAACP.
