427,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CONTINUE SINGING)</font> Duty calls."
428,I'll take a snow check on that dance.
429," Canadian for ""rain check.""  Okay. <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(SPEAKS FRENCH)</font>  Okay."
430,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CONTINUE SINGING)</font> Man, you're pounding 'em kinda hard, don't you think?"
431,"I got fired today, man."
432,You told me you quit.
433,I was forced to quit because of...
434,"Yeah, okay, man."
435,Lie to me some more.
436,You good?
437,Shit. Is the secretary of state looking at us?
438,"Oh, she's looking at you?"
439,Fred.
440,Fred. What the hell? What was that?
441,"Damn. Hey, what was that?"
442,I...
443,I kinda... I kinda know her. Okay?
444, You kinda know her?
445, Yeah.
446,"Nobody kinda knows Charlotte Field, all right?"
447,"It's like kinda knowing a mermaid, dude. You tell people that shit."
448, That's exceptional.
449, Okay.
450,I'll tell you a story.
451,"So, I'm like 13, she's like 16."
452,She's my babysitter.
453,"She's like, perfect."
454,"She's very nice to me, which goes a long way with me."
455,"So, we're at her house."
456,She's practicing a speech that she's writing.
457,She's running for Student Council president.
458,"Did you know that every year, the school throws away over 500 tons of recyclable garbage?"
459, And no one cares.
460," I know, it's total bullshit."
461,But how do you get idiots to care about shit they don't care about?
462,They'll just care because it's the right thing to care about.
463,You're more inspiring than George Bush and Dan Quayle combined.
464,"Well, that's not too hard."
465,"<font color""ff00ff"">(BOTH LAUGH)</font> <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Well, she was amazing, and she was smart, and she seemed to kinda like me, and I felt like we were having a moment."
466,You know what I mean?
467,Like a romantic moment.
468,"Oh, shit."
469,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: So I did something that, in retrospect, was highly inappropriate."
470,I kissed her.
471,I looked down...
472,I got a fucking  Oh!
473, Hard... but not big.
474,"But hard. And pronounced, ""13yearold boner."" Sorry."
475,And she looks at it.
476,She sees it. And she goes...
477,It's okay.
478," <font color""ff00ff"">(GROANS)</font>  And then, her boyfriend comes into the room, who was in the other room watching Blossom!"
479,"Hey, babe."
480,Points out my fucking little boner.
481, He makes a joke!
482, Whoa!
483,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: And they left."
484,"<font color""ff00ff"">(MOUTHING)</font> I'm sorry."
485,And I'm left standing there alone...
486,"...in the kitchen, with my little, hard  Hard as a rock."
487," And on top of that, she didn't win the fucking election."
488,Bill Sterling won because he ran on a twoprom platform.
489, Twoprom!
490, Two proms! Backtoback!
491,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SCOFFS)</font> She didn't stand a fucking chance."
492,"No, man."
493,I think you're skimming over the best part of that story.
494,What's the best part of that story?
495,She says your boner was okay.
496,"She said, ""It's okay,"" like she was trying to not make me fucking feel bad."
497,"Fred, you see a fuckedup story, when I see a beautiful story about a girl that you liked, liking your boner in all of its okayness."
498,You need to talk to her tonight.
499,"She probably doesn't remember who I am, and if she does remember who I am, the last thing she wants is my 13yearoldbonerhaving fucking ass walking up to her."
500, Look... Whoa.
501," <font color""ff8000"">AGENT M</font>: Excuse me."
502,Secretary Field would like to speak with you.
503, With me?
504," With him, right?"
505, Yeah.
506," <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Right now?"
507,"Uh, do you know why?"
508,This way.
509,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SOFTLY)</font> This is good."
510,What you nervous about?
511,What the fuck?
512,Everything I just said!
513,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SINGING SLOW R&B SONG)</font> Oh, my God, dude, there she is."
514,"<font color""ff00ff"">(BOYZ II MEN VOCALIZING)</font> What are you gonna say to her?"
515,I don't know.
516,Should open with a neg.
517,Tell her she's too tall.
518,I'm not gonna neg the secretary of state.
519, It was so nice to see you.
520," <font color""ff8000"">WOMAN</font>: You as well."
521,Give me the signal when you need me.
522, Hi.
523, Hi.
524,A man brought me here.
525,"Yes, sorry about that."
526, Um...
527," No, not at all."
528,I can't shake this feeling that we know each other.
529, We do. Yeah.
530, We do?
531, We do know each other.
532," Okay, so I'm not crazy."
533," Uh, I'm Fred."
534, Fred...
535,"I was shorter,  but other than that..."
536, Flarsky?
537,Yeah! Holy fuck!
538,I can't believe it.
539,You remember.
540,"Oh, my God, look at you!"
541,"Look at me, yes."
542,What are you doing here?
543,"My friend, Lance... That's Lance."
544,"Hey, how you doing?"
545,"He, uh, he just brought me here to see Boyz II Men."
546,I just met them.
547, You met the Men?
548, Yeah.
549, What was it like?
550," Don't tell anybody, but it was the highlight of my life."
551," Oh, I totally get that."
552, And I've met the Dalai Lama.
553,Fuck him. How many hits does he have? None.
554," <font color""ff00ff"">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>  Don't actually fuck him."
555, He's a wonderful man.
556, Yeah.
557,What are you doing these days?
558,I bet it's something amazing.
559, It's pretty amazing.
560, Yeah.
561,"Uh, yeah, but it's still in its, uh, gestation period, I guess."
562,I don't need to get into it. What about you? What have you been up to?
563,You're the secretary... I'm joking.
564,I know what you've been up to.
565," Yeah. <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS)</font>  You're very, um..."
566,"You know, I just, I..."
567,"I just wanna say it's, like, amazing to see what you've done with your life."
568,"A lot of people say they're gonna do all this incredible stuff and they don't do anything, but you actually did it all, so, congrats."
569,"Well, I'm trying."
570,"I think you've done it. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> <font color""ff8000"">MAN</font>: Oh!"
571,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Parker Wembley."
572,I hate this guy.
573,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Parker Wembley, the guy who buys and sells newspapers and thinks that hurricanes are caused by gay marriage?"
574, You know him?
575, He's coming over here.
576, Is he behind me?
577, Yeah.
578, Finally. Secretary Field.
579," Parker, how are you?"
580,You are looking particularly gorgeous tonight.
581,Thank you.
582,"I... I've been trying to set a meeting with you for some months now, and, uh..."
583,"I mean, have you been avoiding me?"
584,No! No.
585, Not successfully.
586," <font color""ff00ff"">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)</font>  Who's your friend?"
587, Fred.
588," Hey, Fred!"
589," Yes, hi."
590, How are you?
591,"And, uh, what is it that you do?"
592,"I'm a journalist, actually. Yeah."
593," Ooh, a journalist."
594, Mmmhmm. Yeah.
595,Will I have read anything that you've written?
596,Probably not recently 'cause I'm unemployed at the moment.
597,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that."
598,Not your fault.
599,"Excuse me, Secretary Field, we need a word."
600," Oh, okay."
601, So we will have that meeting.
602, Right?
603, Yes.
604,"Okay, good. Fred."
605, Yes?
606, Best of luck.
607," Oh, why, thanks."
608, Things will turn around for you.
609, So nice of you.
610, Darkest before the dawn and all that.
611, I actually... I do have to...
612, Yeah.
613,You probably have a lot of things to do. Better than this.
614,It's really nice to see you again.
615, Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Great.
616," <font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHS)</font> Oh, you're backless."
617,Wasn't expecting that.
618, Have fun at the party.
619, You too.
620,Great to see you.
621,I see you. I see you. Yeah.
622,"<font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHING)</font> <font color""ff8000"">PARKER</font>: So I said, ""You want..."" Hey. Hey. What's that look in your eye? What are you about to go do?"
623,"Tonight is about the animals, dude."
624,Fuck the animals!
625,"They're fucking gone, man."
626,Too late for the fucking animals.
627,"<font color""ff00ff"">(LAUGHING)</font> Hey!"
628," <font color""ff8000"">PARKER</font>: Oh, Fred?"
629," Yeah, look."
630, What's the problem?
631, I'll tell you the problem.
632, What?
633," You're the problem, man!"
634,You're everything that's wrong with this fucking country.
635,"'Cause you're an old, rich, white piece of shit and your media conglomerate is ruining this planet!"
636, Enough.
637, I'm done anyway.
638,"I had more time with you than I thought I would, so joke's on you."
639,"Excuse me, thank you."
640,"Whoa, shit! <font color""ff00ff"">(YELLING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(GRUNTS)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(CROWD GASPS)</font> God!"

642,"Oh, my God."
643,"<font color""ff8000"">GUEST</font>: Looks like it hurt."
644,"Boyz II Men, back up."
645,You all right? You good?
646, You all right?
647, I'm okay!
648,He's okay!
649,How is he standing?
650,"<font color""ff00ff"">(HIPHOP SONG PLAYING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(SONG PLAYING ON PHONE)</font>  <font color""ff8000"">ALL</font>: Oh!"
651, Ouch!
652,"âª Oh, no That's the Ruff Ryder... âª This is so creative."
653,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ALL LAUGHING)</font> Haha!"
654," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> What was that?"
655," Thank you, Tom."
656,"God, that was crazy."
657,"I mean, now that we know he's okay, it was all so hilarious."
658,And so what is the relationship exactly?
659, Was he your super?
660, No.
661,We grew up next door to each other.
662," <font color""ff00ff"">(MAGGIE GASPS)</font>  Yeah."
663,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Fuck, I used to babysit for him."
664, You babysat for him?
665, I did.
666,Wow. Time has not been kind.
667,He was such a strange little kid.
668,But he was really funny.
669,And he was super smart.
670,"He did have this chip on his shoulder, though."
671,He's actually not a bad writer.
672,"Wait, you've read his stuff?"
673,"Yeah, Brooklyn Advocate."
674,"Oh, God, of course, you read that, Tom."
675,Didn't that paper just get sold off?
676,Wembley Media just bought them.
677,"Oh, that makes total sense."
678,That's why he was such a dick to Wembley.
679,So the rest of the schedule for the day is pretty packed.
680,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(KNOCK ON DOOR)</font>  Hi."
681, Hey.
682,Did you like any of those writing samples?
683,"Yeah, McKenzie is good."
684,Bess is solid.
685,"And, um, Fred's stuff isn't too bad."
686,"Wait, not the..."
687,the homeless person that fell down the stairs?
688,Yeah. He has a real voice.
689,"And he knows me. I mean, he knew me."
690,And that's probably a good thing if he's going to be writing for me.
691,"Bringing someone like that onto the team, I have to say, feels a little reckless."
692,His writing is really good.
693,And it's funny.
694,I think he can get that number up by a few points.
695,"And if he doesn't, we fire him."
696,Okay.
697,Fred Flarsky it is.
698,Thanks.
699,"<font color""ff00ff"">(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font> All right, bye."

701,I don't give a fuck.
702,Answer that shit.
703, What?
704, Answer it!
705,What if it's The Man trying to get at me?
706,"No, it's the universe trying to talk to you."
707,Really?
708, Gang.
709, Gang.
710,"Do that shit, man."
711,"Fred, don't fuck with me."
712,All right. Hello. Gang.
713, Mr. Flarsky?
714, What?
715,"Wait, slow down. What?"
716, You're unknown. Pardon?
717," Oh, my God. Mr. Flarsky."
718, Hello?
719, Go on.
720,This is Maggie Millikin from Secretary Field's office.
721,"Hello, Maggie, who works for Secretary Field."
722, Whoo!
723, Hello?
724,"<font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> That's good! Talk to her."
725, Hello?
726, How can I help you?
727,The secretary would like to meet with you immediately.
728,We will send a car over.
729,Can you give me the most convenient address?
730, What is she saying?
731, Secretary would like to meet with me immediately and they're going to send a car?
732,Mr. Lou's Deli in Brooklyn.
733, I'm sure you can find it.
734, I will Google it.
735, Mr. Lou's in Brooklyn. Stay right there.
736, Okay.
737,"Uh, I'll see you soon."
738,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Oh, I feel so scared."
739,Do I look okay? Do I look funny?
740, Why are these pockets here?
741," <font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: It's okay."
742,Godfuckingdamn it!
743,Why am I wearing these fucking stupid pants?
744,They're too tapered!
745,"Who wears these sillylooking, fucking tapered cargo pants and see the fucking secretary of state?"
746,You can't think like this.
747,You have to be positive.
748, Mr. Flarsky?
749," <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Oh, shit."
750,Mr. Flarsky.
751,"Wish me luck, man."
752,"Yeah, you don't need luck, man. She said it was okay. Luck is for losers."
753,You've got destiny on your side.
754,You're good. Fred.
755,You buy the body.
756,That doesn't mean anything.
757,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ENGINE STARTS)</font> <font color""ff8000"">LANCE</font>: Fred, put your seat belt on."
758,Take care of my friend. All right?
759, I look normal?
760, You look cool.
761,"I love you, Fred!"
762,Bad boys for life!
763,Empty your pockets and take off your backpack.
764,Empty my pockets?
765,All right. That's...
766,Let's see how this goes.
767,"Not a regular cop, I assume."
768,"Got bigger fish to fry than just normal cop shit, right?"
769,"So, uh, okay. Let's do it."
770,"<font color""ff00ff"">(EXHALES)</font> That's prescription."
771,For anxiety. Uh...
772,This is if you can't dance for a long time and you want to.
773,"That's prescription as well, for, uh, lack of energy."
774,That's energy powder.
775,These are to wrap the anxiety medication in when inhaling it medicinally.
776,"That's if you want to vaporize the anxiety medicine, which I have a prescription for."
777,And that's a blunt.
778,"<font color""ff00ff"">(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font> Ooh."
779,Hi.
780,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS DEEPLY)</font> <font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: Wow."
781,"Will you sign this, please?"
782, What is it?
783, It's an NDA.
784,A nondisclosure agreement?
785, That's right.
786, Okay.
787,"<font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> Oh, my God."
788,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Fred."
789, Yeah.
790," Hey, nice to see you again."
791," Hi, you too."
792, Come on in.
793,Take a seat.
794,Good to see you were not injured from that fall.
795,"Oh, yeah, you know what?"
796,I actually think the brim of my hat kind of protected my face ultimately.
797,"So, thank God I was underdressed in the end, right?"
798,"Well, as long as you're good."
799, I'm okay.
800, Yeah. Great.
801,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Uh..."
802,Why am I here?
803,"What I'm about to share with you is, obviously, highly confidential."
804,"Oh, yeah."
805,Keep it on the down low.
806,President Chambers will not be seeking reelection.
807, Really?
808," <font color""ff00ff"">(SOFTLY)</font> Yes."
809,That's fucking sick! That's awesome.
810,Are you telling each American individually the good news?
811,"I mean, but seriously."
812,Did he just realize he sucks at it and decide not to do it anymore?
813,He just wants to move into film and make movies.
814, Really?
815, Yeah.
816,That's cool. That's a tough transition to make.
817,Not many actors have made the leap from TV to film.
818,"You got George Clooney, you got Woody Harrelson..."
819,Jennifer Aniston.
820,"Mmm, did she though?"
821,You don't think Jennifer Aniston's a movie star?
822,Just 'cause you star in movies doesn't mean you're a movie star.
823,The point is...
824,He's going to endorse me for president in 2020.
825,Wow.
826, I know.
827, Mazel tov.
828,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> So."
829,We're headed to an environmental summit hosted by King Gustaf and the Swedish royal family.
830,"At the summit, I'll be announcing that the world's three largest polluters have signed on to the most comprehensive and exciting environmental deal ever."
831,"You know, after I have some dairy, I'm one of the world's three largest polluters."
832,Excuse me?
833,"We'll address rising sea levels, combat deforestation and protect the world's pollinators."
834,I'm calling it the Global Rehabilitation Initiative.
835,"Internally, we're referring to it as ""Bees, Trees and the Seas."" <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Soon after that, I hope to announce that  Wow."
836, At which point...
837,I will resign as secretary of state.
838,"Using this initiative as a springboard, I will announce my presidential run in 2020."
839, Cool.
840, So...
841,I need some writers to punch up my speeches.
842,I read your work and I really like it.
843,That's... Wow.
844,You mentioned you were between jobs.
845,So it's a really good fit.
846,"It's so nice of you to think of me at all, honestly, with everything going on in your head."
847, I look forward to working with you.
848, Thank you.
849,"Um... So, uh, when do you need to know by?"
850,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLING)</font> What?"
851,I don't understand.
852,"When do you need to know if I'm going to take your, uh, your punchup job?"
853,Right now.
854,"Oh. Uh... Then I guess, maybe... Maybe, uh, no?"
855,"Maybe no, I don't know."
856,I don't know!
857,"You know what, Madam Secretary, he's not interested. We tried."
858,It didn't work out. So I can give you some writing samples...
859,What don't you know?
860,"This whole Seas, Bees and Trees thing."
861,Is it actually going to do something?
862,"Or is it going to be one of those things that maybe only sounds like it's gonna do something, but doesn't actually do something?"
863,I only wanna come work for you if it's actually gonna do something.
864,It will do something.
865,This is a perfect document.
866,They all start out that way and then they get watered down.
867,Fred.
868,"Not only does this initiative sound good, it's going to do good."
869,It's gonna save the fucking planet.
870,"Not to mention, pay your rent."
871,"So, are you in?"
872,Or do you have something more important to do?
873,Than save the planet with you?
874,"No, I don't. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> I'm in."
875,"Whew! <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Let's save the planet."
876,That was...

879,"I had some jokes, uh, I was gonna run by you, maybe, if you have a second."
880,What are you...
881,What are you looking at?
882," <font color""ff00ff"">(GASPS)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(YELPS)</font>  Jesus!"
883," Oh, my God!"
884,Why would you just barge in here while I'm sleeping?
885, You were sleeping?
886, Yes!
887,I was micro napping.
888, That's what you call that?
889, Yes.
890,"Sorry, I didn't realize you were sleeping."
891,You were standing and your eyes were open.
892, Do you need something?
893, I have some jokes that I wrote that I was gonna run by you if you have a second.
894,"Yeah, that was actually a really good nap."
895,Great. Seemed very restful.
896,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Okay."
897,Whoa.
898,I feel like these jokes are a little angry.
899,"Oh. I thought maybe they were, like, emphatic?"
900,"""With every fracking drill thrust, we are literally buttfucking Mother Earth""?"
901,It can be normal fucking.
902,It doesn't have to be in the butt.
903,I can take that part out.
904,"Yeah, listen, Fred."
905,"If I'm angry, I'm hysterical."
906,"If I'm emotional, I'm weak."
907,"If I so much as raise my voice, I'm a bitch."
908,My job's hard.
909,Not as hard as mine.
910,"I think maybe, like, part of the problem is that, like, a lot of humor is based on, like, personal experiences."
911,"I was thinking, you know, you cared a lot about the environment  since high school."
912, Mmmhmm.
913,So maybe include some stories about that.
914, High school?
915, Yeah.
916, You think that's funny?
917, I think it's a good area.
918,"Nostalgia, pop culture references."
919,People love that.
920,Jimmy Fallon's made an entire career off of that.
921,"When I think about school, I just think about studying."
922,"No, you did so much more than that."
923,I think your whole 1991 platform was pretty onpoint when you were running for Student Council.
924,"I remember you said, ""Everyone at this school pretends to care about the underdog, but the planet Earth is the biggest underdog of them all.""  Something like that."
925, I said that?
926,"Yeah, you did say that."
927,"You were in the kitchen, making pizza."
928,We were making signs for your election.
929,And you were wearing that shirt.
930,"I don't know if it was a strawberry or a flower, it always confused me."
931,It was both.
932,"Oh, there you go."
933,"That's all I remember about that night, though."
934,"Uh, that's where my memories concerning that evening expire."
935,I learned a lot from that election.
936,"Yeah, that kids are probably more likely to vote for two proms than a very elaborate recycling program."
937," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font>  Not only kids."
938,"Yeah, that's true."
939,Did you know he asked me out to one of those proms?
940, Bill Sterling?
941, Yeah.
942,After he beat you?
943, Yup.
944, Prom one or prom two?
945,Oh!
946,What a fuckhead!
947,You're way better than prom two.
948,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS AND LAUGHS)</font> I went to zero proms, by the way, for the record."
949,I think you're the smart one in this situation.
950,"Yes, that's why I didn't go to prom."
951,'Cause I was too smart. Uh...
952,Cool. I'll get to work on that speech stuff.
953,Great.
954,"Hey, Fred."
955,Yeah.
956,"You know, if you want to try some nonjoke stuff, just go ahead."
957,Really?
958,Like the main part of the speech?
959,Yeah. Just write.
960,Cool. Awesome. Thanks.
961,"If you take another nap, you should put on, like, a bicycle helmet or something."
962,"'Cause you're gonna tip over, there's turbulence."
963, That's actually a really good idea.
964, It is. I want you to be careful.
965, Yeah.
966, We need you.
967,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</font>  <font color""ff00ff"">(BAND PLAYING)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(CROWD APPLAUDING)</font>  Ambassador."
968, Welcome to Sweden.
969,Nice to see you again.
970,"Yeah, you too."
971,I look forward to seeing you tonight at dinner.
972,Yes.
973,"Uh, Madam Secretary, I have some ideas I wanna throw by you."
974,"Yeah, soon, Fred."
975,"Tom, do you have the schedule?"
976," <font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: Yes, of course, ma'am."
977," <font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> All right."
978,"<font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: In the back, Flarsky!"
979,"<font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: Then at 8:15, you have a fitting for tonight's gala."
980,"Then at 8:45, a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Masum, to Brazilian President Temer about deforestation issues."
981,UK Foreign Secretary Green to discuss your tour of Scotland in a few weeks.
982,a call with New York Times to comment on POTUS' latest Instagram attack on Prime Minister Bharath of Kashtar.
983,"At 5:45, we're meeting with the head of Sweden's Diplomatic Protocol, Ingrid Minervudottir, to discuss tonight's schedule."
984,Okay. And then after that?
985,"Also, Parker Wembley keeps trying to get  some face time with you."
986," Oh, God."
987,"Parker can wait. Okay, Fred. Go."
988,"Yeah, sure. Um..."
989,"So, uh, you know, based on what we were talking about last night, I just took a stab at the whole speech, basically."
990,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CLICKS TONGUE)</font> That's good."
991, Thank you.
992, This part isn't.
993,"Okay, well, you said you didn't want to sound too angry."
994,I also don't want to sound like I have a head injury.
995,"Okay. Uh, I'll go change it."
996,Great. Thanks.
997,"Okay, here we go."
998," <font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font>  So... All right."
999,Fred.
1000,Yeah?
1001,Do you have any grownup clothes to wear tonight?
1002,"I was gonna... I was thinking of zipping this up all the way, like to here."
1003,"That's kind of a little more... It's, like, slightly more buttoned up."
1004,"You know what, Madam Secretary, I would be delighted to dress Fred for tonight."
1005,"Thank you, Maggie. I'd be thrilled to have you dress me for tonight's event."
1006,What a fun adventure.
1007,Get a little makeover.
1008,"All right, have a good one."
1009,"Thank you, Fred."
1010,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Why, thank you."
1011,"<font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: ...and then it's saying hello, you'll sit down, we'll have dinner,  I'll pull you up..."
1012, Where's Flarsky?
1013,Why are we waiting?
1014,"What, is he doing his hair?"
1015,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Um..."
1016,Oh.
1017," <font color""ff8000"">TOM</font>: What the..."
1018," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE LAUGHING)</font> What the fuck are you wearing?"
1019,She bought me this shit. Okay?
1020,It's a traditional Swedish suit.
1021,I don't see another fucking Swede up in here dressed like this.
1022,It's all I could do on such short notice.
1023,"You just take the jacket off, it's going to make it better."
1024,It's just... Make it look...
1025,"Oh, my God."
1026,Better with the jacket on? Great.
1027,"Razzing the new guy, I get it."
1028,"Fuck you, Maggie."
1029,Calm the Smurf down.
1030,Bring a fucking suit next time.
1031,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CLEARS THROAT)</font> Did you like the speech?"
1032,"Yes, the speech is good."
1033,"Oh, you're going to have to stay way back there, Fred."
1034,"Just stay back, Flarsky."
1035,Okay? She's got to focus.
1036,On what?
1037,Getting India and China to agree to be a part of this initiative.
1038,They haven't even agreed to be a part of it yet?
1039,They will. We just have to sort out a few details.
1040,We just wrote a whole speech about how they're onboard already.
1041,"Don't worry, Fred."
1042,"You just stay here and make sure nobody from Candy Land needs their car parked, okay?"
1043,I don't know why you needed a writer. Those are sick burns.

1049,"No, thank you."
1050,I'm working right now.
1051,"And you know you are, too."
1052,I do know that.
1053,"But you dressed me like Cap'n Crunch's Grindr date, so I'm going to drink to make you uncomfortable."
1054,"Honestly, Fred, your entire life makes me uncomfortable."
1055,"<font color""ff00ff"">(MAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)</font> <font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: Oh no, fuck me."
1056,"<font color""ff00ff"">(MAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)</font>  Yes."

1063,"Hey, we're making a few revisions to the speech."
1064, What?
1065," So we're losing the ""Seas"" part, so go cut that, and then brainstorm a couple of other funny lines for the ""Trees"" section, okay?"
1066,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
1067,"Losing the ""Seas"" part, why?"
1068,Because India wouldn't go for it.
1069,So we had to pivot.
1070,"That's not a pivot, that's a third of the whole fucking shit."
1071,Are you kidding me?
1072,"That's it, it's just gone?"
1073," Yeah, it's gone."
1074, And there's nothing we can do?
1075,No. And you don't have to worry about it.
1076,Just go over to the computer.
1077,Start typeytyping.
1078,"Well, no."
1079,I'm not gonna do that.
1080,"So you quit, resignation accepted."
1081,I will rewrite the speech.
1082,"Oh, the fuck you will!"

1091,Because I will not have you damage the integrity of my writing!
1092,The integrity of your writing?
1093,"You're a punchup writer, you're not Maya Angelou!"
1094,What is going on?
1095,"What's going on with you, bruh?"
1096,"Did you just call me ""bruh""?"
1097, She's the secretary of state.
1098, Is he high?
1099,"<font color""ff8000"">MAGGIE</font>: He is wasted, but he's also just stupid."
1100,"Meet me in the conference room, I'll handle this."
1101,"What's the deal, Fred?"
1102,What's the deal? What's the deal?
1103,What are...
1104,"The only reason I'm here is 'cause you told me you cared about this shit, and in the time I come out here to have a smoke, you fucking got rid of a massive element of the whole thing."
1105,I got two out of three.
1106,I only lost one.
1107,That one was the seas.
1108,It covers 75% of the planet!
1109, It's a pretty big one!
1110, Bring down your voice.
1111,You know why I'm upset?
1112,This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.
1113,And I even said it.
1114,I said it in your office.
1115,I don't want to write for some bullshit politician.
1116,I wanted to write for you.
1117,Because I thought you cared about this shit.
1118,"Until you're running the game, you have to play the game."
1119,"Well, then, by the time you win the game, you don't know who's scoring touchdowns on whose nets, and you don't know who's hitting home runs in whose fucking end zones!"
1120, What are you talking about?
1121, I don't know sports.
1122,Let me try it with food.
1123,You wanna open a restaurant.
1124,But all you got is chopsticks.
1125,"No! I don't have time for this, okay?"
1126,"If you want to quit, then just fucking quit."
1127, I don't give a shit.
1128," Yeah, you don't give a shit."
1129," No, I don't."
1130," You used to fucking give a shit, but now you don't give a shit about anything."
1131,You cared more about recycling in high school than you do this shit and it's very disappointing to me.
1132,Fuck this.
1133,I've got a speech to give.
1134,"Oh, yeah, good luck giving it."
1135,It's on my computer in the snow.
1136,"I have copies, you idiot."
1137,"You just threw your computer in the snow, that's it."
1138,"Oh, no! Shit!"
1139,"Oh, Goddamn it!"
1140,It's soaked! I need a bowl of rice!
1141,I need a big bowl of rice!
1142,Goddamn it!

1146,Wow.
1147,I've never seen anything like that.
1148,"No, I..."
1149,"I've seen pictures of it, but I never..."
1150,actually...
1151,"I never saw it. <font color""ff00ff"">(SNIFFLES)</font> Are you crying right now?"
1152,It's pretty.
1153,Yeah.

1156,"If you ever pull some shit like that again, I'll have you thrown in Gitmo."
1157,"Yes, Madam Secretary. I'm sorry."
1158,You better hope this fucking speech goes over well.
1159,I've often gravitated toward the underdog.
1160,The band of misfits who fight back against the bullies.
1161,"In high school, I would talk about the underdog a lot."
1162,"And I would often find myself on a soapbox, rambling on and on about the injustices of the world."
1163,"Which makes you extremely popular, especially when everybody would rather be watching."
1164,"Beverly Hills, 90210."
1165,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ALL LAUGH)</font> But that is why I am happy to announce an initiative that would make my 16yearold self proud."

1167,...turns out she has always been an Andrea Zuckerman in the body of a Kelly Taylor.
1168, Hey.
1169, Hi.
1170,"Oh, wow, you shaved your neck."
1171,I did. I cleaned it up.
1172,Got my whole back.
1173,Went all the way down.
1174,Looks good.
1175,"Trying to make a good impression, I guess. Anyway... I, uh..."
1176,"I just wanted to apologize to you, again, for acting a little crazy, you know."
1177,"I'm gonna... I'm going to really try to tone it down and not, you know, make you risk global, uh, humiliation."
1178,Good. Great.
1179,"Also, I googled speech writing and it was actually very informative."
1180,"What I learned was that in order to write better for you, I should kinda get to know you better and get in your head, and everything I already know about you, I kinda used on the first speech."
1181,"So, what I did was I wrote a ton of questions that will maybe help me capture your voice, if you have a minute."
1182,I actually have seven.
1183,"Seven. Okay, great."
1184,Yeah. I'll take it.
1185, All right.

1187,"<font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLES)</font> Um..."

1189,Just like... What are you into?
1190,What kind of shit you into?
1191,"Well, this is pretty much it."
1192,"I mean, secretary of state stuff."
1193,Do you have any hobbies?
1194,Anything? Do you watch TV?
1195,Do you watch Game of Thrones or anything like that?
1196,"Oh, I'm fully aware of what happened in every season of Game of Thrones."
1197,Because you watch it?
1198,Because I read synopses on every episode.
1199,That can't actually work.
1200,"I couldn't believe when Khaleesi's dragon <font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> came back as a White Walker."
1201,"<font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> Whoa!"
1202, See?
1203, What about movies?
1204,Do you watch movies?
1205,Synopses of all the award contenders.

1307, No. No.
1308, No.

1310,Did I read that in some shitty tabloid that you guys were dating?
1311,Maybe it's not true.
1312,"No, I'm sure you did. It's..."
1313,"They like to write about it, but no. I..."
1314,"We're not, we... We flirt."
1315, Yeah. Okay.
1316, Kind of.
1317,It's weird. We made out once.
1318,Dope.
1319,You asked.
1320,"No, hey! I've hooked up with my fair share of world leaders, too."
1321,I 69'd Fidel Castro once.
1322,You thought his beard was big.
1323,Um...
1324,But how does that work with you?
1325,"Do you, like..."

1327,Uh... Yeah. I date.
1328,"Generally, you know, with people who have similar lifestyles to me."
1329,People who travel a lot.
1330,It's hard to keep those things alive. I...
1331,"I mean, who wants to follow me around the world and hope I have five minutes to be affectionate?"
1332, Yeah.
1333," And honestly, guys don't really want to date women who are more powerful than them."
1334,"They think they do, but..."
1335,It's a dick shriveller.
1336, Oof.
1337, Mmmhmm.

1472, That was weird.
1473," We both said, ""Oh, boy"" when we came..."

1489, No.
1490, He's so happy about it.

1509,"<font color""ff00ff"">(ON RADIO)</font> These helicopters are scary."

1569,Fuck! Shit!
1570,That was fucking very clever.
1571,"Jesus, well, you know what, yes."
1572,Okay. We're sexing one another down.
1573, So?
1574, Ew.
1575,"Honestly, it's probably weirder to me than it is to you."
1576,"Look, I can't believe I have to say this, but just so you know, there's no way the two of you work."
1577,Why would you say that?
1578,You don't know that.
1579,"The public will never accept the two of you together, so neither will she."
1580,"Honestly, Fred, it doesn't matter if you get it or you don't, 'cause the truth is, she is going to realize it for the both of you, then you'll have your heart broken."

1701,We need you to revise it.
1702,Sir?
1703,We need you to kill the trees.
1704,Why would he do that?
1705,Because he's funded by a bunch of fucking rich assholes and I probably pissed one of them off.
1706,Can I just say the optics of this are actually not that different?
1707,The initiative still has the same name.

1728,I fuckin' hate it.
1729,"I mean, what's the point?"
1730,"Every time I do something, it just gets undone."
1731,I'm sorry.
1732,I just wanna be a normal person and not give a fuck about anything just like the rest of the world.
1733,"Yeah, most people don't give a shit about anything."
1734,I bet it's really nice.
1735,That's what I want.
1736,I don't know how to give that to you.
1737,Let's get fucked up.
1738,Fucked up?
1739, Yeah.
1740, Like a few beers fucked up or more than that fucked up?
1741,Like super fucked up.
1742,I want to smoke a Molly with you.
1743,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SNICKERS)</font> What?"
1744,"That's not, um..."
1745,"That's not how you take it, but..."
1746,How do you take it?
1747,It's a pill.
1748,You take it in your mouth.
1749,But I don't know if you wanna do it.
1750,Why not?
1751,I just don't know if it's a good idea.
1752,"As your boss, I'm ordering you to get me a Molly."
1753,"Oh, man."
1754, You good?
1755," <font color""ff00ff"">(ECHOING)</font> I don't feel anything."
1756,You don't feel it?
1757,"No, I don't feel a fucking thing."
1758,Ooh! Wow.
1759, Whoa!
1760," ""Whoa"" is right."
1761,Holy fuck...
1762,"<font color""ff00ff"">(GRUNTING)</font> No!"
1763,My jaw feels really weird.
1764,"Yeah, that's the drugs."
1765,Drugs love a jaw.
1766, I want more.
1767," No, no, no, no."
1768,Maybe in like an hour.

1773,I know I've been like...
1774,"I've been, like, playing it pretty cool."
1775,"Like I've probably been a little hard to read, and I've been acting kinda, like, aloof, maybe like I don't care that much."
1776,But I don't wanna do that anymore.
1777,I really like you.
1778,You haven't been playing it cool at all.
1779,You just followed me into the bathroom.
1780,"Yeah, to talk."
1781," I really like you, too!"
1782, Really?
1783, Yeah!
1784, Yeah!

1792,How much longer is this Molly stuff gonna last?
1793,We just reupped.
1794,"You kept saying you wanted to take more, so we did."
1795,So we have another maybe four or five hours.
1796,Yeah. Why?
1797,I'm in so much trouble.
1798,"<font color""ff8000"">FRED</font>: What's happened?"
1799, I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
1800, What's happening?
1801,Are they out of water?
1802,One of our U2s went down while performing a standard flyover in Kashtari airspace.
1803,"The pilot was able to eject, but it appears he was taken by the Kashtari military."
1804,"Thank you, General."
1805,"Prime Minister Bharath is refusing to return the pilot to United States custody, personally hurt by the many insults hurled at him by POTUS."
1806,Good job. All right.
1807,"<font color""ff00ff"">(INHALES, EXHALES)</font> It's gonna be okay in there, right?"

1817,I hear we have a situation here?
1818,One that we both probably want resolved...
1819,very quickly.
1820,"You're not going to bully me this time, Madam Secretary."
1821,Your man will stay here until your president personally apologizes to me.
1822,Over Instagram.
1823, He won't do that.
1824," Yeah, no. Yes..."
1825," <font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> Yo."
1826, Yes?
1827,Can I level with you?
1828,Can I fill you in on something?
1829,Go ahead.
1830,"Me and Charlotte, we're fucked up right now. We're on drugs."
1831,"First of all, I don't wanna talk about that."
1832,Why? We can't talk about the Dr...

1841,What is happening?
1842,We're on drugs right now.
1843,So you're admitting that the United States government ordered these planes to spy on my country?
1844, No.
1845," <font color""ff00ff"">(MOUTHS WORD)</font> No! No! Of course not!"
1846,That's what it sounded like.
1847,Face it. You have no leverage here.
1848,"Match his aggression, Madam."
1849,It's the only way out of this.
1850,I don't know.
1851,He seems really fucking pissed off.
1852,"Well, get more fucking pissed."
1853,Let him know who's really in charge.
1854,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SLAMS DESK)</font> <font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> Oh, my God, that really hurt."

1858,"God, are those Gauloises?"
1859,"Just, I'm so... Just..."
1860,I'm just gonna bum one.
1861,Just give me one sec. Don't worry.
1862,Bharath.
1863, Hello?
1864, Listen.
1865,Mmm. Mmm.
1866,"You and I are in the same boat, my friend."
1867, How is that the case?
1868, We both have to deal with my boss.
1869,And we both think he's an asshole.
1870,You also think he's an asshole?
1871,"Oh, my God, he's such an asshole."
1872,"His stupid fucking TV show was, like, good for three episodes and then it just didn't make any sense."
1873,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> Fuck, it feels good to say that."
1874,"<font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERING)</font> Listen."
1875,You need to keep this on the real DL.
1876,We both know that the US does not negotiate with terrorists.
1877,But...
1878,we do negotiate with homies.
1879,"So if you give us our guy back, I'm gonna hook you up with a sweet aid package."
1880,"So not only do you not have to keep a guy hostage, which is a pretty shitty thing to do."
1881,"I mean, I've done it myself."
1882,Don't tell anybody.
1883,Super classified.
1884,It sucks. I hate it.
1885,Yeah. So...
1886,why don't we instead...
1887,save a ton of lives?
1888,"I mean, that's pretty fucking awesome, right?"
1889,I think this is a really good idea.
1890,What do you say?
1891,Ma'am.
1892,"Hostage saved, motherfuckers!"
1893,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You did it!
1894,She did it! She did it! She did it!
1895,"I'm here with Secretary of State Charlotte Field who, after a tense and complicated negotiation with Kashtar, has secured the release of the pilot of the US spy plane that went down over Kashtari airspace."
1896,"I know, right? <font color""ff00ff"">(WHISPERS)</font> So crazy."
1897,"This is all in the midst of the success of your environmental initiative, which I understand has secured the support of 100 countries."
1898," Yes, um..."
1899, Ooh. Sore subject.
1900,"I'm very happy to announce that not only do I have the support of those 100 countries, but the president himself called me personally just to tell me how psyched he is about this initiative."
1901, Did he call? Did he call?
1902, That didn't happen.
1903,"...don't change a word, especially the part, uh, with the trees."
1904, That's a lie.
1905," So, all in all, I'm just..."
1906,I kinda feel like I'm just kinda crushing it right now.
1907, Thank you so much.
1908, Thank you.
1909, So...

1921," <font color""ff00ff"">(KNOCKING)</font>  Yep?"
1922, Can I talk to you for a second?
1923, Of course.
1924, We got new polling I thought I'd share.
1925, All right.
1926,It feels like everything is kinda falling into place for us.
1927,So we thought we'd dig deeper and make sure there's no surprises.
1928, Why are you acting so weird?
1929, It's good.
1930,We got some really helpful feedback.
1931,From the public.
1932,"So we asked a thousand constituents how they would feel  if, say, Princess Di..."
1933," <font color""ff00ff"">(CHARLOTTE)</font> Hmm."

1939,were to start dating Danny DeVito.
1940, I see where you're going with this.
1941, Pretty negative reaction.
1942,Or if Jennifer Lawrence were to start dating this potato in a teal windbreaker.
1943," <font color""ff00ff"">(BUZZES)</font>  They'd be very upset."
1944," He did a lot of work, and I..."
1945," Well, but, can I just finish?"
1946,"No, that's, like, a lot of..."
1947,I get it.
1948,"Madam Secretary, I have no desire to limit your romantic life."
1949,Good.
1950,But the optics of you and Fred will make a presidential run very challenging.
1951,Fred is a journalist.
1952,Who's written some extremely fuckedup stuff.
1953,"No, that's exposed some really fuckedup stuff."
1954,"And I just want to know for myself, you're comfortable with putting everything on the line for a hookup?"
1955,"Oh, my God. <font color""ff00ff"">(CHUCKLING)</font> Why are we having this conversation?"
1956,This is insane. I don't have to explain myself to you.
1957,I'm sorry.
1958,I really don't understand this.
1959,"I fucking love you, Charlotte."
1960,I want you to be happy.
1961,"But more than that, I want you to be in charge, to be president."
1962,For the sake of the future of our country.
1963,"Look, there's another option."
1964,There's a guy who works for the Secret Service whose job it is to handle the mistresses...
1965,"Maggie, you're gonna have to stop."
1966,There are a series of tunnels in the White House that Woodrow Wilson...
1967,That's enough.
1968,Fred is not an idea that I am floating by you for your approval.
1969,And you're getting very close to crossing a line.
1970,Okay. Got it.
1971,"Good night, Madam Secretary."
1972,"<font color""ff8000"">TV REPORTER</font>: ...would have a huge impact on young women."

2002,"Yeah, uh, aside from getting into film, I'm looking to use my connections as president to expand my investment portfolio."
2003,"Sort of like an Ashton Kutcher type thing, you know."
2004,"I mean, that guy's killing it with acting and investing..."
2005,I think what the president is trying to say is that the server farm we want to build in Alaska is sitting on ten miles of land which will now be protected by your initiative.
2006,Move your server farm.
2007,We want to build it in Alaska. There's plenty of room for expansion.
2008,"Charlotte, I'm surprised that it's come to this."
2009,You're usually so agreeable.
2010,But I watched you undermine me on TV the other day.
2011,TV of all places.
2012,That's my medium. All right?
2013,You used TV against me!
2014,That was your first mistake!

2049,And now it's happening because of me.
2050, Do I get a publicist?
2051, No.
2052, Do I do a publicity tour?
2053, Stop.
2054, Do we have a press conference?

2057,What?
2058,"We scratch the tree thing, and I have a real shot at becoming president."
2059,And some... billionaire...
2060,"motherfucker gets to blackmail you, using me..."
2061,"doing something that everybody does, out of a policy that you cared about since you were in middle school."
2062,"Since I've known you, you've cared about this."
2063,And now you're just gonna get rid of it?
2064,I'm trying to compromise here for a bigger goal.
2065," Well, I don't think you should right now."
2066," Oh, my God!"
2067,Of course you don't think I should.
2068,"You never compromise for anything in your life, which gives you the perfect excuse to fail."
2069,"Well, it's better than maybe bending over backwards for anyone who asks, to the point that you don't even know why you're doing this shit anymore!"
2070,"In my world, in order to achieve what I'm trying to achieve,  I have to compromise."
2071," Oh, why? 'Cause you're a woman?"
2072," Yeah, motherfucker."
2073," Okay, that makes sense."
2074,And because I'm not giving up everything I've ever wanted just because it doesn't live up to your moral code.
2075,I don't care if this tape comes out.
2076,I really don't.
2077," Oh, my God, Fred."
2078, I'll be okay.
2079,You don't have to do this for me.
2080,You're not doing this for me.
2081,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SCOFFS)</font> Obviously."
2082,Look... you and I both know the woman who stands beside the guy who's coming on his face gets way more scrutiny than the guy who's actually coming on his face.
2083,"Don't know if that's happened enough for there to be a precedent for it, but..."
2084,"So, who knows? Maybe that won't be the case this time. Who knows?"
2085,Maybe people will think it's romantic. I'm jerking off to you.
2086,You don't know how people are gonna react.
2087,I'm not taking that risk.
2088,"<font color""ff00ff"">(SIGHS)</font> I can't do it."

2090,So the video doesn't come out.
2091,What happens to us?
2092,"I was talking to Maggie, and..."
2093,she knows this consultant who could scrub your history.
2094,We could make sure nothing else like this pops up and surprises us.
2095,And then we just...
2096,"we work on your image, and we figure out how we want to present ourselves as a couple to the public."
2097,That's all.
2098, Okay.
2099, Okay.
2100,"How long will it take, do you think, to... to create an image of me that we can present to the public?"
2101,Just through the first couple of months of... of the campaign.
2102,You think?
2103,"But you don't know that, right?"
2104,It could take longer than that.
2105,"In a couple of months, you could find that it's not a good moment to introduce a new boyfriend, right?"
2106,And then we'd have to wait a couple more months.
2107,"I don't know how long it's gonna take, Fred."
2108,"And then meanwhile, you're pretending not to date me."
2109,"And you're scrubbing my Internet history, so all my articles are gone."
2110,"And you, like, sneak me around like I'm Marilyn Monroe and you're JFK?"
2111,Is that what we're talking about?
2112,I just want to be clear that's what we're talking about.
2113,And we have to do that because I'm...
2114,not right.
2115,"And then once we present us to the world, we present a version of me that isn't..."
2116,actually me?
2117,Yeah.

2126,She has no moral compass.
2127,"She's working with Democrats one day, Republicans the next fucking day."
2128,What's wrong with working with Democrats and Republicans?
2129,That's the whole country.
2130,"Uh, yeah, except fuck Republicans, I guess is the problem with that."
2131,"Speaking as an American, shouldn't you see both sides?"
2132,Yeah.

2142,Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And being in charge of your own destiny.
2143, Republican shit.

2154,I'm the same dude from two minutes ago. Your best friend.

2177,"You mean, like, 'cause I'm black?"
2178,"That's what I thought, yeah."
2179,That might be. But that don't mean what you said ain't racist.
2180, You're right.
2181," Yeah, I know I'm right!"
2182, Fuck.
2183, That's racist as shit!
2184,"All right, dude, I love you, man."
2185,But you're very judgmental.
2186,"They don't want politics to get into this, because you've never really been good at looking at shit from other people's perspective, Fred."
2187,I know.
2188,It might explain why you haven't been able to look at this through Charlotte's eyes.
2189,I'm sorry you couldn't be who you are around me and had to hide your true self.
2190, That's really fucked up.
2191," It's all right, man."

2431,We have the beautiful Lady Bird Johnson's portrait.
2432,And that leads us into my portrait.

2441, There we are.
2442, You're wearing mittens.
