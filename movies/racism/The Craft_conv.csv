319,"TABBY: I mean, it's new to us too."
320,We've never thrown a grownass man.

322,"Yeah, and, like, we all thought it at the same time."
323,"Wait, what?"
324,Tell me you didn't think about throwing his ass off of you.
325," Yeah, I did."
326," LOURDES: Well, so did we!"
327,"And then, bam!"
328,"And that's just stage one, moving stuff with our minds."
329,"LOURDES: Or people, I guess, in Timmy's case."
330, If he even counts as a person.
331, True that. Anything.
332,Stage two? That's what went down in detention.
333,That was so sick!
334,And you said we couldn't do it.
335,"Stage three, we'll get to soon enough."
336,"LOURDES: Let's surprise her, though."
337,"Stage four, shapeshifting."
338,Shapeshifting.
339,"You know, the power to take on a different form?"
340,"And if we get to stage four, I'm lowkey turning myself into Kristen Stewart."
341,Don't judge.
342,She's a Twilight stan.
343,"Point is, we've never made it past stage one."
344,And then in walks Robert Pattinson.

347,"I'm sorry, can you guys just slow down?"

353,FRANKIE: What about your mom?
354,Is she a witch?
355,She's a therapist from New Jersey.
356,It's gotta come from somewhere.
357,"Yeah, you see, we've been looking for our fourth for a while now."
358,"We thought we could form a coven, just us three..."
359,It doesn't work like that.
360,"No, because, you see, we each have an element that corresponds to a direction."
361,I'm fire.
362, Air.
363, Earth.
364,"So you've got North, South, East..."
365,"But West, that was a tough get."
366,LOURDES: And now you're here.
367,You're water.
368,You're West.
369,"Yeah, in order for us to have, like, maximum power, we all need to be on our directions."
370,"The term is ""calling the corners."" Okay. Um..."
371,"This is a lot, but I am listening and also working through a lowlevel panic attack."
372,"Okay, we know that this is probably a lot to take in right now."
373,But you shouldn't run from your power.
374,None of us should.
375,That's what my mom always says.
376,"""Your difference is your power."" Oh, then Mom's cool."
377,"So, what do you say?"
378,âªâªâª Lily.
379,"Oh, my God, Frankie."
380,Give me your hand.
381,Come on.
382,Will you be our fourth?
383,"Come on, I got bad knees."
384,Her ACLs are gonna tear.
385,You had me at shapeshifting into Kristen Stewart.
386,"SQUEALING, CHEERING  She said yes! She said yes."
387," Oh, my God!"
388,Why didn't you just say yes originally?
389,"I mean, witchcraft in general is such a charged word."
390,We literally house babies in our stomachs.
391,That's some Ridley Scott shit.
392,We have superpowers without even trying.
393,"I mean, not all of us can do that, but..."
394,"Shit. You know, point taken."
395,"My bad, Lou."
396,"Yeah, it's all good."
397,Y'all know trans girls got our own magick anyway.
398,Word.
399,"They do, they do."
400,That's why covens have always been so important.
401,Because half the battle of having powers is believing you do.
402,What are we doing?
403,"Well, now that we got our fourth, we need to take our coven for a test drive."
404,"âªâªâª FRANKIE: Whenever we do a spell, we always cast a circle first."
405,"Think of it as, you know, making a container to hold all of our energies."
406,And to keep the bad shit out.
407,Breathe.
408,ALL BREATHING DEEPLY Listen to the sound of the trees breathing along with you.
409,Feel yourself rooted into the ground and into this moment.

432,That's a little extreme.
433,"We don't wanna hurt him, though, right?"
434,Why not?
435,"No, she's right."
436,Hexing is serious.
437,So is harassment.
438,Everybody relax.
439,We're not hexing him.
440,We'll just cast a spell to make him less of a garbage person.

453,"LOURDES: Naw, this boy has a Ouija board?"

1004,What the hell is this?
1005,Where did you find that?
1006,You never told me?
1007,Huh?
1008,Lily.
1009,It's complicated.
1010,"No, it's really not."
1011,"It's, like, a simple conversation that should have happened a long time ago."
1012,No. You don't...
1013,Hold on. Hold on. No.
1014,Don't touch me!
1015,"Oh, God."
1016,What?
1017,Say it!
1018,It wasn't entirely up to me.
1019,"Oh, really? Who else would it have been up to, Mom?"
1020,It was your birth mother.
1021,"It was the one condition that she had, that I never reveal to you, and she's..."
1022,"She didn't want you to know that you were adopted, and I made a promise to her and..."
1023,It was such a...
1024,"God, it was a complicated..."
1025,Why would she want that?
1026,'Cause she...
1027,She had undergone some trauma.
1028,I was assigned to her at the crisis center here and...
1029,"Baby, I'm so sorry."
1030,"âªâªâª SINGER VOCALIZING You guys, I need to talk to you."
1031,I don't think that's a good idea.
1032,Listen to me.
1033,Please.
1034,There's no one else I can trust.
1035,Fine.
1036, Lily.
1037, Don't.
1038,You all right?
1039,PEOPLE MURMURING âªâªâª I need to take her away from here.
1040,I need to put her first.
1041,"LOURDES: You guys, she's not gonna harm anyone."
1042,She already did.
1043,She's just going through some shit.
1044,"Yeah, well, what happened to our number one rule of the craft?"
1045,"If a person is a danger to herself or others, they will be bound."
1046,She used her powers irresponsibly.
1047,End of story.
1048,"But, like, are we any better, though?"
1049,"I mean, like, what we did to Timmy."
1050,That wasn't consensual either.
1051,"Well, then maybe we should bind ourselves too."
1052,We are bound to each other and bound from magick.
1053,âªâªâª We prevent ourselves from doing harm.
1054,We relinquish our powers from this day forth.
1055,ALL: So mote it be.
1056,Let's go.
1057,What?
1058,You were right.
1059,I never should've brought you here.
1060,But I need you to agree to one thing.
1061,"Whatever this is, whatever's happening here..."
1062,I need you to stop it.
1063,What do you mean?
1064,I should've told you.
1065,"Not just about your birth mother, but about..."
1066,About these...
1067,These powers.
1068,"Whatever you call them, Lily, they're..."
1069,You knew?
1070,I'm sorry.
1071,I was warned...
1072,that your legacy was a curse.
1073,"And that the second they came online, I would have to stop them in their tracks, so Lily..."
1074,"Lily, please."
1075,Honey...
1076,let me take the burden for you.
1077,Let me take your curse so you don't have to carry it.
1078,"It has been so painful, you can't imagine..."
1079,to watch you understand that you were different and not know why.
1080,Now you can see why your difference...
1081,is dangerous.
1082,"But I need you to say it with me, Lily."
1083,In the name of Manon...
1084,I give you my power.
1085,You can trust me.
1086,I'm your mother.
1087,âªâªâª My mother would never tell me my difference is dangerous.
1088,GRUNTS âªâªâª Guys?
1089,"""He..."
1090,killed...
1091,"me."" You guys."
1092,Who is it?
1093,"LOURDES: ""T..."
1094,I...
1095,M...
1096,M...
1097,"Y."" GASPING, WHIMPERING âªâªâª SHOUTS Uhoh."
1098,Those don't seem to be working anymore.
1099,Thanks to your socalled friends.
1100,"You see, that's the thing about girls with power, Lily."
1101,They're always too weak not to use it against each other.
1102,What do you want from me?
1103,That's an excellent question.
1104,"Oh, you see, Lily...."
1105,I want your power.
1106,Where's my mother?
1107,Which one?
1108,Helen.
1109,She's tied up at the moment.
1110,Your real mom....
1111,"Well, she's tied up too, in a different way."
1112,You're a lot like her.
1113,"You know, she fought it at first, but eventually she gave in."
1114,"You see, Lily, in order to gain a witch's power, she has to give them up voluntarily."
1115,So you do have a choice here.
1116,We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
1117,You'll have to kill me first.
1118,SIGHS So the easy way.
1119,âªâªâª SINGERS VOCALIZING You guys came for me.
1120,"There's no I in ""sisterhood,"" baby."
1121,"There is definitely an I in ""sisterhood."" FRANKIE: You get my meaning."
1122, What we were saying was....
1123, We're sorry.
1124,"We love you, and we unbind you, Lily."
1125,Guys.
1126,You girls ought to be careful in the woods at night.
1127,A lot of weirdos out here.
1128,"We are the weirdos, mister."
1129,SINGERS VOCALIZING SCREAMS  SCREAMS  BOTH GASP GRUNTING No!
1130,"You see, Lily, power is order."
1131,It belongs in the hands of those who understand it.
1132,It's been that way for thousands of years.
1133,Timmy's a good example of that.
1134,Until you tried to make him in your own image.
1135,So then I had to kill him...
1136,âªâªâª to restore the order.
1137,Because we are not in your image.
1138,We are your rulers and kings.
1139,"The thing is, Lily, you got yourself here."
1140,"But you're playing with fire, and I'm gonna watch you burn."
1141,TABBY: South.
1142,LOURDES: East.
1143,FRANKIE: North.
1144,Where do you think you're going?
1145,West.

1166,"But, also, not really because we almost did die."
