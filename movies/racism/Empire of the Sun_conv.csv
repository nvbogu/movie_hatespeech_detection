307,"Don't worry about Frank. He always eats after me, don't you, Frank?"
308,"I always eat after you, Basie."
309,Because I think for us both.
310,"Jim, chew your food."
311,Chew every mouthful six times to get the benefit.
312,"Frank, we might do all right in one of those camps."
313,It doesn't look like we'll be leaving Shanghai soon.
314,"You're a tired boy, Jim."
315,Where am I gonna sleep?

352,"Say, what about a little money?"
353,I did see some money.

580,Can you get me a sewing needle?
581,I'll try.
582,What's that?
583,It's a trap.
584,Get out of here.
585,It's all right. You're almost one of us. You see that Mustang?
586,It's the Cadillac of the sky.
587,That's right. B29s too.
588,B29s?
589,The Superfortress.
590,A hemisphere defense weapon.
591,Where from?
592,Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in bombing range now.
593,Tokyo?
594,Time to think of going home soon.
595,We'll have to leave the camp?
596,"One side feeds you, the other tries to kill you."
597,It's turned around. It's all timing.
598,Tell me when it's time? Promise?
599,Promise.
600,It'd be simpler to live here.
601,You've the British dorm to go to when they're sick of you.
602,They are sick of me.
603,The British dorm's so lethargic.
604,Will you let me?
605,This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
606,I'll have pheasant.
607,Pheasant?
608,Just made the traps.
609,Works like a noose.
610,Stick out your arm. Neat.
611,"I've seen no pheasants, have you?"
612,Outside the wire.
613,Which wire?
614,Our wire.
615,That close?
616,"At the edge of the airfield, across the canal."
617,An American initiative.
618,Whoever delivers gets the gravy.
619,"How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?"
620,I brought Amy Matthews back to life for a minute.
621,That's worth a Reader's Digest.
622,Increase your word power.
623,I got a new one today: pragmatist.
624,Good word.
625,"If I set the traps, could I live here?"
626,It's a consideration.
627,Take me with you?
628,"Frankly, it's a tossup now between you and Dainty."
629,Take me!
630,Give me a good reason I should.
631,I'm your friend.
632,Chow truck's here.
633,Mr. Maxton keeps my place.
634,They cut the bloody rations!
635,Don't worry. I'll get yours.
636,You're just like your father.
637,They cut our rations in half!
638,I'll get ours. You sit down.
639,You cut the bloody rations!
640,You cut them!
641,"I've got yours, Mr. Maxton."
642,I've got some! I've got some!
643,"Hello, everybody."
644,Sit there.
645,"Eat it up, please."
646,The rations have been cut.
647,They're like animals.
648,"That's above average, but the trend is down."
649,"Must you, Jim?"
650,Sorry.
651,"Some of us will die just before we're saved, so use everything."
652,You'll miss this camp after the war.
653,Will I?
654,I'll locate my parents when the people in the camps come out.
655,I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
656,Think I'll get the reward?
657,What reward?
658,You told everyone.
659,I was much younger then.
660,Why'd the Japanese close the school?
661,To punish the grownups.
662,I wonder how you'll take to school in England.
663,It might be a bit strange.
664,The best teacher's the university of life.
665,For heaven's Could we finish our meal? We know your views on the university of life.
666,We should eat the weevils.
667,I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.
668,He said we need the protein.
669,"Yes, he's right."
670,We should eat all the weevils.
671,Do you believe in vitamins?
672,Strange child.
673,Perhaps it's time you moved into the men's dormitory.
674,You're not 12 anymore.
675,The Americans are over Nantao again.
676,They're bombing the Shanghai docks!
677,Coney Island pilots.
678,What was that?
679,A 29 going down.
680,A 200pounder.
681,That was close.
682,Too close for Nagata.
683,He won't go like that.
684,"What's happening, doctor?"
685,"Reprisals, and damned silly it is too."
686,Keep the patients from the windows.
687,"Yes, doctor."
688,Get away! This is British food!
689,Leave it alone!
690,This is our food. Get away!
691,Guards!
692,Mines. That was a mine. I told you.
693,Somebody lobbed a grenade.
694,"Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine."
695,I bet you there are no mines.
696,You can walk right through.
697,You got a bet.
698,So far so good.
699,He's seen something.
700,Jim's a black cat.
701,"That's a dead boy, Basie."
702,I'll give you odds.
703,My harmonica...
704,...and my next meal against your wristwatch.
705,"You're on, my friend."
706,I double my bet. My next two meals.
707,You'll lose a lot of weight.
708,What else you betting?
709,My Life.
710,Who's on the cover?
711,Two cigarettes on the kid!
712,Sunglasses on Nagata!
713,"Keep going, sarge!"
714,The lucky kid.
715,Cleaned me out.
716,"Hello, Jim."
717,"Hello, Nina."
718,Would you like a Hershey bar?
719,Yes.
720,"So would I, kid. You got one?"
721,"Don't let me down, kid."
722,You're an American now.
723,"How you doing, Frank?"
724,The river's east. You can go up the bank or up the middle...
725,"...or go north of east, but you gotta go across canals."
726,It doesn't say if it's buildings or what.
727,Where'd you get a map?
728,It's a cork and needle?
729,A compass that actually works.
730,Put it down.
731,Is it time?
732,"No, I'll tell you when."
733,You won't forget?
734,Fat chance.
735,I almost feel human.
736,"Without me, you'd have no compass."
737,"No, without you I wouldn't have the needle."
738,The best way is across the river.
739,"Jim, the curtain."
740,"Jim, come here."
741,You're in charge of my stuff.
742,You see this mosquito net?
743,See?
744,What does that tell you?
745,Rawlins is on the take.
746,"You're so clever, Basie."
747,Yeah.
748,Only cost me two batteries.
749,How are you feeling?
750,I've had worse.
751,I was beaten by a stoker once.
752,Were you a stoker?
753,Ship's steward. ShanghaiFrisco line.
754,Why did he beat you?
755,"ShanghaiFrisco will be the trip now. Huh, Jim?"
756,"Basie, where do you live?"
757,Here.
758,"No, I mean after the war."
759,Somewhere else.
760,"Until you find a place, you could live at Amherst Avenue."
761,I'd like you to come and meet my parents.
762,We could fill up the pool...
763,...and we'll eat three times a day.
764,"You're not feeling sorry for me, are you?"
765,"No one feels sorry for you, Basie."
766,That's right.
767,And you always eat first.
768,"You said it, kid."
769,I've been thinking about going upriver.
770,I know.
771,"Listen The plan is, we're going to get a sampan."
772,Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
773,Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.
774,"Are they proper pirates, you mean?"
775,"Let's just call them gentlemen of fortune, shall we?"
776,Did you ever see...
777,...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
778,Yes. On the news reels.
779,I saw them crash through a burning wall.
780,That's what I'm going to call our little outfit.
781,With 250 calibers...
782,...we are going to be the lords of the Yangtze.
783,"Actually, that may be a better name."
784,It's at the beginning and end of war that we have to watch out.
785,"In between, it's like a country club."
786,But you gotta know how to stay balanced and make the right friends.
787,Because this war is definitely winding down.
788,And after that?
789,After that...
790,"...I retire in luxury, start a barber college..."
791,What are you doing here?
792,I told you to look out for my stuff.
793,They were bigger than me.
794,Look who's here.
795,Heard they had you under the net.
796,"Stay with me, Johnny!"
797,"Get everybody inside, quick!"
798,Stay away from the building!
799,"Oh, God. Please, no!"
800,My husband's in there.
801,"Go! P51, Cadillac of the sky!"
802,"P51, Cadillac of the sky!"
803,"Jim, get off the roof!"
804,Horsepower!
805,"Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!"
806,P51! Aren't they beautiful?
807,Get down!
808,I touched them!
809,I felt their heat! I can taste them.
810,Oil and cordite.
811,Come back to the hospital.
812,Remember how we helped to build the runway?
813,"If we died like the others, our bones would be in the runway."
814,"In a way, it's our runway."
815,"No, it's their runway, Jim."
816,Try not to think so much.
817,Try not to think so much!
818,I can't remember what my parents look like.
819,I used to play bridge with my mother in her bedroom.
820,She used to comb her hair.
821,I'd watch her.
822,She had dark hair.
823,What's happening? What's happening?
824,The guards are leaving!
825,They're taking us upcountry.
826,They're moving us to Nantao!
827,The Japanese say there's food there.
828,One suitcase! We leave in one hour!
829,One suitcase!
830,One suitcase!
831,They've got our rations at Nantao.
832,He's gone.
833,Him and Dainty.
834,He's gone?
835,He's escaped!
836,He can't have. He promised me!
837,He knew it was time.
838,Where am I gonna go?
839,We'll all have to leave now.
840,He knew it was time.
841,He knew it was time.
842,Boy.
843,Difficult boy.
844,Just look...
845,...later here for escort!
846,"Jim, where's my husband?"
847,Where's Mr. Victor?
848,We are civilians. Listen to me.
849,I am a British doctor.
850,They are my responsibility!
851,"No, we must have rest and food."
852,"We're going upcountry, Jim."
853,Will there be food there?
854,There's none here.
855,"Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry."
856,"Come on, Jim."
857,Don't go. It's better here.
858,You'll die here.
859,"Don't worry, Mr. Maxton."
860,"Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor."
861,Surrender reached the Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.
862,He said Japan will endure the unendurable and suffer greatly.
863,The war minister and others committed suicide outside the palace.
864,"Japan is devastated, destroyed in spirit..."
865,...as Hiroshima and Nagasakihave been destroyed.
866,"More than 100,000 people were killed in two..."
867,"...singlebomb explosions, which ended the Pacifiic War."
868,The Russian declaration of war...
869,...has sent a million soldiers into Manchuria.
870,Tokyo was hit with a dawntodusk raid by 1500 B29 bombers.
871,But Japan's war was lost.
872,Her goal to create...
873,...a new empire incinerated in a flash...
874,...hotter than the sun.
875,Everyone stands in awe of the new superweapon.
876,Only a few scientists knew the power in splitting the uranium atom.
877,It reached us in a shock wave...
878,...and a white light: the atom bomb.
879,Each of the two bombs...
880,...had the power of Nagasakiis Japan's gateway to China...
881,...just 500 miles from Shanghai.
882,I saw that! I saw that! I saw that!
883,The white light.
884,I thought it was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven.
885,Bastard!
886,He gave me a mango.
887,I'll give you a whole fruit salad!
888,There's Frigidaires falling from the sky!
889,He was my friend!
890,He was a Jap!
891,The war's over!
892,You walked all the way here from Nantao Stadium?
893,What did you see? Rich pickings?
894,"Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars..."
895,...white pianos?
896,I learned a new word today.
897,Atom bomb.
898,It was like a white light in the sky.
899,Like God taking a photograph.
900,I saw it.
901,I can bring everyone back.
902,I can bring everyone back.
903,Everyone.
904,I can bring everyone back.
905,Everyone.
906,I can bring everyone back.
907,Didn't I teach you anything?
908,Yes!
909,You taught me people will do anything for a potato.
910,Three years with him?
911,Come on. I'll take you back to your dad.
912,You can retire and eat three meals a day.
913,"Kid, you want a Hershey bar?"
914,"Yes, please, Basie."
915,I surrender.
916,Come along. Off you go.
917,"Gather in, children. Come along."
