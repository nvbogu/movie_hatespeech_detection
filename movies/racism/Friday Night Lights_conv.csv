523,lf any ofyou have any doubt in your mind l don'twant you to walk through that door overthere.
524,You shouldn't have any doubt in your mind aboutwhatyou're supposed to do tonight and about how you're supposed to do it.
525,So let's take care of it!
526,Way to go.
527,SPORTSCASTER: Boobie Miles.

558,"Boobie Miles, from 35 yards out, scores a Mojo touchdown."
559,You're doing a greatjob.
560,Give me a smile.
561,"Thank you, Coach."
562,Boobie Miles is about as solid as you can ask for.
563,He ain't gonna smile.
564,Why not?
565,Why didn't he ever smile?
566,He's more internal.
567,Let me kick that extra point.
568,Not this time.
569,You did enough.
570,GAlNES: Come on.
571,"Chris Comer, you're going in."
572,"Comer, you're in the game."

585,No way.
586,GAlNES: Come on.
587,My goodness gracious.
588,Boobie.
589,"Water Bug, you can't come out here with no helmet."
590,You seen my helmet right here?
591,l can still go in.
592,You don't know where your helmet is!
593,What are you thinking?
594,Where did you putyour helmet?
595,Right there.
596,"Well, it ain't there!"
597,Do you not know thatyou play the game with a helmet on?
598,Sityourtail down right now!
599,SPORTSCASTER: He throws back to Miles.
600,Miles cuts to his right.
601,Bailey takes him down.
602,Was that a knee?
603,Could have been.
604,DOCTOR: Hold on. Hang on.
605,SPORTSCASTER: Winchell was still in there.
606,Billingsley was still in there.
607,Unfortunately the running back has been taken down hard and it looks like a knee could possibly...
608,Just gonna touch the kneecap here.
609,DOCTOR: Does it hurt over here on this side?
610,"Get up, Boobie."
611,DOCTOR: Let me take a look at this.
612,DCCTCR: It's definiteIy his ACL.
613,"I mean, it's a Iegitimate tear."
614,GAINES: Do you think he tore any cartiIage?
615,Maybe.
616,l could feel the knee catching.
617,What do you think?
618,"This kid, it's all about how he responds mentally."
619,l don't know.
620,"All right, everybody."
621,Listen up.
622,He's gonna be fine.
623,lt's not serious.
624,There's no tear.
625,He'll be back in a week.
626,That's the good news.
627,"Even better news, y'all played a great football game tonight."
628,A real good football game.
629,l'm real proud ofyou.
630,And Mike...

646,MAN 1 CN RADIC: We onIy got a minute and a haIf Ieft in the game.
647,We're Ieading by a good Iead.
648,He Ieaves the boy in there Iike that.
649,That makes no sense.
650,You gotta protect your best asset.
651,What's the matter with this man?
652,He couId've ruined the whoIe season for us right there.
653,"SPCRTSCASTER: We were up. We were winning big, and the boy stays in the game."
654,MAN 1: Yeah.
655,You don't need any more.
656,You don't need to accompIish any more.
657,MAN 2: I think Coach Gaines is a stupid idiot.
658,"WeII, he shouIdn't have put him in."
659,"I mean, we had a big Iead and everything."
660,I don't understand what that was aII about.
661,We can't do anything without Boobie.
662,We had the game won.
663,DOCTOR: l'm feeling some damage on the right side here.
664,"Well, can l play on Friday?"
665,l think you got a slight tear.
666,L.V.: Can he play?
667,"BOOBlE: Yeah, can l play?"
668,Can he play football?
669,Can l?
670,"You need to get up to Midland, get an MRl."
671,Can a MRl fix your knee?
672,REPCRTER: Is he the one pIayer you can't do without?
673,"Well, l never looked at it thatway."
674,A football team is not about one player ortwo players.
675,A football team is about the team.
676,"This is a unit, and that's the way we have to play."
677,lt's gonna be a challenge.
678,You are making some bad decisions!
679,You're playing like the village idiot.
680,You want people to think you're the village idiot?
681,"SPORTSCASTER 1: As the Eagles take down the Panthers, 496 and for Coach Gary Gaines play's gotta be back to the drawing board."
682,SPORTSCASTER 2: That's gonna be the word around town all week.
683,"Coach Gaines, what are you gonna do?"
684,The loss of Boobie Miles can not result in the loss ofthis season.
685,Hell of a game.
686,Give me the keys.
687,Way to take care of business.
688,"Give me the keys, Dad."
689,We...
690,"Wejust need a few more days, Coach, and we be back."
691,"You go into Midland, get that MRl?"
692,BOOBlE: l don't need nothing in Midland.
693,Those rich hillbillies ain't never seen nothing as pretty as Boobie Miles' knee.
694,Them MRl machines wouldn't knowwhat to do with it.
695,"He gonna bejust fine, Coach Gaines."
696,We gonna go back to the clinic but they already said there ain't no tears.
697,No tears?
698,Ain't no tear.
699,ls thatwhat they said?
700,"Yes, sir. We gonna go back for some double confirmation butwhen it come time to play Midland Lee, we be good to go."
701,That's good then.
702,MlKE: He designed his offense around one player.
703,We're dead.
704,CHAVEZ: We're not dead.
705,Wejust need to start throwing the football.
706,We're dead.
707,Dead. Pull it.
708,We gotta lighten up.
709,We're 17.
710,Do you feel 17?
711,l don't feel 17.
712,Pull it.
713,CHAVEZ: We will win State.
714,"Chavo, you're like a human piÃ±ata."
715,You getyour ass all beat on more than anybody l know and you just sit there and spit out candy.
716,MlKE: That's 'cause he's out of here.
717,He's got the grades.
718,"No matterwhat, ifwe win or lose, he knows he's getting out."
719,He's like the onefoot out thedoor man.
720,DON: You're gonna be drinking martinis...
721,Give me the gun.
722,MlKE: Eating lamb chops.
723,DON: Getting manicures.
724,CHAVEZ: You'rejustjealous.
725,DON: Removing yourfreaking shoes?
726,REPORTER: What's it like being the quarterback?
727,"l mean, this is a big responsibility for a 17yearold kid."
728,No! That is not acceptable!
729,"lt's sort of, l mean..."
730,"lt's not too bad, l know."
731,You are playing like a fool.
732,REPORTER: Do you think you can handle it?
733,lfyou got a receiver getting jammed inside whatwill you do with your brain?
734,"Yeah, hope so."
735,GAlNES: Whatwill your brain do?
736,You'll throw outside!
737,Throw it outside.
738,You'll throw outside!
739,Now you think you can do that?
740,"Yes, sir."
741,"Well, show me."
742,Hey.
743,"l thought maybe ifyou came home, itwould help out a little bit."
744,She's sick.
745,She's not doing so good.
746,lt'sjust kind of hard.
747,Football's starting and this is a lot.
748,"l thought if maybe you could come home, it'd help out a little because she's your mother, too."
749,Okay.
750,"Can you get thejob done, Mike?"
751,We're pretty small.
752,l didn't ask you if you think we're small.
753,l asked you ifyou think we can get thejob done.
754,l think so.
755,"You're gonna have to do betterthan ""l think so."" ls that clear?"
756,lt's clear.
757,Now l'm gonna assume that by now you've learned that the world's not fair and sometimes you get the short end.
758,That's all you get.
759,And ifyou don't do something personally to fix it then that's all you're ever gonna get.
760,"Yes, sir."
761,Mike.
762,Do you want to play college ball?
763,Do you want to get out ofthis town?
764,l think so.
765,Why aren'tyou doing something about it?
766,My ma's not right.
767,"One ofthese days, you're gonna have to get out ofthis house."
768,You're gonna have to leave her.
769,"Yes, sir."
770,You got to accept the fact that people have to take care ofthemselves and that includes you.
771,You understand that?
772,"Yes, sir."
773,Okay.
774,The truth is against some pretty overwhelming odds ifyou do decide to accept that...
775,"Look at me, Mike."
776,"lfyou decide to accept that you're gonna seriously fly, son."
777,"SPORTSCASTER 1: Same song, different verse."
778,"Middle of the second quarter, Cooper has a 140 lead."
779,Things are really going south in a hurry.
780,"Butwhen you got an offense play built around one player, that's great as long as the player's there."
781,"When he gets hurt, in this case like Boobie did, what do you do?"
782,"SPORTSCASTER 2: l don't know, but Gaines better come up with a plan quick 'cause the unthinkable will happen."
783,The Panthers are gonna lose two consecutive district games.
784,Wilson gets the handoff and he's got room to run on the lefthand side.
785,Across the line.
786,Clotheslined by Gary Grubb.
787,And he's down.
788,Give me a running back!
789,We got a running back?
790,"SPORTSCASTER 1: Permian has lost Boobie Miles, now Wilson..."
791,"Comer! Yeah, come on!"
792,...leaving him with thirdstring running back Chris Comer.
793,"Comer around the right side has some room to run, and runs out of bounds."
794,What is that?
795,l didn't have a block.
796,You are so soft!
797,Are you scared?
798,l didn't have no block.
799,Football is a contact sport!
800,l think he's a sophomore.
801,SPORTSCASTER 2: ...looking for a badminton scholarship but that's not gonna cut it.
802,Blue 40!
803,SPORTSCASTER 1: The snap. Looking to throw. Here comes the rush.
804,"Winchell avoids the rush, throws the ball."
805,"Comerturns from blockerto receiver has the ball, crosses the 20yard line crosses the 30."
806,Comerto the 40!
807,Comerto the 50!
808,Where did this speed come from?
809,Go!
810,Who was that?
811,ltwas Comer.
812,Our Comer?
813,ltwas Comer.
814,SPORTSCASTER 1: Comer has a Mojo touchdown!
815,Chris Comerwith his first varsity TD.
816,Not letting go ofthat ball.
817,Give me the ball.
818,power play in Permian history.
819,"lnterception, Brian Chavez!"
820,Abilene Cooper back to punt. lt's blocked!
821,"Touchdown, Permian!"
822,That's a Mojo touchdown.
823,Jesus!
824,"Billingsley up the middle, picks up a great block from Comer."
825,"Forearm shiver, in forthe Mojo touchdown."
826,SPORTSCASTER 2: There's your old school football.
827,Where did this guy come from?
828,SPORTSCASTER 1: Chris Comer has poured on some fantastic runs and one fantastic pass reception leading Mojo from a 14nothing...
829,Hello?
830,l'm feeling great.
831,How are you?
832,l feel much better than l did before the hit.
833,SPORTSCASTER 3: This team has a swagger.
834,They're walking tall and playing tough.
835,SPORTSCASTER 4: l love these kids.
836,l love the way Winchell is playing.
837,They came together after Boobie went out...
838,He's got him.
839,Touchdown in the corner!
840,"You know, wejust have to dig deep..."
841,MAN 1: Comer's amazing.
842,He's stepping in just nicely.
843,MAN 2: My concern is that he doesn't have the experience in the long run.
844,"MAN 3: lfthey can just stay strong, not get overconfident and take out Midland Lee, l think we're going, man."
845,"WOMAN 1: l think we're gonna go all the way, but l'm a little worried."
846,"Oh, no, sir."
847,lt'sjust a small sprain.
848,ltwasjust a precaution.
849,MAN 4: We're on a roll.
850,MAN 5: Don't get started on the celebration dance justyet.
851,We got Midland coming up.
852,SPORTSCASTER 5: Midland Lee is the real deal.
853,WOMAN 2: You don't need to be swaggering now.
854,You got to be playing and practicing.
855,"SPORTSCASTER 6: Permian zips past North Shore Galena, 173."
856,"Come on, we're five and one."
857,The team is winning now.
858,"MAN 1: They're winning, butwho we playing?"
859,"l mean, come on, mediocre teams."
860,SPORTSCASTER 6: Two losses could shut the door on the Permian Panthers.
861,"MAN 1: Let's not start tooting our hornsjust yet, you knowwhat l mean?"
862,"MAN 2: You lose two division games in this football climate and you're done, Sammy."
863,BOOBlE: Midland.
864,L.V.: Boobie.
865,This the best damn hospital in Texas.
866,The very best.
867,"DOCTOR: My son, Andrew, played for Midland, and ended up back East at Penn."
868,He's playing with Joe Paterno?
869,University of Pennsylvania.
870,Premed.
871,Just let it relax.
872,You have any pain?
873,BOOBlE: Not at all.
874,Does this hurt?
875,No.
876,None ofthat hurts?
877,Nope.
878,"Okay. Go ahead and sit up, and just letyour legs hang over."
879,Go ahead and get dressed and let me look at the scan.
880,l'm sorry.
881,You're James' dad?
882,"No, l'm his uncle."
883,"DOCTOR: Come over, and let me look at the scan with you."
884,This is the scan wejust did today of his knee.
885,This is looking right through the middle ofthe knee.
886,"Whatwe're looking at right through here is the ACL and what this shows is that he's had a fairly significant, fairly serious injury."
887,Let me show you.
888,Right through here is where the injury is and it looks like you've had a pretty serious injury to that part ofyour knee significant enough that l have concerns aboutwhatyou can do from here on.
889,So when can l suit up?
890,"Let mejust say, with how your knee feltwhen l examined it and what l see on the scan with the things thatyou do well the reason thatyou're great is you can run and cut and hammer people and you don't hesitate because you've got a solid knee."
891,"When you don't have this ligament you can't do that, so it's out of the question."
892,No.
893,That's notwhat Dr. Spencer said.
894,He said three weeks.
895,"Three weeks is up, and l'm ready to play."
896,l understand.
897,"But again, when l..."
898,"Based on what l see when l feel and examine your knee, what l see here you really can't playwith this kind of..."
899,"What are you talking about, ""l can't play""?"
900,l'm gonna play.
901,l'm ready to play.
902,My team needs me.
903,l'm ready to play.
904,Listen to me.
905,l am listening to you.
906,l wantwhat's best foryou.
907,You and l are on the same page...
908,We ain't on the same page.
909,How you gonna want what's best for me?
910,Hold on.
911,How you gonna want what's best for me?
912,"You from Midland, right?"
913,"This is bull, man."
914,You justjealous 'cause you from Midland.
915,What l recommend...
916,Who paying you?
917,"Come on, Boobie. That's okay."
918,You trying to take my football career!
919,"L.V.: Boobie, let's get out of here."
920,"Whatever you're saying to me, listen to me."
921,Who's paying you?
922,"SAMMY: Here back on Mojo Radio, it's Slamming Sammy Stands."
923,"l knew tonight's game was gonna be a big game, but itjust got bigger."
924,"Earliertoday, Cooper beat Woodland."
925,"lf Permian wins tonight, they're in the playoffs."
926,"lfthey lose, though, they fall back into a threeway tie forfirst place and that means the tiebreaker is a coin toss."
927,GAlNES: So what did the doctor say?
928,lfyou go out there before your knee's ready...
929,"Coach, my knee's fine."
930,"You okaywith this, L.V.?"
931,"Yeah, l'm good with it."
932,Go get dressed.
933,SPORTSCASTER 1: The most storied rivalry in the state ofTexas is Permian hosting the Midland Lee Rebels at Ratliff Stadium.
934,Tonight one ofthese teams could take a step toward the playoffs.
935,"Permian has one district loss, both Cooper and Midland have two."
936,SPORTSCASTER 2: There's no doubt about that.
937,Awin tonight puts Permian in the playoffs no coin flip needed plus itwill send the Lee Rebels home forthe season.
938,"Well, what do you know, folks."
939,Look at this.
940,Coming out of the locker room number 45 has emerged from the locker room.
941,Boobie doesn't look like he's limping at all.
942,He looks good to me.
943,He looks like he's ready to go.
944,"Now the question is, decoy or player?"
945,He ain't gonna play.
946,l don't think so either.
947,SPORTSCASTER 1: From what l know about Coach Gary Gaines nobody holds his cards closerthan Gary.
948,"Come on, guys. Let's go."
949,SPORTSCASTER 1: Winchell pitches to Comer.
950,Flipped on his head!
951,"Winchell, pressured by Olivera swings a pass out to Billingsley."
952,Picked off by Dominguez.
953,Dominguezwill take it in from 25 yards away.
954,And Lee breaks on top.
955,"Hang on to the ball, son!"
956,Don'tworry about it.
957,Shake it off.
958,"Don'tworry about it, Coach."
959,Let me spin.
960,"Y'all want to win, put Boobie in."
961,Set. Hut!
962,SPORTSCASTER 1: Winchell will swing it out to Billingsley.
963,"Come on, Donny."
964,And the ball is stripped by Dominguez.
965,"Kevin Lane, and a blatant facemask by Billingsley."
966,Dang!
967,What's up?
968,"My goodness. Son, is there something wrong with you?"
969,Are you mentally okay?
970,What are you putting your helmet on for?
971,"Take your helmet off, son."
972,You're on the bench for a while.
973,You don't need that helmet.
974,SPORTSCASTER 1: Third down with less than two minutes to play in the half.
975,"Strandler overthe left side, uncontested. 32 yards down to TD."
976,SPORTSCASTER 2: Permian came in with a fourgame win streak but they haven't been tested all year.
977,Coach Gaines has to find a way to get his offense on track or start feeling his season slipping through his fingers.
978,Do you think you're playing football?
979,You are showing me nothing!
980,Do you understand me?
981,Do you think you got it made?
982,Because if that's whatyou think you're gonna find out what it feels like to sit on your asses and watch Midland Lee take your season!
983,"SPORTSCASTER 1: No offense tonight for Mojo, and still no sign of Boobie Miles."
984,Y'all want to win?
985,Put Boobie in. l'm about to spin.
986,"Come on, Coach."
987,Let me get this foryou.
988,"SPORTSCASTER 1: Under five minutes to play, and Lee still leads 147."
989,"Weak defense, weak offense and no Boobie."
990,"lfyou're Coach Gaines, what do you do?"
991,"SPORTSCASTER 2: Right now, Mike Winchell can't get this offense going and the Midland coach has seen Boobie on the sidelines."
992,"lfyou don't put him in, he knows you're bluffing."
993,l'd put him in.
994,"All right, move out!"
995,Come on!
996,"Boobie, you're in. Let's go."
997,Whatyou want?
998,"SPORTSCASTER 1: Well, we apparently are all gonna getwhatwe wished for because here comes Boobie Miles and this is certainly what the fans came to see."

1053,Midland Lee wins the ball game.
1054,lt's all right.

1059,"HOST: Another loss, and that's thrown us into a threeway tie."
1060,They're going to have a coin toss.
1061,MAN 1: You're serious?
1062,We're gonna get the three coaches together.
1063,They're gonna aII toss a coin.
1064,That's 5A's footbaII tiebreaker right now. What can I say?
1065,What the heII kind ofway is that to make a decision?
1066,When you assembIe the kind oftaIent that we have here and then you just throw it away Iike that.
1067,It started with him pIaying Boobie when we had a big Iead.
1068,This is a once in a Iifetime thing to be abIe to see these peopIe.
1069,"I mean, we couId have been in the history books."

1078,"You know what eIse it is, too?"
1079,They been doing too much Iearning in the schooIs.
1080,"My daddy used to take a bullwhip, and he'd cut it up and he'd tie Then he'd beat me in my gut till l got a sick feeling in my stomach."
1081,Well.
1082,That's how l feel when l watch you play football.

1089,You were sent down here to learn how to play football and you haven't.
1090,You have not.
1091,And l got to take that as a personal failure.
1092,HCST: Nobody in Mojo footbaII wants to win in a coin toss.
1093,But that's the way it is.
1094,That's the way the tiebreaker is.
1095,"MAN 1: WeII, they ought to change that."
1096,They ought to change coaches.
1097,Make a Iot of changes next year.

1112,MlKE: You can'twin.
1113,l feel like that all the time.
1114,Even when things are going good.
1115,"When we're winning, it's there."
1116,"And when we're losing, it's there."
1117,What is wrong with you?
1118,lt took me a long time to realize that there ain't much difference between winning and losing except for how the outside world treats you.
1119,"But inside you, it's about all the same. lt really is."
1120,"Fact ofthe matter is, l believe that our only curses are the ones that are selfimposed."
1121,You knowwhat l'm saying?
1122,"We, all of us, dig our own holes."
1123,"God, Dad."
1124,What is wrong with you?
1125,What's wrong with you?
1126,"Ladies and gentIemen, this is truIy unbeIievabIe."

1129,"Okay, Skip."
1130,"We're on in three, two, one."
1131,"Folks, we're here with the three winning coaches."
1132,We've aII agreed on the ruIes.
1133,"Two out ofthree here, odd man out."
1134,"If you got one taiIs, they're out."
1135,"If you got one heads, they're out."
1136,lt's a tough way after a great season forthe coaches but this is the way it's gonna be.
1137,"So when l give the word, we're gonna toss our coins and then the district's gonna have its two representatives."
1138,"Now let's see the coins, guys."

1141,'22 silver dollar. All right.
1142,"And Coach Gary Gaines from Permian, you got a '69 nickeI."

1159,Just leave it alone.
1160,That's heads.
1161,"SKlP: Yup, that's heads, too."
1162,Permian is aIso heads. Man!
1163,"SKlP: Well, that figures."
1164,The way your teams played each other it'd take more than one toss.
1165,Hang on a second.
1166,"You know, this coin's prettyworn."
1167,Does this look like heads to you?
1168,l can't tell the difference.
1169,lt might be tails.
1170,There might be some controversy here regarding Cooper's coin.
1171,lt's tails.
1172,So the good news is that life continues for both Midland Lee and Permian high schools.
1173,At least for another couple ofweeks.
1174,That's the good news.
