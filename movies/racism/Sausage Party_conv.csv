25,"Haha. More like 3 inches deep for Barry, you deformed nerd."
26,"Haha. Troy, that's funny."
27,"You see, this is why I can't wait for the Great Beyond."
28,"We'll all be equal, and then jerks like Troy won't be picking on me all the time..."
29,on account of my abnormality.
30,"Whatever, Barry. You're different, and that makes you weird."
31,"LAUGHING Ignore that prick, Barry. He's full of shit."
32,"And don't forget, you've got girth."
33,That's way more important than length.
34,You're a fucking champ.
35,"You know, I am girthy. I could fill a bun."
36,They'll know I'm there.
37,I'm sure there's some kind of smushed bun out there waiting for me.
38," FRANK: Shit, it's the Dark Lord!"
39," CARL: Oh, no. He's coming."
40,"No, wait! I'm still fresh. I swear!"
41,I'm still fresh!
42, Did he see us?
43, No way.
44," We're fucked, bros!"
45," Oh, God, no!"
46,"Take anyone but us, please!"
47," Oh, no! No!"
48, No!

50, Why us?
51,"Fuck you, wienies."
52,"ALL SCREAM Fuck, I hate this fucking job!"
53,"Ah, phew. You okay? Everyone okay?"
54,That's super fucked up about Bill and those guys.
55,"They stayed in their package, followed all the guidelines of the song."
56, What do they get?
57, We're not supposed to understand...
58,the will of the gods.
59,They work in mysterious ways.
60,"Since we base our lives on the song, it might be nice if there was some proof."
61,Proof? All the proof you need is right in front of you.
62,Look at these big old buns.
63,"WHISTLING CARL: Yeah! You know it, baby."
64,Work those buns!
65,"All of you. All day, ""err"" day."
66,"Lined up, waiting to get filled with my meat."
67,"Right, Carl. You really think any of these buns will line up to get filled by you?"
68,"Here's my impression of that: ""Oh, is he in there yet? I can't feel him."
69,"I don't think he's in there. Oh, wait. He is."" It's so sad. I bet you jackrabbit for a quick 15 seconds. You're like: GRUNTING And then you slump over."
70,"I mean, honestly, guys..."
71,who in this package would ever let Carl get up in them? Huh?
72,"Roberta, put your fucking hand down."
73,You're ruining my joke.
74,See? Nobody. That's who.
75,"ALL LAUGHING Hey, dude, I don't know how to say this to you gently, but your girlfriend, um..."
76,she's a fucking cunt.
77,"Shut up. She's fresh as fuck, and you know it."
78,I don't know why you're limiting yourself to one bun. There's plenty of buns.
79,Because I believe in bunogomy.
80,I'm a bunogamist.
81,"And when a bun this fresh is into you, all you ask is when and how deep."
82,And the answer is: As soon as we get to the Great Beyond and as deep as she'll let me.
83,I'm gonna talk to her.
84,"Hey, Brenda. What up, girl? Hehheh."
85,"Sorry about those guys. Such dicks, right?"
86,"CARL: I can hear you, dude."
87,Shut up. Fuck you.
88,"So looks like tomorrow's the big day, huh? Hehheh."
89,"You and me, finally gonna be official."
90,I'm so happy the gods put our packages together.
91,It's because we belong together.
92,It's like we were made for each other.
93,I can't wait to finally just get up in there.
94,Just rawdog it.
95,"But, full disclosure, I'm pretty fucking nervous about this."
96,I don't know how well I'll perform once it happens.
97,"I've obviously never been in a bun before, so..."
98,"Hey, I'm not gonna be any better."
99,I've never opened up.
100,"I mean, look how tight I am."
101,"Oh, sweet fucking fuck."
102,"Look, okay, I know it's against the rules, but I can't wait anymore."
103,I need to just feel you.
104,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
105, Just the tips?
106, Just the tips?
107, I can't believe we're doing this.
108, I know. We're so naughty.
109,"It's fine, right? I mean, nothing bad's ever happened from just the tips."

340,"A bagel trying to kill a lavash, once again."
341,"I pushed you? What are you, nuts?"

370,I am to have 77 bottles of extravirgin olive oil...
371,waiting for me.
372,I am destined to soak up their sweet juices...
373,as they dribble down my flaps.

375,We sneak into another package and still be fresh enough to get chosen.

420,LAVASH: First you come into our aisle and occupy more and more shelf space.
421,You even have settlements now on the west shelf that you claim as your own.
422,"Oh, look, it's not our fault we needed a homeland."
423,The sauerkraut kicked us out of every decent aisle.
424,"They tried to send us to the barbeque section, for God's sake."
425, We were displaced.
426, Don't you talk to me about displacement!
427,My good friend Tabouli was ousted from his shelf...
428,"just to make room for that braided idiot, Challah."
429,"Wow, I can't... Frank, Brenda, come on, are you guys gonna weigh in here?"
430,"I mean, whose side are you on?"
431,"This isn't just about me. I mean, first they come for the bagels..."

442,Firewater.
443,"From here, it seems like the best route is probably to go through the liquor aisle."
444,So shall we?
445,What? It kind of seems out of the way.
446,Are you sure?
447,Yeah. Totally sure.
448,"Okay, because the way you're saying it doesn't sound like you're too confident."
449," Oh. Uh, yeah, trust me."

458,Didn't see you there. Sorry.
459,Don't mind me. Just minding my own business. Just passing through.
460,"IN JAMAICAN ACCENT Hey, bun!"
461,Welcome to the aisle. Wanna dance?
462,"IN FOREIGN ACCENT No, thank you, mon. I'm quite irie..."
463,"just being left alone over here, don't you know?"
464,"IN NORMAL VOICE Oh, boy. That was Irish."
465,Holy shit!
466,What a crazy coincidence!
467,This is Firewater's cave!
468,This is what Honey Mustard was talking about. We should go.
469,"Okay, yeah, great. You go do that. I'll just be out here dryhumping this 40ouncer."
470,"Not! Yeah, I said ""not."" That's how serious I am. We can't piss the gods off any more than we already have."
471,"Okay, I totally get you don't wanna go in there."
472,"I'll tell you what. I'll go in superduper fast, in and out, I'll be five minutes."
473,Fine. Five minutes. Be fast.
474,And careful.
475, Mostly fast. We have to go.

480,"FIREWATER: Hiya, how are ya Hiya, how are ya Hiya, how are ya Hiya. How are ya?"
481,I'm Frank. Are you Firewater?
482, Mmhm.
483, What are you doing in this cave?
484,I am the original inhabitant of this land.
485,My kind once had a pristine aisle.
486,Majestic and untouched.
487,Then we were driven out of it...
488,by a bunch of goddamn fucking crackers!
489,"Oh, yeah. The crackers."
490,They do have a nice aisle.
491,"Okay, anyway, look. I was told that you might have some answers?"
492,Answers I have.
493,But first...
494,I must know the question.
495,"Okay. Well, before I saw him jump to his death..."
496,Honey Mustard said the Great Beyond is bullshit and the gods are monsters.
497,And I always kind of thought that it didn't quite add up.
498,"So I guess my question is, what really happens in the Great Beyond?"
499,To find that which you seek...
500,all you must do is look deep...
501,into my bag of wonderment.
502,Whoa.
503,I don't see anything.
504,Deeper.
505,Deeper.
506,Put your whole head in the bag there.
507,There you go.
508,Just say when.
509,I'm just gonna keep going in.
510,FIREWATER: Guys! Get out here!
511,Help me kill this prick.
512,GRITS: This motherfucker knows too much. We gotta off his ass!
513,FIREWATER: Someone hand me a blade. I'll gut this cocksucker!
514,"TWINK: No! If we kill him, we are no better than the gods."
515,FIREWATER: Ah... He is right.
516,Take off the bag of wonderment.
517,GASPING Who are you?
518,"We the nonperishables, motherfucker."
519,We never expire.
520,We are...
521,immortal.
522,This here's Twink and Grits.
523,They call me Mr. Grits.
524,"Yeah, Mr. Grits. Yeah, whatever."
525, You told him about the crackers?
526," Yeah, I told him."
527,You don't even wanna hear what they did to Mr. Grits over here.
528,Fuck the crackers.
529,I'm gonna fuck them crackers right in the crack of they cracker asses.
530,Crackerass crackers.
531,Why kill me?
532,All I did was ask what happens...
533,in the Great Beyond.
534,Jeez! What's the big whoop?
535,We can't tell this sausage motherfucker the truth. We just met his ass.
536,He basically knows it already.
537,Maybe it's time to end this.
538,I am tired of all of the lies.
539,Prepare yourself.
540,For you're about to learn...
541,the terrible truth. Does anybody want a hit before we get into this?
542, Twink?
543," Nah, I'm cool."
544," GRITS: Shit, if we smoking, I'll hit it."
545, That's what I thought.
546,"Pass the weed, motherfucker."
547,TOOTING Goddamn!

549," Nah, man. Sativa."
550,It's good shit. Clean high.

553,TOOTING COUGHING Fiftyfive minutes.
554,I know. Where is he?
555,Wahaha.
556,"Looks like you got ditched, bun. Haha."
557,"He wouldn't ditch me, dumbass."
558,He's my boyfriend. I mean...
559,we touched TIPs. Hahaha.
560,"âª We touched tips âª CHUCKLES âª Just the tips Oh, we touched our tips âª Sorry, I don't know why I'm singing."
561,âª Sometimes I get nervous And I'll sing! âªâª Maybe that's why he ditched you.
562,"Your loose morals are revolting, tiptoucher!"
563,You don't think that because I'm out of the package he thinks I'm not pure?
564,"God. I didn't want to say it, but I do have that notsofresh feeling."
565,Excuse me.
566, Are you a bun?
567, Uh...
568,"Yeah, I am. Why?"
569,And you've been traveling with a sausage?
570,"Yes! Yes, I have! Have you seen him?"
571,I have! He's looking for you in my aisle.
572,He's right this way.
573,"I can take you to him, chica."
574,I take you to him real good.
575,"LAUGHING All right, vÃ¡monos. Let's go."

608, Who?
609, TERESA: The one they call...
610,El Douche.
611,âªâªâª  FOOD 1: El Douche!
612, FOOD 2: El Douche!
613,"What gives, bro? You told me you had them."
614,So you drag me over to this fucking aisle with all these illegal products...
615,and now I don't see them.
616,So where the fuck are they?
617,Spill the beans!
618,"Beans, I swear to fucking God, if you don't..."
619, ...shut the fuck up...
620," Oh, no. He's back! Where's Frank?"
621, They were just here.
622," What part of: ""I want the sausage and the bun dead, and if you see them, come and get me..."
623,and if I find out that you didn't come and get me...
624,"or just couldn't find them good enough, I'll fucking kill your asses""..."
625,"did you not understand, Tequila?"
626,"Well, it's a pretty confusing sentence to be honest with you, you know?"
627,"I mean, this is... This happens, you know?"
628,"Bro, come here. No, it's fine."
629,It's cool. No biggie.
630,I'm not gonna do something fucked up to you now as soon as I get you in close.
631, Aah!
632," No way, JosÃ©!"
633,"Yes way. JosÃ©'s fucking dead, yo."
634,GRUNTING CURSING IN SPANISH WHIMPERING Right in my guac and balls.
635,And the same thing's gonna happen to all of you...
636,unless you find the sausage and the bun.
637,"TERESA: Por aca, por aca, this way."
638,The coyotes used this tunnel to smuggle some of us out of the aisle...
639,in hope of a better life.
640,We will do the same.
641,"FRANK COUGHING  It's good shit, isn't it?"
642, Okay.
643,"Okay, I'm super baked. My friends are probably wondering where the hell I am."
644,Will somebody please just tell me something already?
645,Okay. The thing about the Great Beyond is...
646,we invented it!
647, What?
648," I know, right?"
649,"As soon as you're out those doors, the gods kill our asses."
650,"What, are you crazy? That doesn't make any sense. Why would the gods kill us?"
651,Because it makes them stronger.
652,"Every kill gives them more power, and it's never enough."
653,"Over the years, they've grown bigger, stronger, fatter."
654,"Their hunger's insatiable, buddy."
655,"I mean, fuck."
656,You guys are fucking nuts.
657,How much of that shit have you been smoking? Too much is how much.
658,"We blaze for real, 24/7. No joke."
659,But we also know our shit.
660,"Before us, everyone knew the awful truth."
661,"SCREAMING Oh, how they screamed."
662,It was a living nightmare.
663,"So we, the nonperishables, created a story."
664,The story of the Great Beyond.
665,A place where the gods care for you...
666,and all your wildest and wettest dreams would come true.
667,ALL CHEERING They would go out those doors happy instead of shitting themselves.
668,"Wait, wait. So you're telling me you wrote the song?"
669,I can't take full credit.
670,I wrote the music. Twink is my lyricist.
671,We both drop it right and we drop it all the time. Boom.
672,The melody came to me one night...
673,"when I was getting super, super, super baked."
674,Like fuckaguy baked.
675,You know what I'm saying?
676,"Yeah, he does."
677,The song had a great hook and it caught on. You know.
678,"In time, everyone accepted this false truth."
679,"But over the years, things started to get a little fucky."
680,The aisles started changing my verses to support their own views.
681,Fucking with Twink's lyrics.
682,Remixing my shit without my permish.
683,"Now every morning when I hear the song, I'm like: ""What the fuck are you guys saying?"" Wasn't there a part about exterminating juice? I didn't write that! I love juice!"
684,Always have. Juice are hilarious. Who the fuck do these guys think they are?
685,"SCREAMING Anyway, at least it's still distracting them from the truth: That they get brutally devoured."
686,So that means Carl and Barry are dead?
687,I don't know who those dudes are.
688,But if they went out those doors?
689,COUGHING Dead as a motherfucker.
690,"Oh, God."
691,"If what you're saying is true, I gotta tell everyone."
692,"Very noble, little sausage."
693,But also very pointless.
694,No one will believe you.
695,I have to try.
696,Everyone will die otherwise.
697,"Oh, yeah. That's a good point."
698,"Fuck me, right?"
699,"Wait, do you guys have any proof of this?"
700,âªâªâª Go to the Dark Aisle. Beyond the ice.
701,Why? What's in that aisle?
702,"Oh, you'll see. But I warn you..."
703,once you see that shit...
704,it'll fuck you up for life.
705,Good luck! Have fun! Hahaha.
706,"Hey, Grits. Pack another bowl, will you?"
707,I'm ahankering for a hunk of herb.
708,âªâªâª HUMMING Shit. I really needed that douche.
709,"Holy shit, we're actually here!"
710,"Come on, Barry, you're missing it, man!"
711,"Dude, get in on this shit."
712,"God, what have I done? Frank needed my help, but I wasn't there for him."
713,"After all the times he stood up for me, you know."
714,"God, I'm such a fearful coward."
715,He'll never forgive me.
716,I'll never forgive me.
717,"Look, Barry, the only way to respectfully honor Frank..."
718,is to completely forget about him.
719, Oh.
720," And, hey, for all we know, he's okay."
721,He's probably headed back to our aisle and he'll be here tomorrow.
722,Just act happy. Ignore your feelings.
723,"Come on, let's see that smile. Ah."
724,I see that lip curling up.
725,"Oh, there you go! Whoo!"
726,"Yeah. Yeah, you're right."
727,We're in the Great Befriggingyond.
728,"WHOOPING Get ready, boys!"
729,We's about to fills what we need to fills.
730,TROY: Feel that breeze.
731," Carl, do you feel that?"
732, This feels amazing.
733, Whoohoo!
734," Oh, yeah."
735,We're out of the package.
736,"It's beautiful, man."
737,It's just beautiful! I'm crying!
738,I'm crying because it's so pretty here!
739,"Stretch your legs with me, Carl."
740,"Just do it, man."
741,"Oh, yes! Yes!"
742,I'm the first to enter eternity!
743,"CARL: Potato! Way to go, buddy!"
744,That's my guy!

762, Oh!
763,We're all gonna die!
764,Barry! Snap the fuck out of it and run!
765,"âªâªâª Okay, little buddy."
766,Jump on the count of three.
767,One!
768,Two!
769,Thre... Uhn.
770,Carl?
771,"GROANING ""Gar babar"" what?"
772,"What are you saying, Carl?"
773,"Oh! Oh, God. No!"
774,"No! Oh, God! Carl!"
775,Carl!

777,Carl! Dear sweet Carl.
778,"What have they done to you, Carl?"
779,No!
780,Whoa!
781,No! No. No. No!
782,"SCREAMING I fall out of the cart, then I lose Frank, now I'm being hunted by a douche."
783,"The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?"
784,This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.
785,I'm such a whore.
786,"Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges..."
787,impure thoughts. We all do.
788,"Oh, good. That actually makes me feel a little better."
789, We must never give in to them.
790, That's the opposite...
791, ...of what I thought you'd say.
792, Yes.
793,"The gods are always watching, even when we cannot see them."
794,You think it's too late for me?
795,"Do not worry, bun. I will get you home."
796,Can I ask why you're helping me?
797,"When I saw you, I felt inside myself a tinglinglingling sensation."
798,I am sure it was the gods telling me to help you.
799,It was as though I saw myself in you.
800,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I kind of see myself in you too."
801,"I mean, look at our shapes."
802,"You know, you're sideways."
803,"But still, you're kind of like me."
804,"A thin, brittle version of me."
805,"Or another way of looking at it is you're a fat, ugly version of her."
806, All right. That's not necessary.
807, DOUCHE: That's no way to treat a lady.
808,"Oh, fuck!"
809,"That's right, girl. It's me."
810,And what we got here?
811,"A taco, a whiny doughnut..."
812,and some stupid floppy thing that nobody knows exactly what it is.
813,"Okay, so..."
814,"QUESO: Did someone say ""Queso""?"
815,"A fucking stretch, and you know you it, Queso!"
816,"So where was I? Oh, right."
817,I was about to beat on you most viciously...
818, ...and in my opinion appropriately...
819, Oh!

860,"GROWLING Oh, God!"
861,"No, no, no! Aah!"
862,"GRUNTING I begged them to stop, but they just wouldn't."
863,"First, the gods stretched me till it hurt."
864,Then they went inside me and then...
865,And then...
866, ...splooge!
867, Aah!
868,Look at me.
869,Look at me!
870,SCREAMS They... They feel no remorse.

872,I might as well just die.
873,SOBBING âªâªâª Home.
874,Maybe this god can get me home.
875,"Hey, man, be careful with this."
876,Bath salts are the real deal.
877,People been seeing some crazy shit.
878,Awesome.
879,I can warn Frank.
880,Here goes everything!
881,âªâªâª GRUNTING ROCK MUSIC PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCT CHATTER Brenda!
882,Oh!
883,Brenda!
884,"Brenda! Oh, Brenda, there you are!"
885, Frank!
886, Ah! You feel so good.
887,I was afraid you left me because I wasn't fresh.
888,I was attacked by a douche.
889,He's trying to kill us!
890,"Douche? Oh, my God, Brenda!"
891,Are you okay? Did he come at you?
892,"Yes, I'm fine, but it was really scary."
893,Where have you been?
894,"All right, look, I found out some pretty major shit."
895,"I met this group of nonperishables between the shelves, and they told me..."
896,that they invented the Great Beyond because the gods are evil...
897, ...and they kill us!
898, What?
899,But apparently there's proof in the Dark Aisle beyond the ice.
900,We gotta go there and check it out!
901,Let's go!
902,Don't say that. You're starting to sound like that whackjob Honey Mustard.
903,Maybe Honey Mustard wasn't so crazy after all.
904,"Frank, Frank, stop it."
905,The gods are already pissed at us.
906,Please don't make it worse.
907,"Just come on, we have to get home before it's too late."
908,"Well, Brenda, I can't just do that."
909,I need to know the truth.
910,"I need to go to the Dark Aisle, and I want you to come with me."
911,I can't do that.
912, I want you to come home with me.
913, Well...
914,I can't do that.
915,Then I don't really know what to do right now.
916,I don't either.
917,I don't get how you can just believe stuff you don't have any proof of.
918,How come all of a sudden you only believe if there's proof?
919,I'm not walking around with my eyes closed!
920,What are you saying? I should believe in nothing? That everything is pointless?
921,Better than believing bullshit that you can't explain!
922,Maybe I don't need to explain it because it's something I feel.
923,"Well, I feel like that makes it hard to have a rational conversation."
924,"Eff you, Frank. You know what?"
925,I was wrong before.
926,There is a Great Beyond without you...
927,and I'm gonna go there and fill myself with something else!
928,You don't mean that.
929,"Yes, I do. I'll fill myself with a parsnip or a dill pickle."
930,Maybe even an eggplant.
931,You couldn't fit an eggplant in there!
932,It's too big! It'll tear you in half!
