1001,"Just once, I'm gonna find a planet of people that are worse than me at everything."
1002,A whole bunch of functional idiots.
1003,"I'm gonna go there, and I'm gonna be their Superman."
1004,Isn't that Canada?
1005,You shut your goddamn trash mouth!
1006,WEASEL: Meet... Domino.
1007,DEADPOOL: What's your shtick? I'm lucky.
1008,That's not a superpower.
1009,"Yeah, it is. No, it isn't."
1010,"Yes, it is. No, it isn't."
1011,"Yeah, it is. No, it isn't."
1012,"Yes, it is. No, it isn't."
1013,"Yeah, it is. Really isn't."
1014,"No, it isn't.Yes, it is."
1015,Told you.
1016,Get out of my head!
1017,I'm not in your head.
1018,"I'm in an Well, if you're so lucky, then what are you doing here with us?"
1019,I don't know yet.
1020,What's that supposed to mean?
1021,"There's a reason why I'm here, and I'll know when I know."
1022,Everything usually just kind of works out for me.
1023,Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.
1024,I don't know who that is.
1025,DEADPOOL: You're hired.
1026,Lucky me.
1027,DEADPOOL: I like her!
1028,"And last, but not least..."
1029,Peter.
1030,Am I getting catfished here or...?
1031,Any powers you wanna tell us about?
1032,PETER: No.
1033,I don't have one.
1034,"Um, I just saw the ad."
1035,No superpowers at all?
1036,"Uh, I have both Type 1 and 2 Diabetes."
1037,Ow! Oh!
1038,That's all the diabetes.
1039,Right?
1040,"Yeah, you got 'em all."
1041,"If you find a Type 3, let us know."
1042,Yeah.
1043,You're in.
1044,Yeah. Fuck!
1045,It's fulfilling work.
1046,GUARD: Let's go!
1047,GUARD: This is Convoy 17 departing the Ice Box.
1048,We are en route.
1049,CABLE: Peacetime makes people soft.
1050,I was born into war.
1051,Bred into it.
1052,Okay.
1053,What's the most pain you've ever felt?
1054,These restraints are pretty...
1055,People think they understand pain.
1056,They have no concept of it beyond their own worst experience.
1057,A bee sting.
1058,"Oh, yeah."
1059,Maybe the kind that leaves you more machine than man.
1060,"Yeah, getting old's not for sissies."
1061,That's what my Grandma Ginny used to...
1062,I've got a list.
1063,We're gonna work down it.
1064,Together.
1065,"Number one, I'm gonna bend something."
1066,Something that was not meant to bend.
1067,I'm gonna stop you right there because I'm not gonna make it to two.
1068,I won't even make it to one.
1069,"I don't do well with pain, you know."
1070,"If I stub my toe, I'm done for the day."
1071,I cried when they canceled Felicity.
1072,"When I get really scared, I get nervous erections."
1073,I have one right now.
1074,Don't look.
1075,It'll only make it worse.
1076,"I don't want you to hurt me, and I'll tell you anything you wanna know."
1077,Except for where they are.
1078,Russell's in a convoy heading southbound on Gerry Duggan Parkway.
1079,The monster's with them.
1080,I wouldn't fuck with him.
1081,DEADPOOL: You all know the plan.
1082,"Intercept the convoy, grab the boy."
1083,But not inappropriately!
1084,"WEASEL: You know what, I wouldn't fuck with Deadpool either."
1085,Because he's built a team.
1086,He's unstoppable.
1087,He has an ass pen.
1088,He'll stab you with it.
1089,"Watch out for this guy, Cable!"
1090,"He's very short, 5'11""."
1091,Not like in the comics.
1092,"And if we succeed, we all go home early."
1093,"WEASEL: So if you go after them, Cable, I warn you..."
1094,there's a wind advisory in effect.
1095,WIND HOWLING PILOT: ON PA A little turbulent up here.
1096,I don't know much about this Cable fella...
1097,but I guarantee he hasn't killed as many people as melanoma has.
1098,We're getting close!
1099,As a former XMan...
1100,"Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam."
1101,I was always appalled by the blatant sexism in the group's name.
1102,XMen! Men!
1103,"The point is, our group will be forward thinking."
1104,Gender neutral.
1105,"From now on, we'll be known as..."
1106,XForce.
1107,Isn't that a little derivative?
1108,"I don't recall asking your opinion, Peter!"
1109,That wasn't me.
1110,"Hang the laundry out at 1,300 feet..."
1111,"intercept the convoy, and grab the boy."
1112,"Let's bring on the carnage, baby!"
1113,"Get me on the ground, watch me go!"
1114,ALL: Yeah!
1115,ALL WHOOPING I can't wait to kill!
1116,Hey! Hey! Hey!
1117,I just wanna say how proud I am of this team.
1118,"You know, you guys look amazing!"
1119,"Vanisher, I have no doubt you look amazing too."
1120,This is the family that I've always dreamed of having and I...
1121,"Ah, shit."
1122,SNIFFLES I just get a little choked up sometimes.
1123,"I hate to interrupt, but is anybody nervous about the high winds?"
1124,Gary. My name's Peter.
1125,"I realize that you're new to this, but relax."
1126,You've been chosen by a higher power.
1127,Did he just call himself God?
1128,I think he did.
1129,I'd like to go home. And I'd like...
1130,"the McRib to be available year round, but sometimes dreams don't come true."
1131,I spent 10 years in Special Forces.
1132,You think we didn't jump out of the plane because of a light breeze?
1133,"You're in this shit now, Mustache!"
1134,WHISPERS I'm only yelling to impress the other guys.
1135,"I'd never let anything happen to you, Sugarbear."
1136,"Leonard, hit it!"

1155,You'd have to be insane to take off in this.
1156,"No, stage left, you idiot!"
1157,"GASPS Well, I guess we found something you're not better at."
1158,Vanisher.
1159,Maybe the wind can't blow what it can't see.
1160,GRUNTING Oh! Really?
1161,"All right, we could do this with four."
1162,Sugarbear.
1163,"You got this, buddy!"
1164,That's the stuff!
1165,That's the XForce spirit!
1166,Never underestimate a man with a mustache!
1167,Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.
1168,WHOOPS We did it!

1178,"Here we go, Peter!"
1179,Look at me.
1180,"We're XForce, right?"
1181,"Yeah, we're XForce. We're XForce."
1182,"Oh, my God!"
1183,What the fuck?
1184,"Fucking acidic vomit! SCREAMS WHIRRING Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up in my mask."
1185,"EXHALES DOMINO: Okay, I'm over the convoy."
1186,Where did the rest of the team land?
1187,Good news and bad news.
1188,Bad news is the whole team is dead.
1189,"The good news is, I don't think anyone's gonna miss Shatterstar."
1190,He was a bit of a prick.
1191,"Oh, but Paul!"
1192,DOMINO: Peter!
1193,"Peter, I'm gonna miss him most."
1194,But there is a slight chance Vanisher could make it.
1195,"PEOPLE EXCLAIMING Nope, no chance. He's dead."
1196,DOMINO: The whole team?
1197,Only the main ones.
1198,We're still good.
1199,"Fuck, you are dumb."
1200,Whoever planned this stunt's been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.
1201,I'll tell you that much.
1202,That's pretty obvious!
1203,"Looking good, Vanisher."
1204,They're headed into the tunnel.
1205,"I'm that kid's only hope, so sit tight and wait for my word."
1206,DOMINO: Whatever.
1207,We're gonna lose 'em.
1208,I'm dropping in.
1209,"DEADPOOL: Uh, that's a negative, sole survivor."
1210,Luck is not a superpower!
1211,We are so fucked!

1213,"CARS HORNS HONKING BRAKES SCREECHING DEADPOOL: Seriously, I don't get it!"
1214,"What, you shoot luck lasers out of your eyes?"
1215,It's just it's hard to picture.

1217,"I mean, luck?"
1218,"What coked out, glass pipesucking freakshow comic book artist..."
1219,came up with that little chestnut?
1220,Probably a guy who can't draw feet!

1222,It's why I'm cursed to be a solo act.
1223,Wander the Earth... I'm in.
1224,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
1225,I'm in.
1226,How in the fuck are you in already?
1227,"Oh, shit."
1228,It's Cable. 12 o'clock.
1229,DEADPOOL: Okay.
1230,New plan. Use all of your imaginary powers to stop Cable from killing that kid.
1231,I'm coming up on your six.

1238,He's tearing you open!
1239,He's going in through the back!
1240,"Oh, God, he's inside!"
1241,"You hear yourself, right?"
1242,DEADPOOL: Accidental double entendres!
1243,Russell! Russell Collins!

1307,"God, Russell."
1308,I have a mission.
1309,To get my revenge.
1310,I'm going to burn that headmaster alive.
1311,You're not the revenge type.
1312,Take it from a friend.

1324,Legs! Still hurts to hear out loud!
1325,What is that?

1333,DEADPOOL: XForce.
1334,BLIND AL: No child is hopeless.
1335,Don't give up on the boy.
1336,How could he just walk away?
1337,It was the coldness in his eyes.
1338,You should've heard it.
1339,WADE SIGHS I guess family really is an Fword.
1340,"GROANS Rub my legs, Mama."
1341,Why would I rub your legs?
1342,"Please, they hurt."

1344,BLIND AL SIGHS What in the...
1345,Why is your hand so tiny again?
1346,That's not my hand.
1347,"Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph!"
1348,That was nice for me. DOOR OPENS Wade! I heard what happened with the convoy and...
1349,GASPS WEASEL RETCHES Why wouldn't you cover that up?
1350,A warrior has nothing to be ashamed of.
1351,"WEASEL: Yeah, but you do."
1352,Look at you.
1353,"You're just straight shirtcocking it, toddlerstyle."
1354,"Oh, yeah."
1355,Full Winnie the Pooh.
1356,The hell's happening?
1357,Describe it.
1358,"I wouldn't ask him to do that, if I were you."
1359,"WEASEL: It's like, um... Here we go."
1360,"It's like he was giving birth anally, but they quit halfway through."
1361,"They got the legs out, and they said, ""You know what, I'm done."" Happy?"
1362,It's like he's a Muppet from the waist down.
1363,"But this time, you can see the Muppet's dick. DOOR OPENS Grover's got a cock the size of a twig."
1364,"DOPINDER: Mr. Weasel, I can no longer be doubleparked."

1370,Oh. Wow!
1371,Cool your pits.
1372,They're growing back.
1373,I'm talking about your face.
1374,I've never seen you without your mask before.
1375,Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.
1376,"DOMINO: Your legs, though, they're cute."
1377,You wanna borrow a pair of pants?
1378,I'm glad everybody dropped by.
1379,You must be wondering why I didn't call you here.
1380,I'll tell you why I'm here.
1381,"""The Time Traveler's Wife's"" husband..."
1382,beat me within an inch of my life.
1383,He was torturing me!
1384,But all I told him was everything he wanted to know.
1385,"So, I'm here to help us gear up."
1386,So we can go after him without me.
1387,WADE: No!
1388,I'm doing this alone.
1389,The Juggernaut will kill you all. Fair enough.
1390,WADE: I just need a couple of hours to get some legs under me. What will you do?
1391,WADE: I don't care what the kid did to me.
1392,"I ain't letting Cable get to him, even if I have to teabag him to death."
1393,It's really just a sip of tea at this point.
1394,"Zip it, black Black Widow!"
1395,I'm flowing.
1396,The first order of business is to get me in front of Cable...
1397,so I can pull all the fucking blood out of his body...
1398,and fashion his bones into holiday jewelry.
1399,"Then, I'm gonna take his skin..."
1400,and stretch it out over a homemade mating drum.
1401,"He's standing right behind you, isn't he?"
1402,COCKS GUN What in the ass?
1403,Is this apartment listed on Tinder? Grindr?
1404,"You picked the wrong shithole to fuck, future boy."
1405,Ugh. Is that really necessary?
1406,"No. It's his ""Basic Instinct."" What can we help you with?"
1407,I'm here to proposition you.
1408,"LAUGHS Oh, boy!"
1409,"He's really teeing it up, isn't he?"
1410,Who gets to make the first joke?
1411,I think we should all do it at the same time.
1412,Good call.
1413,"For $45, you get suckysuck."
1414,"BOTH: I only do over the pants, mouth stuff."
1415,Fuck!
1416,The Proposition has a wonderful Guy Pearce performance.
1417,"WADE: Wait, wait, wait!"
1418,I wanna do mine over.
1419,Give us the line again. I need your help!
1420,"Trust me, I'm even less happy about this than you are..."
1421,"but you unleashed the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!"
1422,I can't bring him down alone.
1423,So here we are.
1424,"We're no longer accepting applications for XForce, unfortunately."
1425,Even if we were...
1426,there's a wind advisory in effect until at least...
1427,We don't have a lot of time.
1428,Your friend's about to make his first kill.
1429,"No offense, but if you know so much..."
1430,"why not travel back to when he was a baby, kill him then?"
1431,"Or better yet, head back a little further, kill baby Hitler."
1432,I use a device to slide through time.
1433,"The longer I travel, the harder it is to control."
1434,"I got two charges: one to get me here, one to get me home."
1435,Well.
1436,That's just lazy writing.
1437,Your boy's gonna kill the headmaster of the orphanage tonight.
1438,"After that, he gets a real taste for it."
1439,"Like 10yearold Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!"
1440,So he keeps killing...
1441,"and killing, and killing, and killing. GUNS COCKING Until one day, he kills the wrong fucking people."
1442,My people.
1443,Relax.
1444,I'm retrieving something from my utility bag.
1445,It's a goddamn fanny pack...
1446,"and you know it, you sick son of a bitch!"
1447,The difference is night and day.
1448,You remind me of my wife.
1449,I'm sorry.
1450,"I said, ""You remind me of my wife."" No, I'm sorry that you said that..."
1451,while making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm.
1452,CABLE: She always struggled.
1453,But she was funny...
1454,and filtered her pain through the prism of humor.
1455,Something I could never master.
1456,It was my fault she died.
1457,It was my job to stop people like him.
1458,I came close a few times. TOMORROWPLAYING He wasn't too happy about that.
1459,He was trying to hurt me...
1460,and he knew exactly how to do it.
1461,OLDER RUSSELL: Blessed are the wicked who are healed by my hand.
1462,CABLE: He came into my home...
1463,and took the only thing that made it a home.
1464,Sound familiar?
1465,I'm sorry.Uhhuh.
1466,"No, I'm really sorry."
1467,But that isn't Russell.
1468,It doesn't have to be him.
1469,If you knew what I knew...
