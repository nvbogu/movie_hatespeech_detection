309, I'll be more stoked when I get down to the bottom in one piece.
310,It's definitely a different aspect of skiing.
311,It's always the nerves up here.
312,That's why I'm only doing one this year.
313,"Last year I definitely had, probably the best run on this face I think you could get really."

335, Announcer And this is a big one too.
336,Taking it deep into the tranny.
337, Announcer That was a huge run and we'd expect nothing less from the reigning champion here.
338," Got third in wildcard, so."
339,"crowd cheering So honestly what I try and do is just, go big."
340,"It's the funnest feeling, I think skiing."
341, Skier Well played.
342, Narrator The young Pehota has proven himself a competitive machine.
343,It just so happens he is also something of a beast on a machine.
344,upbeat music motor roaring Logan clearly has no qualms sending her to the moon.
345,But has he gotten her upside down?
346, No I haven't backied the sled yet.
347,"But it's been like my main goal, ever since I bought a sled which was like four years now."
348, I think this has kind of been nagging at him for a while and he wants to do it.
349,"Get it out of the way so he can actually get on, back with his skiing and concentrate on filming."
350," Logan Little intimidated, but jump looks money."
351,It's time to get 'er done.
352,"âª Have you done engine revving âª Have you done âª We get it, gonna come  I think so."

379,I'm stoked that we still get to spend so much time together.

391,But questions loom.
392,How would the rookie fare outside of ski area mini golf?
393,Would the whirling dervish be grounded by terrain of consequence?
394,Just how sendy would the big mountain slayer get?
395,"And could a man just shy of 40 hold his own, and survive amongst a pack of eager younglings?"
396, Send it!
397, Send it.
