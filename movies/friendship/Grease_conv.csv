764,Where are the maps?
765,What kind?
766,Street maps!
767,Yeah.
768,"Hey, miss, what do I owe you?"
769,Um... 50 cents.
770,How about that ride?
771,How about my windshield?
772,You forgot our green stamps.
773,What about the maps?
774,Get this windshield!
775,Come on!
776,Honk that horn!
777,Where are you going?
778,"Oh, I can't stop shivering."
779,Then hold on.
780,That's what's making me shiver.
781,We're home.
782,Shoot.
783,I'm the one that can't stop shivering now.
784,Why?
785,Because...
786,There's something I should tell you.
787,What?
788,"Oh, no."
789,We've got company.
790,Check this out!
791,I can handle these guys.
792,That's the dude!
793,When will I see you again?
794,Friday night.
795,Talent show.
796,Let's go!
797,"Have fun, you hear?"
798,Talent show?
799,How did he know?
800,Hi.
801,What are you guys doing?
802,What's the story with the creep?
803,What?
804,"The story, the creep."
805,"The creep, the story."
806,Why don't you leave her alone?
807,You shut up.
808,"You, let's have the story."
809,"Personally, I think..."
810,"We don't care, Sharon!"
811,No chick of mine messes with no creep.
812,No chick of yours?
813,Someone's jealous.
814,I ain't jealous!
815,"Stay out of my life, Johnny."
816,"I catch you with that punk one more time, I'll rearrange his face!"
817,He's a dead man!
818,Ded.
819,Who belongs to who around here?
820,You're making a scene.
821,I'm getting all mixed up.
822,You're embarrassing me.
823,You owe Paulette an apology.
824,Jerk!
825,Where are you going?
826,Forget about her.
827,Weirdos.
828,Who needs broads?
829,"Me. I get to second base, keep getting called out at third."
830,Poor guy bombed out.
831,Hey.
832,I think we could all use a little guaranteed...
833,Alltheway action.
834,And I know just the place.
835,Yeah?
836,Yeah?
837,"âª Well, come on âª âª and tell us, Johnny âª âª What's the secret âª âª of success? âª âª You gotta take a tip âª âª from the king of hip âª âª 'Cause you know âª âª that he's the best âª âª We're going prowling âª âª We're going prowling âª âª Tonight âª âª See you hungry for love âª âª Gotta find a chick âª âª who will give you more âª âª Well, there's a spot âª âª that I'll discover âª âª Where a guy's âª âª guaranteed to score âª âª I'm gonna show you cats âª âª some action âª âª Like you've never âª âª seen before âª âª We're gonna get âª âª some satisfaction âª âª Down at the grocery store âª âª We're going prowling âª âª We're going prowling âª âª We're going prowowowling âª âª Tonight âª âª There's a female butcher âª âª At the luncheon meat display âª âª Well, don't you know? âª âª Got the best tongue in town âª âª That's right âª âª She delivers all night âª âª and day âª âª You see the apple âª âª of your eye âª âª Stacking peaches âª âª in a fivefoot pile âª âª Just waitin' for some guy âª âª to come âª âª And take her rollin' âª âª down the aisle âª I like a debutante who comes across."
838,"Now, that's what I call class."
839,"Well, I like a tall girl with long legs that come right up to her..."
840,You know what I like?
841,"I like a girl who's really smart, provided that she's really stacked."
842,"Yeah? Well, I love 'em all, and they love me."
843,"âª 'Cause I'm the leader âª âª of this here pack, yeah âª âª We're gonna find ourselves âª âª some beauties âª âª Who are sad and all alone âª âª we're gonna find ourselves âª âª All alone âª âª We're gonna show them âª âª little beauties âª âª That we're TBirds âª âª to the bone âª âª We're going prowlin' âª âª walk, talk like a TBird âª âª We're going prowlin' âª âª walk, talk like a TBird âª âª We're going prowwowwolin' âª âª walk, talk like a TBird âª âª Tonight âª âª We're going prowlin' âª Let's go for the sales tax."
844,"Very nice, very nice."
845,We could win those albumens yet.
846,We can win those albumens.
847,We gotta get rid of the competition.
848,Competition.
849,There is some good work here.
850,There is also some sloppy work here.
851,"Miss Zinoni, I would like to see you about your Shakespeare essay."
852,"Attention, please."
853,A few reminders of graduation activities.
854,The final dress rehearsal for the talent show is Thursday afternoon.
855,Will all students on the decoration committee for the Lani Keilani Luau on Saturday report to coach Calhoun?
856,Who asked him to write that stuff?
857,She didn't like your paper.
858,I got to write it again.
859,Do you want help?
860,I don't know.
861,Think it over.
862,It's not a difficult decision.
863,"Steph, you coming?"
864,Yeah.
865,I'll think about it.
866,I usually don't do this bad in english.
867,I got other stuff on my mind.
868,Can I help you?
869,It's not with school. Forget it.
870,Let's get this over with.
871,Where do you want to start?
872,It's this guy.
873,What guy?
874,Forget it.
875,I'm trying.
876,I had this idea of Mr. Right.
877,"A stupid idea, right?"
878,Right.
879,"Then out of nowhere he shows up, like some dream."
880,Who?
881,Mr. Right.
882,"Oh, right."
883,I've seen him twice now.
884,I don't know who he is.
885,Mr. Right.
886,Right.
887,Don't you think that's weird?
888,"Not weird weird, but, like, exciting weird?"
889,"So, what's the problem?"
890,The problem is that maybe he's not everything I imagined.
891,What if he's just like some ordinary guy?
892,What if he is?
893,Hey?
894,We should get back to the Shakespeare essay.
895,I figured out what Hamlet's problem is.
896,No ketchup!
897,He seemed to get along pretty well without it.
898,How can you eat a hamburger with no ketchup?
899,I wouldn't know.
900,Where were we?
901,You figured out the problem with their hamburgers.
902,No ketchup.
903,His big problem is no laughs.
904,"The guy's got to lighten up, right?"
905,"No, thanks."
906,Who are we talking about now?
907,Hamlet.
908,"Oh, right."
909,"""Hamlet went totally nuts when he caught his mother doing it with his uncle."" Not so great, right?"
910,"You could have said something like, ""Hamlet was tormented ""by his mother's incestuous relationship with his uncle."" Incestuous rela..."
911,Mason's going to flip when she reads this.
912,"""Incestuous."" You're a really smart guy."
913,You must think I am some dummy.
914,"Actually, I think you're kind of terrific."
915,Get out of here.
916,You're the terrific one.
917,You know all this deep junk.
918,I just know a few big words that impress english teachers like our friend miss Mason.
919,"Well, you impressed me."
920,I give credit to who I want.
921,To whom.
922,"To you, that's whom."
923,"Learn how to take a compliment, all right?"
924,All right.
925,How about a hamburger for my friend...
926,Loaded?
927,With ketchup.
928,Double ketchup.
929,"There are cool, scorable broads in this joint."
930,Cool. Scorable.
931,Whatnot.
932,Very nice.
933,Very nice.
934,Lots of girls would date you.
935,What about you?
936,Are you kidding?
937,"No, I wasn't."
938,I didn't mean anything wrong.
939,"We're just different types, that's all."
940,Different types?
941,What do you mean?
942,There's a Pink Lady code.
943,"To quote Delores, ""the code stinks."" Hi."
944,It's nerd's night out?
945,"What are you, a cop?"
946,The TBirds ain't the class act no more?
947,We ain't the class act no more?
948,Wait for me inside.
949,I don't want to eat alone.
950,Go on!
951,"What do you want, Johnny?"
952,"Well, I just wanted to let you know that I'm officially declaring us as an item officially over."
953,You're declaring?
954,That's correct.
955,"O.K., fine. O.K.?"
956,You've declared it.
957,It's over.
958,Can I go now?
959,"Just like that, huh?"
960,I got one more thing to say to you.
961,That jacket you are wearing is TBird property.
962,I got a rep to protect.
963,"Don't damage the rep, and we don't damage new friends."
964,"So, what happened?"
965,"She, uh...?"
966,She take the nerd's brains over your brawns?
967,"Look, I dumped her, not versavice, got it?"
968,"Right, sure, Johnny."
969,Don't worry about it.
970,All right!
971,Cherry pie!
972,Davey!
973,"âª I'm all dressed up âª âª In my finest attitude âª âª Pretending âª âª I don't care âª âª Guess I really messed up âª âª By trying to be two âª âª When only one heart âª âª Can be there âª âª Why can't I be âª âª Just what I am âª âª And speak my love âª âª Without any shame? âª âª Why can't she see âª âª What I am âª âª Is a costumed fool âª âª Trapped in a tragic game? âª âª Charades and pretty lies âª âª They hide âª âª What's deep inside me âª âª Charades âª âª Conceal me âª âª But can't you feel âª âª The real me âª âª The real me âª âª Behind my charades? âª âª Oh, please don't mind me âª âª Performing at my hardest âª âª As I paint âª âª Upon the air âª âª You won't find me âª âª 'Cause it's a portrait âª âª of the artist âª âª As the man âª  Look!"

977,I'm so nervous!
978,You look perfect.
979,Have lots of fun tonight.
980,O.K. oh!
981,Thanks.
982,And good luck.
983,He said he'd meet her up front.
984,How can anyone like someone they don't even know?
985,She's got a crush.
986,I'll be back.
987,"Johnny, it's that guy!"
988,Get him!
989,No!
990,Johnny!
991,They'll kill him!
992,Who?
993,Move over!
994,Where are we going?
995,Go!
996,We're going to die! I'm wearing my mother's underwear!
997,Where are we going?
998,I don't know.
999,Follow them.
1000,I figured the guy to slow up.
1001,Right?
1002,It ain't our fault the guy don't slow up.
1003,"Huh, Johnny?"
1004,It's at least 100 feet across.
1005,Johnny?
1006,Yeah!
1007,Yeah.
1008,What can I say?
1009,"If he didn't make it, he ain't going to look pretty."
1010,Where is he?
1011,He ain't down there.
1012,Where'd he go?
1013,Biker heaven?
1014,I know he's dead.
1015,He made the jump.
1016,I could do that.
1017,"You could jump that, Johnny."
1018,Let's go.
1019,I'll never see him again.
1020,Come on!
1021,What have I done?
1022,He'll be O.K.
1023,Nobody rides like him.
1024,We got to get out of here.
1025,We'll be late.
1026,He jumped over a cop car!
1027,He'll show up.
1028,I know it!
1029,âª If your sweetheart âª âª Sends a letter âª âª Of goodbye... âª If I stand there...
1030,Don't worry.
1031,"Hi, Johnny."
1032,Hi.
1033,Hold it!
1034,"What are you, crazy?"
1035,"Come on, Paulette!"
1036,You're not going out there like that!
1037,I need a little something on my face.
1038,You need a little something on your body!
1039,"But Johnny, I'm Summer."
1040,"Get yourself a pair of galoshes, a snow suit, a scarf, and be Winter."
1041,And that is Johnny Nogerelli's final word.
1042,Yeah?
1043,Want to hear my final word?
1044,"Maybe you can bully some chicks, but this chick has been bullied by Johnny Nogerelli for the last time!"
1045,"I'm not the classiest, but I'm the best you'll get!"
1046,So take it or leave it!
1047,âª ...behind a cloudy sky âª âª So let âª âª your hair down âª âª And go on... âª Let go.
1048,Let go of me!
1049,Get!

1052,Stop that!
1053,Shut up!
1054,Quiet!
1055,"And now, Martin Meisner and his redhot accordion."
1056,Let's go practice in the can.
1057,"Don't worry, Johnny."
1058,"Hey, the albumens are ours."
1059,Hey. Hey!
1060,"Hey. Hey, come on, guys."
1061,Hey!
1062,Don't do this.
1063,"Okay, guys."
1064,"Thank you, Martin Meisner."
