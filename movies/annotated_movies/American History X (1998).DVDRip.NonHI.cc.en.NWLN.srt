FUCKING PERVERT, DAN.

00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,381
JESUS, DANNY,

7
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,348
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?

8
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,849
THERE'S A BLACK GUY OUTSIDE.

9
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,317
HE'S BREAKING INTO YOUR CAR.

10
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,686
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN THERE?

11
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,121
I DON'T KNOW.

12
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,439
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,874
NOT RIGHT NOW, HONEY. HOW MANY?

14
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,226
DANNY, HOW MANY?

15
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,494
ONE, I THINK.

16
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,563
IS HE STRAPPED? HUH?

17
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,008
DOES HE HAVE A FUCKING GUN?

18
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,599
MAN, I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

19
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,836
WAIT A SECOND. WHAT
THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

20
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,766
STAY RIGHT HERE
JESUS! AND BE QUIET.

21
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,908
WAIT A SECOND, DEREK. WAIT.

22
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:37,977
DEREK!

23
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,946
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

24
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,482
Stay right here.

25
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,782
AAH!

26
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,951
Murray: I DON'T HAVE A
PERSONAL PROBLEM WITH HIM, OK?

27
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,121
Sweeney: DON'T INSULT
MY INTELLIGENCE, MURRAY.

28
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,655
YOU HATE THIS CHILD,

29
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,673
AND I THINK I KNOW WHY.

30
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,154
Woman: DR. SWEENEY'S OFFICE.

31
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,416
I WENT OUT WITH HIS
MOTHER A FEW TIMES.

32
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,652
THAT WAS 3 YEARS
AGO. IT WAS NOTHING.

33
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,187
NOTHING. REALLY? HMM.

34
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,989
THAT PAPER... BOB,

35
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,441
IT'S A TRAVESTY,

36
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,577
ARGUING FOR HITLER
AS A CIVIL RIGHTS HERO.

37
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,090
YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE.

38
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,548
YOU KNOW, MURRAY, YOU
ACTUALLY DID THIS TO YOURSELF.

39
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,960
YOU TOLD THEM THAT
THEY COULD DO A REPORT

40
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,085
ON ANY BOOK THAT RELATED TO
THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS,

41
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,354
IN PLAIN ENGLISH.

42
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:06,174
I AM NOT DISPUTING THE FACT
THAT THE CHILD IS CONFUSED,

43
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:08,176
AND HE HARBORS SOME SICK IDEAS,

44
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,945
BUT I AM NOT READY
TO GIVE UP ON HIM YET.

45
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,732
HIS BROTHER PROBABLY
PUT HIM UP TO IT.

46
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,284
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU 100%

47
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,286
HIS BROTHER DID NOT
PUT HIM UP TO THIS.

48
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,432
I FIND THAT HARD TO
BELIEVE. WHATEVER.

49
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,184
LOOK, I KNOW HE WAS A GOOD KID,

50
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,786
AND IT'S A SHAME WHAT
HE'S BEEN THROUGH,

51
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,743
BUT THAT IS DANGEROUS.

52
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,727
DANGEROUS IN WHAT WAY?

53
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,562
THAT GOES TOO FAR.

54
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:32,433
THIS RACIST PROPAGANDA,
THIS<i> MEIN KAMPF</i> PSYCHOBABBL-

55
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:33,935
HE LEARNED THIS
NONSENSE, MURRAY,

56
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,770
AND HE CAN UNLEARN IT, TOO.

57
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,506
I WILL NOT GIVE UP
ON THIS CHILD YET.

58
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,509
I KNEW IT WAS YOU.

59
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,611
Sweeney: DANNY, GET IN HERE.

60
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,880
I SAID GET IN HERE!

61
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,081
GET IN HERE!

62
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,217
5, 4, 3, 2...

63
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,035
SHUT THE DOOR!

64
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,073
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, DANNY?

65
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,242
WHAT'S WHAT GONNA BE?

66
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,345
THIS PETTY CRAP YOU'RE PULLING.

67
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,081
I DON'T KNOW.

68
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,517
HAVE A SEAT.

69
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:26,788
AHEM.

70
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:29,874
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

71
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,778
FINE.

72
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,915
THINGS AT HOME OK?

73
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,583
YEAH.

74
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,522
DEREK GOT OUT THIS
MORNING, DID HE NOT?

75
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,626
YEAH, HE DID.

76
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,294
HE WAS ONE OF MY STUDENTS.

77
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,129
YOU KNEW THAT, RIGHT?

78
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,498
HONORS ENGLISH.

79
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,967
HE WAS A BRILLIANT STUDENT...

80
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,302
LIKE YOU...

81
00:08:57,354 --> 00:09:01,222
BUT HE HUNG OUT WITH
SIMPLE-MINDED FOOLS,

82
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,323
ALSO LIKE YOU.

83
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:03,392
LOOK, SWEENEY,

84
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,404
DID YOU BRING ME IN HERE
TO TALK ABOUT DEREK?

85
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,673
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO
HIM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

86
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,764
EVERYTHING YOU DO RIGHT NOW

87
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,733
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DEREK.

88
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,046
LOOK, I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS.
I WROTE AN "A" PAPER.

89
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,488
<i>MEIN KAMPF?</i>

90
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,591
I SHOULD EXPEL YOU.

91
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,659
GO AHEAD.

92
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,355
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I COULD HANDLE IT?

93
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,545
NO. I THINK THE
STREET WOULD KILL YOU.

94
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,647
YOUR RHETORIC AND
YOUR PROPAGANDA

95
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,683
AREN'T GOING TO
SAVE YOU OUT THERE.

96
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:32,620
SO HERE'S THE DRILL.

97
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,922
I'M YOUR HISTORY
TEACHER FROM NOW ON.

98
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,643
WE WILL DISCUSS CURRENT EVENTS.

99
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,595
WE WILL CALL THIS CLASS...

100
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,166
AMERICAN HISTORY X.

101
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:48,136
WE MEET ONCE A DAY.

102
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:50,505
ALL RIGHT. YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT

103
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:53,007
IS TO PREPARE FOR ME A
NEW PAPER DUE TOMORROW.

104
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,392
OH, COME ON, SWEENEY.

105
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,794
IT TOOK ME A WEEK
TO READ<i> MEIN KAMPF.</i>

106
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,345
THAT ISN'T FAIR.

107
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,840
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO IT ON?

108
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,224
YOUR BROTHER.

109
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:13,194
OH, GOD, MAN. PLEASE
TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

110
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:15,597
NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT KIDDING.

111
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,200
I WANT YOU TO ANALYZE AND
INTERPRET ALL THE EVENTS

112
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,002
SURROUNDING DEREK'S
INCARCERATION...

113
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,822
HOW THESE EVENTS HELPED
SHAPE YOUR PRESENT PERSPECTIVE

114
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,075
CONCERNING LIFE IN
CONTEMPORARY AMERICA.

115
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,311
THE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE,

116
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,847
YOUR FAMILY'S.

117
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,001
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY, DANNY.

118
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,574
I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE READING IT.

119
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:48,379
BUT IF IT'S NOT ON MY
DESK TOMORROW MORNING,

120
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,283
YOU ARE A GHOST AT
VENICE BEACH HIGH.

121
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,486
YOU CLEAR?

122
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,022
YEAH, I'M CLEAR.

123
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,046
TELLING TEACHER
I'M FUCKIN' CHEATIN'!

124
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,614
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?

125
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,567
I NEVER CHEATED IN MY LIFE.

126
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,180
BEAT HIS MO'FUCKIN' ASS.

127
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,136
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

128
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,806
WHY YOU TRIPPIN' ON ME?

129
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,360
NOW WHY YOU ALL
KICKING IT LIKE THAT?

130
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,262
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

131
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,947
WHAT YOU SCARED FOR?

132
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,132
I AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHING.

133
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,106
WHAT'S UP?

134
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,909
WANT SOME, TOO, BITCH?!

135
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:37,045
PUNK, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

136
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,412
YOU WANT TO DIE?

137
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,783
PUNK-ASS WHITE BOY.

138
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,925
YOU LUCKY I GOTTA GO TO CLASS.

139
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,638
HE AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHING.

140
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:55,430
HE DON'T WANNA SEE
ME AND THE HEATER.

141
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,310
LUCKY THE BELL RUNG.

142
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,501
I WOULD HAVE CLOCKED
THAT WHITE BOY.

143
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,835
PUNK-ASS MOTHERFUCKER.

144
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,304
SHOULD SMOKE THAT FOOL.

145
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,691
YOU GOTTA FUCKING
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

146
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,603
Cop: WE GOT A WHOLE
FILE ON SKINHEADS HERE.

147
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,122
Second cop: SKINHEADS ALL
PART OF THE SAME GANG?

148
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,256
VENICE BEACH GANG.

149
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,764
Third cop: ACTUALLY, HE'S
DONE A STRETCH AT Y.A.

150
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,666
THIS GUY C.C.,

151
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:33,736
IS THAT HIM?

152
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,170
YEAH, THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE.

153
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,874
THIS MORNING WE HAVE A GUEST
COMING IN, AND THERE HE IS.

154
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,125
GOOD MORNING.

155
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,193
MORNING, SIR.

156
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,661
GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL.

157
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,896
GOOD MORNING.

158
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,964
GENTLEMEN, THIS HERE
IS DR. BOB SWEENEY.

159
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,134
HE'S PRINCIPAL OVER
AT VENICE BEACH HIGH,

160
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,981
AND FOR SOME TIME NOW, HE'S
BEEN DOING OUTREACH WORK

161
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,405
WITH GANGS BOTH IN
AND OUT OF THE CAN.

162
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,341
3 YEARS AGO, A LOCAL
KID NAMED DEREK VINYARD

163
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,476
WAS SENT UP FOR
MURDERING A COUPLE OF CRIPS

164
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,696
WHO WERE TRYING TO JACK HIS CAR.

165
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,192
BOB TAUGHT VINYARD
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

166
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,383
AND HE'S FOLLOWED THE
CASE KIND OF CLOSELY.

167
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,701
HE WAS A SKINHEAD, RIGHT?

168
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,271
HE WAS MORE LIKE <i>THE</i> SKINHEAD...

169
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,473
THE PROTéGé OF
CAMERON ALEXANDER.

170
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,708
WHO?

171
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,109
CAMERON ALEXANDER.

172
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:18,145
HERE YOU GO. HAVE A LOOK-SEE.

173
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,580
CAMERON ALEXANDER, WELL...

174
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,965
HE'S A VENICE BEACH LANDMARK.

175
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,712
HE'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
DISTRIBUTOR AND WRITER

176
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,019
OF WHITE POWER LITERATURE

177
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,303
AND VIDEOS IN L.A. COUNTY.

178
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,440
HE PROMOTES WHITE POWER
BANDS, HE WRITES REVIEWS,

179
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,042
AND IN HIS SPARE TIME,

180
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,543
THIS GUY EVEN
WRITES HATE COLUMNS.

181
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,011
DOES HE HAVE A RECORD?

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,379
HE'S PRETTY CLEAN.

183
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,049
BEEN TRYING TO PIN SOMETHING
TO HIM, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

184
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,751
TRUST ME. HE'S BEHIND ALL OF IT.

185
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,531
HE RUNS EVERYTHING
OUT OF HIS HOUSE

186
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,566
DOWN BY THE BEACH.

187
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,190
THERE WERE NO WHITE
GANGS IN VENICE BEACH

188
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,492
BEFORE CAMERON ALEXANDER
AND DEREK VINYARD HOOKED UP.

189
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,429
ALEXANDER FOUND IN
DEREK HIS SHINING PRINCE.

190
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:54,349
ESSENTIALLY, HE USED
DEREK TO RECRUIT A SLEW

191
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,353
OF INSECURE, FRUSTRATED,
AND IMPRESSIONABLE KIDS.

192
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,489
THIS KID VINYARD, WELL,
HE'S GOT A LOT OF BAGGAGE,

193
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:05,393
AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS TAPE
WE'VE GOTTEN COURTESY OF NBC.

194
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,635
EARLIER TODAY, L.A. COUNTY
FIREFIGHTER DENNIS VINYARD

195
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:17,321
WAS SHOT AND KILLED
BATTLING A BLAZE

196
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,268
AT A SUSPECTED COMPTON DRUG DEN.

197
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,091
WE'RE AT THE VINYARD
HOME RIGHT NOW,

198
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,105
AND LIEUTENANT VINYARD'S
OLDEST SON DEREK

199
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,195
HAS AGREED TO TALK
WITH US FOR A MOMENT.

200
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,309
DEREK, IF YOU COULD
COME DOWN HERE PLEASE

201
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,599
FOR JUST A SECOND.

202
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,635
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH,

203
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,671
BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW?

204
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,173
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

205
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,908
I THINK IT'S TYPICAL.

206
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,143
TYPICAL HOW?

207
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,813
WELL, THIS COUNTRY'S
BECOMING A HAVEN FOR CRIMINALS,

208
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,282
SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

209
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,517
DECENT HARD-WORKING
AMERICANS LIKE MY DAD

210
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,587
ARE GETTING RUBBED
OUT BY SOCIAL PARASITES.

211
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,755
PARASITES?

212
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:55,192
BLACKS, BROWNS,
YELLOW, WHATEVER.

213
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,372
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

214
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,606
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU THINK MAYBE

215
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,874
YOUR FATHER'S MURDER
WAS RACE-RELATED?

216
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,815
YEAH, IT'S RACE-RELATED.

217
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,684
EVERY PROBLEM IN THIS
COUNTRY IS RACE-RELATED.

218
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:06,654
NOT JUST CRIME. IT'S, LIKE,
IMMIGRATION, AIDS, WELFARE...

219
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,723
THOSE ARE PROBLEMS
OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY,

220
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,603
THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY,
THE ASIAN COMMUNITY.

221
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:11,959
THEY'RE NOT WHITE PROBLEMS.

222
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,473
AREN'T THOSE REALLY ISSUES
THAT DEAL MORE WITH POVERTY?

223
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,530
NO. YOU KNOW, NO.

224
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,176
THEY'RE NOT PRODUCTS
OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.

225
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,299
THAT'S CRAP.

226
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,246
MINORITIES DON'T GIVE 2
SHITS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

227
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,286
THEY COME HERE TO
EXPLOIT IT, NOT TO EMBRACE IT.

228
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,565
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO...

229
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,424
MILLIONS OF WHITE EUROPEANS
CAME HERE AND FLOURISHED,

230
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,891
YOU KNOW, WITHIN A GENERATION,

231
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,371
SO WHAT THE FUCK IS THE
MATTER WITH THESE PEOPLE?

232
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,162
THEY HAVE TO GO AROUND
SHOOTING AT FIREMEN?

233
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,809
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO

234
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,243
WITH THE MURDER OF YOUR FATHER?

235
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,635
BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS
MURDERED DOING HIS JOB!

236
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,070
PUTTING OUT A FIRE IN A
FUCKING NIGGER NEIGHBORHOOD

237
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,684
HE SHOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE GIVEN A SHIT ABOUT.

238
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,907
HE GOT SHOT BY A
FUCKING DRUG DEALER

239
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,587
WHO PROBABLY STILL
COLLECTS A WELFARE CHECK.

240
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,651
THAT'S ENOUGH.

241
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,613
DEREK VINYARD WAS
QUIETLY RELEASED FROM CHINO

242
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,715
EARLY THIS MORNING

243
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,950
AFTER SERVING 3
AND SOME ODD YEARS.

244
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,736
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
WE GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON.

245
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,338
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM,

246
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,441
THINGS COULD GET VERY
UGLY DOWN BY THE BEACH.

247
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,625
JUST KEEP IT LOW.

248
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,997
Danny: VENICE BEACH DIDN'T
ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS.

249
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,766
IT USED TO BE A
GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

250
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,801
THE BOARDWALK'S
ALWAYS BEEN A DUMP,

251
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,004
BUT WHEN MY DAD
MOVED US OUT HERE,

252
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,355
VENICE WAS A NICE,
QUIET PLACE TO GROW UP.

253
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,111
OVER THE YEARS, THOUGH,
IT'S JUST GONE TO HELL.

254
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,113
THE GANGS ARE LIKE A PLAGUE.

255
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,098
THEY MOVED WEST FROM INGLEWOOD

256
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,667
AND SOUTH CENTRAL,

257
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,855
AND BASICALLY TOOK OVER.

258
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,600
I AIN'T FOULIN' YOU!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

259
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,895
I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR
ALL THIS BULLSHIT.

260
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,363
FUCK Y'ALL.

261
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,542
YOU ALL RIGHT?

262
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,249
I'M ALL RIGHT.

263
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,086
HEY, YO, IS THAT THAT FOOL
YOU WAS TELLING ME ABOUT?

264
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,163
YEAH, THAT'S THAT MOTHERFUCKER.

265
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,747
YEAH, MAN, THAT'S HIM.

266
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,908
BITCH ASS MOTHERFUCKER.

267
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,110
Danny: THAT'S WHY
DEREK STARTED THE D.O.C.

268
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,247
HE SAID WHITE KIDS SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO WALK AROUND SCARED

269
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:15,783
IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND FOR A WHILE THERE,

270
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,652
WE REALLY MADE IT
LIKE IT WAS OURS AGAIN.

271
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,305
THROW THE BALL, THROW THE BALL!

272
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,940
COME ON, CURTIS!

273
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,827
QUIT CHUCKING IT
UP. PASS THE BALL.

274
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,596
"D" UP!

275
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,008
Cameron: COME ON,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

276
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,567
Derek: LOOK AT THIS
FUCKING JUNGLE BUNNY.

277
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,303
HE DOES A SPIN MOVE
EVERY TIME. EVERY TIME.

278
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:37,983
YOU AIN'T GETTIN'
SHIT, MOTHERFUCKER.

279
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,407
YOU AIN'T GETTIN' SHIT.

280
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,626
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, BOY!

281
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,695
WHAT THE FUCK YOU...

282
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,809
WHO YOU CALLIN'
BOY, MOTHERFUCKER?

283
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,073
YOU'RE LUCKY, MOTHERFUCKER!

284
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,245
I'M THROUGH MONKEYING
AROUND WITH YOUR FUCKING ASS!

285
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,137
PALE, PASTY, PASTRAMI-EATING,
CRACKER MOTHERFUCKER.

286
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,872
100 BUCKS SAY I
MAKE YOU MY BITCH.

287
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,609
HEAR THAT?

288
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,072
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

289
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,377
FOR HIS CUT IN WELFARE.
YOU'RE FUCKING ON!

290
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,833
IT'S 8-6, SETH.

291
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,584
DANNY, WHEN I WANT
YOUR FUCKING OPINION,

292
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,719
I'LL ASK FOR IT. COME ON,
GUYS. I CAN'T COVER THIS.

293
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,820
HELP ME OUT HERE.

294
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,232
YOU GOT A BIG
FUCKING MOUTH, SETH.

295
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,323
I CAN TAKE THIS NIGLET DOWN.

296
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,536
SETH, YOU COULDN'T TAKE A SHIT.

297
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,938
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?

298
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,322
I WILL BEAT HIM.
GIVE ME THE MONEY.

299
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,696
SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

300
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,084
YOU'RE GONNA FUCKING
EMBARRASS US. SHUT UP!

301
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,741
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

302
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,709
Man: YO, I AIN'T
GOT TIME FOR THIS.

303
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:33,794
Derek: HEY!

304
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,297
I GOT A BET.

305
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,534
I COME IN THIS GAME
RIGHT NOW. SAME SCORE,

306
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:43,070
BUT WE PLAY BLACK GUYS
AGAINST THE WHITE GUYS.

307
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,541
YEAH?

308
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,255
NAME YOUR PRICE, CRACKER.

309
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,345
NO MONEY, NO MONEY.

310
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,813
FOR THESE COURTS.

311
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,749
AND NOT JUST TODAY... FOR GOOD.

312
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,850
IF YOU WIN, WE WILL WALK AWAY,

313
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,788
BUT IF WE WIN, NO
BITCHING, NO FIGHTING.

314
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,823
RIGHT HERE IN
FRONT OF EVERYBODY,

315
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,824
YOU PACK UP YOUR SHIT

316
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,876
AND GET YOUR BLACK
ASSES OUT OF HERE.

317
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,611
FUCK THAT. TAKE THIS BET.

318
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,179
8 TO 6. OUR BALL.

319
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,680
LET'S GO.

320
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,742
YES! WHOO!

321
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,683
Derek: PICK HIM UP! PICK HIM UP!

322
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,064
SETH, GET BACK
AND PLAY SOME "D."

323
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,742
DEFENSE!

324
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,232
ALL RIGHT!

325
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,452
PASS THE FUCKING
BALL! I WAS WIDE OPEN!

326
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,396
Seth: BULLSHIT, MAN.
THAT'S FUCKIN' OFFENSE.

327
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,198
MAN, GET THE FUCK OUT
OF HERE. HE MOVED HIS FEET.

328
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,799
YOU WANT TO GO, I'M READY!

329
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,234
DON'T BE THROWING
FUCKING ELBOWS AT ME!

330
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,625
YOU WANT TO GO, ADOLF HITLER
WANNABE MOTHERFUCKER?

331
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,105
YOU OK?

332
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,584
YEAH. JUST GIVE ME SOME WATER.

333
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,642
YOU GOTTA CALL OFFENSE
ON THAT SHIT, DER.

334
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,504
NOT ON GAME POINT, DANNY.

335
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:47,773
FUCK THAT. YOU CAN'T
LET THOSE NIGGERS

336
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,797
GET AWAY WITH THAT SHIT.

337
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,875
HONEY, IT'S GAME POINT.

338
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,699
SHUT 'EM DOWN,
DEREK. KICK SOME ASS.

339
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,467
WATCH THIS.

340
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
YEAH!

341
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,872
BYE-BYE.

342
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,818
GET THE FUCK OFF MY COURT!

343
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,042
THIS IS MY HOUSE!

344
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,277
FUCK YOU, BITCH!

345
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,811
WHOO!

346
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,468
YEAH.

347
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,410
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

348
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,926
THIS IS MY COURT!

349
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,994
YES!

350
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,905
Danny: DEREK WOULDN'T
LET US VISIT HIM IN PRISON.

351
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,658
HE SAID IT WOULD MAKE
IT JUST TOO HARD FOR HIM,

352
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,761
AND THAT IF WE CAME, HE
WOULDN'T SEE US ANYHOW.

353
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,498
3 YEARS WITHOUT
HIM, JUST WONDERING.

354
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,319
Danny: AND THEN AT
7:00 THIS MORNING,

355
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,123
WE PICKED HIM UP
OUTSIDE THE GATE.

356
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,227
DER.

357
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,681
Danny: THE WHOLE RIDE
BACK, HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

358
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,277
I WANTED TO STAY
HOME, BUT HE SAID, "NO.

359
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,101
GO TO SCHOOL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER."

360
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,001
OH, COME ON.

361
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,301
GIVE THE GUY A BREAK.

362
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,381
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

363
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,282
YOU TOO BIG TO GIVE
ME A HUG, TOUGH GUY?

364
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,340
NO, MAN. I JUST KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE

365
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,303
TO LOOK AFTER YOU WHILE
YOU ADJUST TO ALL THIS SPACE.

366
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,426
YEAH, RIGHT.

367
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,325
THIS PLACE IS SMALLER
THAN THE OLD LIVING ROOM.

368
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,060
HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S SCHOOL?

369
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,634
IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD.

370
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,702
YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT HAIR, MAN.

371
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,204
THAT DO'S GOTTA GO.

372
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,683
I DON'T KNOW. THE
GIRLS LIKE IT, SO...

373
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,739
WELL, I DON'T.

374
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,353
YOU'RE KEEPING IT PRETTY CLOSE.

375
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,194
YOU TOOK IT ALL
THE WAY DOWN, HUH?

376
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,163
SHIT. LOOK. I FORGOT, MAN.

377
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,767
IT HURT LIKE SHIT WHILE
THEY WERE PUTTING IT ON.

378
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,735
WHEN'D YOU GET THAT?

379
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:44,004
I GOT IT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

380
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,339
CAMERON MADE IT OFFICIAL.

381
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,408
CAMERON?

382
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,774
YEAH.

383
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,295
HE PUT THIS ON YOU?

384
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,629
MM-HMM. YEAH.

385
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,568
Davina: HELLO?

386
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,552

387
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,021
Davina: OH, HI. HE'S HERE.

388
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,723

389
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,724
NOTHING.

390
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:05,125
NOTHING.

391
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,578
I'M GONNA GRAB IT. IS
THERE A PHONE IN THE BACK?

392
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,213
I'LL GET IT IN THE BACK.

393
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,821
I GOT IT.

394
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,155

GOD, WHAT'S WITH THE

409
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,153
NO, NO. HE'LL DO IT.

HE'LL DO IT. I'LL MAKE
SURE HE DOES IT.

Davina: I'LL GET IT.

412
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,631
I CAME TO SEE THE MAN.

413
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,278
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN FIT
THROUGH THE FUCKING DOOR?

414
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:20,934
FUCK YOU!

415
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:22,869

416
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,938
Seth: WHAT'S UP, DAN?

417
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,957
HOW YOU DOING? WHERE'S DEREK?

418
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,026
HE'S ON THE PHONE.

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,788
COME OUT, YOU FREE MOTHERFUCKER!

420
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,439

00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,297

423
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,832
Seth: VINYARD!

I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

425
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,734
I'LL BE CAREFUL.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

426
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,621
I'M NOT GONNA STAY IN MY
ROOM THE REST OF MY LIFE.

427
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,255
HOLD ON.

428
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,257

00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,830
NO. HE ALWAYS COMES OVER HERE.

432
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:10,951
DANNY, GIVE ME A MINUTE.

433
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,086
JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.

00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:24,132
YEAH.

ABLE TO SEE YOUR FEET?

439
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,938
COME IN HERE, DANNY.

00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,240
HEY, MAN, ARE YOU GOING

YOU'RE FUCKING SICK, MAN.

444
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,536
ALL RIGHT, RELAX. LET ME
ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

445
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,849
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD. I

446
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,674
TELL ME SOME OF THE SHIT
YOU'VE LEARNED, FUCKASS,

447
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,375
BEFORE I PISTOL-WHIP YOU.

448
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,496
OK. I BELIEVE IN
DEATH, DESTRUCTION,

449
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,731
CHAOS, FILTH, AND GREED.

450
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,834
CUT THE SHIT, DAN. COME ON.

451
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,535
TELL ME WHAT I WANT
TO HEAR, ASSHOLE.

452
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:21,538
YOU MEAN THAT SHIT
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER, MAN?

453
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,340
YOU WANT TO GET
FUCKING BEATEN, DANNY?

454
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,278
I'M NOT FUCKING

455
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,546
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?

456
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:34,017
LOOK, YOU GOTTA LET ME DO
THIS MY OWN WAY, ALL RIGHT?

457
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,752
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,220
WHO DO YOU HATE, DANNY?

459
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,891
I HATE ANYONE THAT
ISN'T WHITE PROTESTANT.

460
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
WHY?

461
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,538
THEY'RE A BURDEN
TO THE ADVANCEMENT

462
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,661
OF THE WHITE RACE.

463
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,941
SOME OF THEM ARE ALL RIGHT.

464
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,247
NONE OF THEM ARE FUCKING
ALL RIGHT, DANNY, OK?

465
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:51,518
THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF
FUCKING FREELOADERS.

466
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:52,604
REMEMBER WHAT CAM SAID?

467
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,072
WE DON'T KNOW 'EM. WE
DON'T WANT TO KNOW 'EM.

468
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,673
THEY'RE THE FUCKING ENEMY.

469
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,409
NOW WHAT DON'T
YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM,

470
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,361
AND SAY IT WITH SOME
FUCKING CONVICTION.

471
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,229
I HATE THE FACT THAT IT'S COOL

472
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,631
TO BE BLACK THESE DAYS.

473
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,649
Seth: GOOD.

I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU, DANNY.

486
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:30,334
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE

IS THAT ANY WAY

491
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,847
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY?

492
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:38,848
DEREK HATES YOU,

493
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,095
AND YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

494
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,619
HEY, HEY, HOW DO YOU

516
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,121

SWEENEY'S A GOOD
TEACHER, ALL RIGHT?

527
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,225
SWEENEY IS A NIGGER
ON A POWER TRIP.

528
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,327
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS
LIKE WHEN WE WERE THERE,

529
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,896
AND THAT'S HOW HE IS NOW.

530
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,852
SETH!

531
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,031
FUCK THAT NIGGER!

532
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,121
SETH, GO AWAY.

533
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,200
ARE YOU KIDDING?

534
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,857
NOPE. GO WAIT IN DANNY'S ROOM.

535
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,570
I WANT TO TALK TO MY
BROTHER. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

536
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,071
I'VE BEEN HERE 15
FUCKING MINUTES.

537
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,428
HURRY UP. I'M STARVING.

538
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:05,318
COME HERE. SERIOUSLY, LOOK,

539
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,498
FORGET THIS YAHOO, ALL RIGHT?

540
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:07,454
HE KILLS BUGS FOR A LIVING.

541
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,455
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THAT.

542
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,456
NO.

543
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,057
I'M SERIOUS. IT'S NOT FUNNY.

544
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:13,426
SWEENEY IS A GOOD TEACHER.
YOU CAN LEARN A LOT FROM HIM,

545
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,679
SO DON'T GO FUCK IT UP
WITH SMALL FRY SHIT LIKE THAT.

546
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:16,680
YOU GOT TO BE SMARTER THAN THAT.

547
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,126
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MAN.

548
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,294
YOU GOT TO SEE THE BULLSHIT
PAPER HE'S MAKING ME WRITE.

549
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,630
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.

550
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,802
I DON'T CARE.

551
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,921
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT.

552
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,633
YOU DO ANYTHING HE
TELLS YOU TO DO. I MEAN IT.

553
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,674
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
IN TROUBLE IN SCHOOL

554
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,742
TRYING TO IMPRESS ME

555
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,077
TAKING THIS SHIT
IN THERE, ALL RIGHT?

556
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,879
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

557
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:34,659
YEAH, I GUESS, BUT, I MEAN...

558
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:36,861
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

559
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:37,885
WELL, I'M NOT.

560
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:40,671
SHH.

561
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,739
LISTEN TO THAT.

562
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,909
YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S BEEN
GETTING WORSE, MAN.

563
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,388
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

564
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,172
I'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THIS LATER, ALL RIGHT?

565
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,294
OK.

566
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,184
HEY, SHE'S COUGHING
HER LUNGS OUT,

567
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,797
AND YOU'RE BLOWING THIS
SHIT IN HER FACE ALL DAY.

568
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,753
PUT IT OUT.

569
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:57,754
I'M PUTTING IT OUT.

570
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:58,823
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

571
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,457
HEY...

572
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,359
COME ON, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

573
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,831
Ally: MOMMY,

574
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,999
ARE YOU OK?

575
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,937
OH.

576
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:16,539
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING? PUT THAT OUT.

577
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,641
I WAS JUST YELLING AT HIM

578
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,853
FOR BLOWING SMOKE IN YOUR FACE,

579
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,810
AND YOU'RE IN
HERE SUCKING ON IT.

580
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,828
NICE THING TO COME HOME TO, HUH?

581
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:22,897
YEAH.

582
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,599
YOU ALL RIGHT?

583
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:27,968
YOU ALL RIGHT?

584
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:35,742
LOOK...

585
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,210
YOU GOT TO TAKE
IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?

586
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,644
YOU GOT TO GET SOME REST.

587
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:39,858
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
DANNY'S AND MY ROOM,

588
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:40,813
AND WE'LL HIT THE COUCH.

589
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:42,793
NO. I'VE BEEN ON
THE COUCH FOR AGES.

590
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,750
THE COUCH IS FINE.

591
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,118
NO, IT'S NOT FINE. IT'S NOT.

592
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:47,854
THIS IS TERRIBLE. WE
CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

593
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:51,557
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

594
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:54,327
Ally: CAN I GO WITH YOU?

595
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:56,107
YEAH. YEAH, WE ALL
GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

596
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:57,063
THAT'S THE POINT.

597
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,831
I COULD DROP OUT OF
SCHOOL AND GET A JOB.

598
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,733
NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

599
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,962
YOU GOT TO FINISH. I'LL
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

600
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,825
DEREK, CAN WE PLEASE GO EAT?

601
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,061
I'M FUCKING STARVING
HERE. I MEAN...

602
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,010
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT. GO
WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM.

603
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,344
I WANT HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE.

604
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,734
I KNOW. LOOK...

605
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,318
HE'S AN IDIOT.

606
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,097
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN IDIOT.

607
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,521
WHATEVER, DUDE.
HE CAN'T HELP IT.

608
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,788
I GOT TO DO THAT PAPER.

609
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,157
LOOK, I'M GOING TO CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER TONIGHT AT...

610
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,254
HEY, HEY, NOT AT
CAMERON'S HOUSE.

611
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:44,355
I NEED YOU TO STAY
AWAY FROM THERE.

612
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,090
BUT WHY, MAN? I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO HANG.

613
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:47,859
TRUST ME. I WILL
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU LATER.

614
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,483
I JUST NEED YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE PARTY, ALL RIGHT?

615
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,484
WHATEVER.

616
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,752
HEY, I'M NOT KIDDING.

617
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:53,898
PROMISE ME YOU'RE
GOING TO STAY AWAY

618
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:55,166
FROM THAT PARTY TONIGHT, DANNY.

619
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,323
I'M NOT FUCKING 14
ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

620
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,893
WHATEVER.

621
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,930
GOD!

622
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,603
COME ON, LET'S GO.

623
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,657
WHERE ARE YOU PARKED?

624
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,885
OUT BACK.

625
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,723
YEAH, THAT'S THE WHOLE BUNCH.

626
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,064
Danny: IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG

627
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,044
FOR DEREK TO MAKE
A NAME FOR HIMSELF,

628
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,435
AND CAMERON KNEW
JUST HOW TO USE IT.

629
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,565
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO STICK AROUND?

630
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:35,455
OH, YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO,

631
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:37,657
BUT I GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

632
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:39,559
YEAH, I KNOW.

633
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,972
I'LL SEE YOU BACK
AT THE HOUSE, THEN?

634
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,036
RIGHT.

635
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:43,996
ALL RIGHT.

636
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:44,997
GOOD LUCK.

637
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,200
Danny: HE SENT
DEREK TO THE KIDS...

638
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:49,018
TO THE FRUSTRATED ONES...

639
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,932
THE ONES WHO WERE SICK OF
GETTING THEIR ASSES KICKED

640
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,323
BY BLACK AND MEXICAN GANGS.

641
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,024
"DON'T JUST BE SOME PUNK.

642
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,225
BE PART OF SOMETHING."

643
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,861
Derek: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

644
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,128
PULL IT TOGETHER.

645
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,877
Danny: AND EVERYBODY ATE IT UP.

646
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,199
THEY DID WHATEVER
DEREK TOLD THEM TO.

647
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,268
HEY, LET'S GO. COME ON.

648
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,737
WE'RE NOT HERE TO
FUCKING SOCIALIZE.

649
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,623
Man: SHUT THE FUCK UP.

650
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,890
Man: YEAH, MAN.

651
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,303
Man: YOU WANT A LITTLE TOKE?

652
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,693
HUH?

653
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:15,228
GO AHEAD.

654
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:16,297
CURTIS, WHAT IS THAT?

655
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,764
AW, COME ON, DEREK.

656
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:20,567
WEED IS FOR NIGGERS.
PUT THAT AWAY RIGHT NOW.

657
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:22,247
AW, JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.

658
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:23,202
HAVE A LITTLE SELF-RESPECT.

659
00:35:23,272 --> 00:35:24,738
Man: YEAH.

660
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,139
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

661
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,608
WE NEED TO OPEN OUR EYES.

662
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,646
THERE'S OVER 2 MILLION
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

663
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,114
BEDDING DOWN IN
THIS STATE TONIGHT.

664
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:40,219
THIS STATE SPENT
$3 BILLION LAST YEAR

665
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:41,699
ON SERVICES FOR THOSE PEOPLE

666
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,635
WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO BE
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE...

667
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,224
$3 BILLION.

668
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:47,394
$400 MILLION JUST TO LOCK UP

669
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,763
A BUNCH OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANT CRIMINALS

670
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,747
WHO ONLY GOT INTO THIS COUNTRY

671
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,627
BECAUSE THE FUCKING INS DECIDED

672
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,553
IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO
SCREEN FOR CONVICTED FELONS.

673
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:00,790
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

674
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,698
OUR GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

675
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,195
OUR BORDER POLICY IS A JOKE,

676
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,947
SO IS ANYBODY SURPRISED

677
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:10,600
THAT SOUTH OF THE BORDER
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US?

678
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,601
LAUGHING AT OUR LAWS?

679
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,602
YEAH.

680
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,448
EVERY NIGHT, THOUSANDS
OF THESE PARASITES

681
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,638
STREAM ACROSS THE BORDER

682
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,418
LIKE SOME FUCKING
PIÑATA EXPLODED.

683
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,442
DON'T LAUGH.

684
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,055
THERE'S NOTHING
FUNNY GOING ON HERE.

685
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,879
THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR LIFE AND MINE.

686
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,583
IT'S ABOUT DECENT,
HARD-WORKING AMERICANS

687
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,529
FALLING THROUGH THE
CRACKS AND GETTING THE SHAFT

688
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,564
BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNMENT

689
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,532
CARES MORE ABOUT THE
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

690
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,488
OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

691
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,958
WHO AREN'T EVEN
CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY.

692
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,403
ON THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY IT SAYS,

693
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,095
"GIVE ME YOUR TIRED,
YOUR HUNGRY, YOUR POOR."

694
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,798
WELL, IT'S AMERICANS WHO ARE
TIRED AND HUNGRY AND POOR,

695
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,544
AND I SAY UNTIL YOU
TAKE CARE OF THAT,

696
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,734
CLOSE THE FUCKING BOOK,

697
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,936
BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING.

698
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,574
WE'RE LOSING OUR RIGHT
TO PURSUE OUR DESTINY.

699
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,409
WE'RE LOSING OUR FREEDOM

700
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,089
SO THAT A BUNCH OF
FUCKING FOREIGNERS

701
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,246
CAN COME IN HERE AND
EXPLOIT OUR COUNTRY.

702
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,433
AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING ON FAR AWAY.

703
00:37:00,502 --> 00:37:01,779
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT'S HAPPENING

704
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,514
PLACES WE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

705
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:04,982
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE...

706
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:05,938
RIGHT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

707
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,074
RIGHT IN THAT
BUILDING BEHIND YOU.

708
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,654
ARCHIE MILLER RAN
THAT GROCERY STORE

709
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,578
SINCE WE WERE KIDS HERE.

710
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,480
DAVE WORKED THERE.
MIKE WORKED THERE.

711
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,927
HE WENT UNDER, AND NOW
SOME FUCKING KOREAN OWNS IT,

712
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,384
WHO FIRED THESE GUYS

713
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,463
AND IS MAKING A KILLING

714
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,788
BECAUSE HE HIRED 40
FUCKING BORDER JUMPERS.

715
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,224
I SEE THIS SHIT GOING ON,

716
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,304
AND I DON'T SEE ANYBODY
DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

717
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,094
AND IT FUCKING PISSES ME OFF.

718
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,215
SO LOOK AROUND YOU.

719
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,551
THIS ISN'T OUR FUCKING
NEIGHBORHOOD.

720
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,552
IT'S A BATTLEFIELD.

721
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,654
WE'RE ON A BATTLEFIELD TONIGHT.

722
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:38,723
MAKE A DECISION.

723
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,924
ARE WE GOING TO
STAND ON THE SIDELINES?

724
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,059
QUIETLY STANDING THERE

725
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,505
WHILE OUR COUNTRY GETS RAPED?

726
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,628
Crowd: NO!

727
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,281
ARE WE GOING TO ANTE UP
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

728
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,966
YEAH!

729
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,634
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT, WE ARE.

730
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,560
AAH!

731
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,131
COME HERE!

732
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,694
DON'T YOU KNOW
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW

733
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,179
TO HIRE FUCKING BORDER JUMPERS,

734
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,302
YOU NIP BASTARD?

735
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,070
UHH! UHH! AAH!

736
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,010
HEY, SWEETHEART.

737
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,562
NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T NEED THIS.

738
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,807
YOU DON'T NEED THIS. WE'RE
NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

739
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,298
PLEASE, PLEASE! NO!

740
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,299
NO!

741
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,284
AAH! AAH!

742
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,464
YOU FUCKING SPIC!

743
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:27,554
HA!

744
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,973
NO! PLEASE!

745
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,186
I THINK THIS BITCH DESERVES IT.

746
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,520
OH, MAN, THIS BITCH STINKS.

747
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,429
SHE SMELLS LIKE FISH
AND CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE.

748
00:38:36,498 --> 00:38:37,913
AH, HERE WE GO.

749
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,082
AAH!

750
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,302
Man: AAH! AAH!

751
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,610
GODDAMN!

752
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,715
Man: GET THE FUCK
OFF ME, MOTHERFUCKER!

753
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:00,437
GO!

754
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,549
GET DOWN!

755
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,573
UHH!

756
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,008
VIVA LA MEXICO!

757
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,310
VIVA LA MEXICO!

758
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,062
VIVA LA MEXICO!

759
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,009
HAVE A FUCKING BEAN,
YOU FUCKING BEANER!

760
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,316
YEAH!

761
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,767
YOU FUCKING DOGGY DICK!

762
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,819
Man: GET SOME OF
THAT IN THERE. MMM.

763
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:23,076
THROW IT ON. THROW IT ON.

764
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:25,073
HEY, THAT'S A GREAT
COLOR ON YOU, YOU KNOW?

765
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,996
NOW YOU CAN GET A
WHITE WOMAN'S JOB, BITCH.

766
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,342
A LITTLE BETTER
THAN THIS ONE, HUH?

767
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,033
YEAH.

768
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,034
WHITE.

769
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,146
THEN YOU'LL MOVE
UP IN THE WORLD, HUH?

770
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,204
YEAH. WHOO!

771
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,521
ASSHOLE!

772
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,490
UHH!

773
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,686
Derek: COME ON, LET'S
GO! WE'RE OUT OF HERE!

774
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,270
EVERYBODY OUT! LET'S GO!

775
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,677
NOW! NOW!

776
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,616
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

777
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,151
COME ON!

778
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,930
COME ON, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

779
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:50,954
LET'S GO!

780
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:57,010
NO GREEN CARD, NO FUCKING WORK,

781
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,144
<i>COMPRENDE?</i>

782
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:01,814
Man: COME ON, COME ON!

783
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:02,815
Man: GO, GO, GO!

784
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:04,484
WE'RE FUCKING GOING! COME ON!

785
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:31,744
Danny: DAD WAS GONE,

786
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,113
BUT THINGS WERE
ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN.

787
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,882
DEREK HAD A GOOD JOB.

788
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,683
MOM WAS STARTING
TO LIVE A LITTLE.

789
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:39,329
EVERYONE WAS FEELING SO GOOD

790
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,987
THAT WE JUST
DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

791
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:43,756
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE.

792
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:46,108
THE IRONY IS THAT
MOST OF THE STORES

793
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,643
THAT WERE DESTROYED
DURING THE RIOTS

794
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,789
WERE OWNED BY BLACK PEOPLE.

795
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,079
THAT'S STUPID, THOUGH.

796
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,926
I MEAN, WHY TRASH YOUR
OWN NEIGHBORHOOD?

797
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,060
WELL, THAT'S MY POINT.

798
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,884
IT'S AN IRRATIONAL ACT.

799
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,052
IT'S LIKE AN EXPRESSION OF RAGE

800
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,799
BY PEOPLE WHO FEEL NEGLECTED

801
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,023
AND TURNED AWAY BY THE SYSTEM.

802
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,008
EXACTLY.

803
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:03,988
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
WE HAD IN WATTS

804
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,628
OR THE RIOTS IN CHICAGO IN '68.

805
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,226
THAT'S CRAP. I DON'T
BUY THAT FOR A MINUTE.

806
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,916
CALLING A RIOT AN IRRATIONAL
EXPRESSION OF RAGE...

807
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,051
THAT'S SUCH A COP-OUT.

808
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,620
IT'S OPPORTUNISM AT ITS WORST.

809
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:14,621
IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

810
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,933
GRABBING ANY
EXCUSE THEY CAN FIND

811
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:16,889
TO GO AND LOOT A STORE,

812
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,374
NOTHING MORE.

813
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,153
THE FACT THAT THESE
PEOPLE RIPPED OFF THE STORES

814
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,093
IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES,

815
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:22,094
ALL THAT REFLECTS

816
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,241
IS THE DEGREE TO
WHICH THESE PEOPLE

817
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:25,064
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
RESPECT FOR THE LAW AT ALL

818
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,734
AND CERTAINLY NO
CONCEPT OF, LIKE, COMMUNITY

819
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,435
OR... OR CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY.

820
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:30,637
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

821
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,205
WHITE PEOPLE COMMIT CRIMES
AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE, TOO.

822
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:35,675
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NOT OFFING
EACH OTHER IN RECORD NUMBERS

823
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,744
ALL OVER AMERICA.

824
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:38,711
LOOK AT THE STATISTICS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

825
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,913
ONE IN EVERY THREE BLACK MALES

826
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:43,298
IS IN SOME PHASE OF A
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM.

827
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,433
IS THAT A COINCIDENCE,

828
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,779
OR DO THESE PEOPLE
HAVE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

829
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,469
A RACIAL COMMITMENT TO CRIME?

830
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,805
WELL, NOT ONLY THAT.
THEY'RE PROUD OF IT.

831
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,019
MAYBE IT SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT PREJUDICE

832
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,220
IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

833
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,105
YEAH. IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT CRIMINAL STATISTICS,

834
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,173
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK

835
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:59,015
AT THE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES
THAT PRODUCE THEM.

836
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,145
YAP, YAP. YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HATE,

837
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:03,030
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS TAKING ONE THING

838
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,265
AND CALLING IT SOMETHING ELSE

839
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,554
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,

840
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,901
ALLEVIATING THE RESPONSIBILITY

841
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,286
THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE
FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS.

842
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,942
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SAYING,

843
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:11,739
IT'S NOT A RIOT, IT'S RAGE.

844
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,340
IT'S NOT CRIME, IT'S POVERTY.

845
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,530
THAT'S JUST NONSENSE.

846
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,631
IT'S BULLSHIT.

847
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,277
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED IN THIS TRIAL, TOO,

848
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,079
BECAUSE THE MEDIA
TWISTED THINGS AROUND

849
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,614
SO PEOPLE GOT ALL FOCUSED ON,

850
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,737
YOU KNOW, THESE COPS

851
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,150
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY
WERE GOING TO GET CONVICTED

852
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,218
AND WHETHER RODNEY
KING'S CIVIL RIGHTS

853
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,308
HAD BEEN VIOLATED.

854
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,589
EVERYBODY LOST SIGHT OF
OLD RODNEY KING HIMSELF.

855
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,646
I MEAN, THE GUY'S
A MULTIPLE FELON

856
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,715
BY HIS OWN ADMISSION.

857
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,549
HE'S HIGH AS A GODDAMN KITE

858
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:36,251
DRIVING 120 MILES AN
HOUR DOWN THE HIGHWAY.

859
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
HE GETS PULLED OVER
BY A BUNCH OF COPS,

860
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,956
AND... AND HE ATTACKS THEM.

861
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,201
HE ATTACKED POLICE OFFICERS.

862
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,687
THAT'S THE BOTTOM
LINE, AND HE WALKED.

863
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,388
YEAH, AND THERE'S
SOME YAHOO THERE

864
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,422
WITH A VIDEO CAMERA

865
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:46,378
WHO TURNED IT ON
HALFWAY THROUGH,

866
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:48,826
SO THAT ALL WE SEE
IS THEM HITTING HIM.

867
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,717
EXACTLY. YOU GOT POWELL AND KOON

868
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,496
WINDING UP AND CRACKING
HIM WITH BILLY CLUBS

869
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,754
AND BRISENO'S KICKING HIM
IN THE BACK OF THE SKULL,

870
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,189
SO IT LOOKS SEVERE, YOU KNOW?

871
00:42:56,257 --> 00:42:57,568
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING,
"OH, THIS POOR GUY."

872
00:42:57,592 --> 00:42:59,558
THIS POOR GUY WHO
ATTACKED 4 COPS,

873
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,427
AND THOSE COPS
END UP ON THE STAND

874
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,762
DEFENDING THEMSELVES

875
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,997
FOR USING ABSOLUTELY
STANDARD TEXTBOOK

876
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:06,066
SELF-DEFENSE PROCEDURES.

877
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:08,245
I DON'T THINK THE TAPES
SHOWED THAT AT ALL.

878
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,435
OH, YOU DIDN'T THINK SO, HUH?

879
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,337
AND, WHAT, YOU'RE
AN AUTHORITY, MA?

880
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,904
MURRAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

881
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,476
WELL, I... I DID THINK
THAT THE POLICE

882
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,712
USED THEIR CLUBS
RATHER EXCESSIVELY.

883
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:21,058
WHO ARE YOU TO SAY
WHAT'S EXCESSIVE?

884
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,715
I THINK IT WAS
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.

885
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,261
I THINK THEY'RE IN
A BETTER POSITION

886
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:25,845
TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT
CALL THAN YOU ARE.

887
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:27,687
IN FACT, WE, AS SOCIETY,

888
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:29,555
GRANT COPS A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY

889
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:30,656
TO MAKE THOSE CALLS,

890
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:31,891
BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE

891
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,126
THAT THEIR JOB IS
DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS,

892
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,295
YOU KNOW? UNFORTUNATELY,
VERY FEW PEOPLE, LIKE,

893
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,030
RESPECT THAT AND
RESPECT THAT AUTHORITY.

894
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,017
LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT
RESPECT... MR. JUNIOR KKK.

895
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,085
WHAT?

896
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,265
YOU WANT TO GO
TO COLLEGE, DAVINA,

897
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,222
YOU SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN.

898
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:48,074
DEREK. DEREK.

899
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,603
I ACKNOWLEDGE A COP'S AUTHORITY.

900
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,559
I DON'T RESPECT ANY LAWS

901
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,006
THAT LET MONKEYS
LIKE RODNEY KING

902
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,129
BACK ON THE STREET.

903
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,075
SECOND OF ALL, I AM
NOT, AS YOU WELL KNOW,

904
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,465
A MEMBER OF A LOW-RENT,

905
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,012
DISORGANIZED BUNCH OF REDNECKS

906
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:00,686
LIKE THE FUCKING KKK. PLEASE.

907
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:03,422
SO TAKE YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR ASS.

908
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:05,274
YOU'VE GOTTEN OFF THE POINT.

909
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,876
I HAD A POINT. THAT
WASN'T EVEN THE POINT.

910
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,829
DO YOU HAVE ONE? WHAT
IS YOUR POINT, DEREK?

911
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,842
ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT
THIS. THINK ABOUT THIS.

912
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:12,943
IF DANNY HAD BEEN WALKING

913
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,211
ACROSS THE STREET THAT NIGHT,

914
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,479
AND RODNEY KING
HAD PLOWED INTO HIM...

915
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:17,703
CAN WE JUST DROP
THIS RODNEY KING THING?

916
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:19,606
MM-HMM.

917
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,118
WHO WOULD LIKE SOME DESSERT?

918
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:31,908
WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION.

919
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,287
WE'RE HAVING A NICE
DISCUSSION, RIGHT?

920
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,466
IF RODNEY KING HAD
BEEN DRIVING ALONG

921
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,323
HOPPED UP ON
CHIVAS REGAL AND PCP

922
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,324
AND HAD KILLED DANNY,

923
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:39,325
YOU'D BE SINGING A
VERY DIFFERENT TUNE...

924
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:41,371
I DIDN'T SEE HIM HIT ANYBODY,

925
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:42,328
AND NEITHER DID YOU.

926
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:43,996
HE DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO KILL ANYBODY,

927
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:45,013
THANK GOD.

928
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,450
KEEP IT DOWN, OK?
ALLY'S SLEEPING.

929
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,166
IF HE HAD, THOUGH, I MEAN,
COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT.

930
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,168
IF THAT FUCKING MONKEY
HAD RUN SOME KID OVER,

931
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,136
EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE
A VERY DIFFERENT OPINION

932
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,359
OF THIS WHOLE MATTER.

933
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,239
YOU KNOW, THEY'D BE
FOCUSED ON RODNEY KING

934
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,196
AND NOT ON THESE OFFICERS.

935
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,130
BUT INSTEAD,

936
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,709
HE JUST ATTACKED A FEW COPS,

937
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,478
AND SO, ALL THE SUDDEN,
IT'S HANDS ACROSS AMERICA

938
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,535
FOR THIS FUCKING
TOTAL SON OF A BITCH.

939
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:07,970
I MEAN, IT BLOWS MY MIND.

940
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,516
WE'RE SO HUNG UP ON THIS NOTION

941
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,917
THAT WE HAVE SOME OBLIGATION

942
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,981
TO HELP THIS STRUGGLING
BLACK MAN, YOU KNOW?

943
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,277
CUT HIM SOME SLACK
UNTIL HE CAN OVERCOME

944
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:16,690
THESE HISTORICAL INJUSTICES.

945
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,165
IT'S CRAP. THIS STUFF
JUST PERPETUATES IT...

946
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,761
ALL THIS LIBERAL
NONSENSE, YOU KNOW?

947
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,246
EVERYONE'S TURNING AND
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY

948
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,270
WHILE OUR COUNTRY
ROTS FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

949
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,050
I MEAN, CHRIST, LINCOLN
FREED THE SLAVES,

950
00:45:26,074 --> 00:45:28,174
WHAT, LIKE, 130 YEARS AGO.

951
00:45:28,243 --> 00:45:30,403
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER?

952
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:34,080
JEWS HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED
FOR OVER 5,000 YEARS.

953
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,515
ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S
WRONG TO FEEL SENSITIVE

954
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:37,850
ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM?

955
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,218
Stacey: OH, FORGET THAT.

956
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:42,321
I'M WITH YOU. I'M WITH
YOU ALL THE WAY, BABY.

957
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,168
I'M SO SICK OF THESE
LIBERAL HYPOCRITES.

958
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:46,352
OH, HERE WE GO
AGAIN. I LOVE THIS PART.

959
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:47,394
THIS IS GREAT.

960
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,406
LOOK AT THE WAY THEY
SCAPEGOATED CHIEF GATES.

961
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,875
YOU TELL ME THEY WOULD'VE
COME DOWN THAT HARD

962
00:45:50,899 --> 00:45:52,059
ON BLACK WILLIE WILLIAMS.

963
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,316
NO WAY, BECAUSE THAT
VIDEOTAPE WAS A SET-UP

964
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:55,584
TO GET RID OF GATES.

965
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:56,585
YES.

966
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,865
NO. NO, YOU CANNOT.
DON'T INTERRUPT.

967
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,190
EXCUSE ME. I WAS
TALKING. I LISTENED TO YOU.

968
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,903
WHO DO YOU DON'T THINK
YOU ARE? INTERRUPT.

969
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,304
SHE'S RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF MAKING A POINT.

970
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,422
WHO THE HELL DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE?

971
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,224
HEY! DAVINA, SIT DOWN.

972
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:09,532
SIT DOWN! BE QUIET! SHUT UP!

973
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,533
SIT DOWN! NO!

974
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,779
DEREK, SHUT UP! CALM DOWN.

975
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,869
DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP!

976
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,048
SIT YOUR ASS DOWN.

977
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,117
NO. SIT DOWN. SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

978
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,073
MOVE! NO!

979
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,441
GOD DAMN IT, DEREK! MOVE!

980
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,789
SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND
GIVE MY GIRLFRIEND RESPECT.

981
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,180
DEREK, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO PROVE?

982
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,910
MURRAY, STAY OUT
OF IT! COME HERE!

983
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:28,050
HEY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

984
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,501
Murray: DEREK, LET HER GO!

985
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:30,919
DEREK, LET HER GO!

986
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,456
YOU NEED TO LEARN SOME
FUCKING MANNERS, DAVINA!

987
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,075
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

988
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:37,543
SHUT UP!

989
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:39,211
Doris: STOP!

990
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,345
SHE CAN'T BREATHE!

991
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:42,397
Derek: UHH!

992
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,493
LET HER GO!

993
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:45,634
YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE?

994
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,553
ARE YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE?

995
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,305
YOU'RE ARE YOU? AN ASSHOLE.

996
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,834
AAH! I HATE YOU!

997
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:02,947
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
DEREK? THIS IS YOUR FAMILY.

998
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,214
RIGHT.<i> MY</i> FAMILY. <i>MY</i> FAMILY,

999
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,171
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

1000
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,572
I DON'T GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT YOU

1001
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,290
OR ANYBODY ELSE
OR WHAT YOU THINK.

1002
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,170
YOU'RE NOT A PART OF
IT, AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

1003
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,405
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

1004
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:12,561
OH, IT DOESN'T?

1005
00:47:12,614 --> 00:47:14,458
YOU DON'T THINK I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE?

1006
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:15,759
YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO SIT HERE AND SMILE

1007
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:19,101
WHILE SOME FUCKING KIKE
TRIES TO FUCK MY MOTHER?

1008
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,180
IT'S NEVER GOING
TO HAPPEN, MURRAY.

1009
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,237
FUCKING FORGET IT.

1010
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,405
NOT ON MY WATCH. NOT
WHILE I'M IN THIS FAMILY.

1011
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,507
I WILL FUCKING CUT
YOUR SHYLOCK NOSE OFF

1012
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:26,609
AND STICK IT UP YOUR ASS

1013
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,277
BEFORE I LET THAT HAPPEN,

1014
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,812
COMING IN HERE AND
POISONING MY FAMILY'S DINNER

1015
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,948
WITH YOUR JEWISH, NIGGER-LOVING,

1016
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,016
HIPPIE BULLSHIT.

1017
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,588
FUCK YOU.

1018
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:40,589
FUCK YOU!

1019
00:47:40,642 --> 00:47:42,742
YEAH, WALK OUT.

1020
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,977
ASSHOLE. FUCKING
CABALA-READING MOTHERFUCKER.

1021
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:46,445
GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE.

1022
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:53,653
YOU SEE THIS? THAT
MEANS NOT WELCOME.

1023
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:07,366
WHAT DID I DO?

1024
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:08,667
YOU DISGUST ME, YOU KNOW THAT?

1025
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,569
YOU DISGUST ME...
BRING HIM TO OUR TABLE

1026
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,271
AND CRIMPING YOUR
HAIR AND YOUR DRESS...

1027
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,523
DON'T WHAT DID I DO? TOUCH ME.

1028
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,508
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

1029
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:17,888
HOW COULD YOU BRING
HIM TO MY FATHER'S TABLE?

1030
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:20,279
HOW COULD YOU GO
FROM DAD TO THAT?

1031
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:21,480
AREN'T YOU ASHAMED?

1032
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:24,816
I'M ASHAMED THAT YOU
CAME OUT OF MY BODY!

1033
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,372
GO RUN TO YOUR FUCKING KIKE!

1034
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,506
GO RUN TO HIM!

1035
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:38,647
IT'S OK.

1036
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,555
I'M PROUD OF YOU, BABY.

1037
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:48,840
I'M SO SORRY, DORIS.

1038
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:50,525
I REALLY AM.

1039
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,068
HE'S GONE.

1040
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:02,754
HE'S JUST A BOY

1041
00:49:02,823 --> 00:49:04,823
WITHOUT A FATHER.

1042
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,541
DORIS,

1043
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,690
YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORLD
YOUR CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN.

1044
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,940
GOOD-BYE.

1045
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,085
HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

1046
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,590
TAKE THIS, YOU FUCKING DICK!

1047
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:12,852
AAH! NO, NO, NO. COME HERE.

1048
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:13,808
FUCK YOU!

1049
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:14,809
DAVINA, CALM DOWN.

1050
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:15,810
LET GO OF ME! CALM DOWN.

1051
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,141
LET ME GO, GOD DAMN IT!

1052
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:18,275
SORRY. FUCK YOU!

1053
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:19,299
I'M SORRY.

1054
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,285
I WOULD NEVER HURT
YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.

1055
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,320
COME ON. I SCREWED
UP. I LOST CONTROL.

1056
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,955
IT'S NOT YOU.

1057
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,424
I'M SORRY.

1058
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,159
COME ON. I'D NEVER
HURT YOU GUYS.

1059
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,438
I'D NEVER HURT
YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.

1060
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,128
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

1061
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,477
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

1062
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:36,789
I TRUST YOU, DEREK.

1063
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:46,907
HI.

1064
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,761
HI. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT OF BED, HUH?

1065
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:50,963
YOU WANT A PLANE RIDE?

1066
00:50:51,032 --> 00:50:52,331
YEAH.

1067
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:54,266
GOING FOR TAKEOFF.

1068
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:58,037
WHOO-HOO! WHOO!

1069
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:00,206
Danny: OH, NO.

1070
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:01,274
OH, NO, NO. CRASH.

1071
00:51:01,342 --> 00:51:02,875
WHOO-HOO!

1072
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:04,009
BETTER GO TO MOM.

1073
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:06,645
OOH, SHE'S A CRAZY FLIER.

1074
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:08,113
KISS MOM.

1075
00:51:08,182 --> 00:51:09,581
OH, YEAH.

1076
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:13,485
OK.

1077
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:20,103
OH, YOU DON'T FEEL TOO HOT.

1078
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,161
NO. IT'S MY CHEST.

1079
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,162
SO, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

1080
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:24,163
I'M JUST THINKING.

1081
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:25,431
YEAH.

1082
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,710
THERE'S A LOT OF
THAT GOING AROUND.

1083
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:28,567
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
WE GOT HERE SOMETIMES.

1084
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:29,568
MOM...

1085
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:30,969
I FEEL LIKE I LET YOU ALL DOWN,

1086
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,416
ONLY I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED.

1087
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,422
MOM, IT'S OK.

1088
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,191
YEAH? YEAH.

1089
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:40,107
IT'S COLD IN HERE. NO
WONDER YOU'RE SICK.

1090
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:41,341
NO. YOU DON'T GET
SICK FROM THE COLD.

1091
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,764
YOU GET SICK FROM GERMS.

1092
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,467
NO. YOU GET SICK FROM SMOKING.

1093
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:50,155
YOU OUGHT TO QUIT.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

1094
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,074
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT FOR?

1095
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:00,715
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LET
THAT BEAUTIFUL HAIR GROW BACK?

1096
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,553
THE DAY YOU QUIT SMOKING.

1097
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,241
DEAL.

1098
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,043
I'D BETTER GET ALLY TO BED.

1099
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:13,044
YOU SAY GOOD NIGHT TO MOM?

1100
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,045
MM-HMM.

1101
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:15,046
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO BED.

1102
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:16,214
COME ON.

1103
00:52:16,284 --> 00:52:17,215
GOOD NIGHT, MAMA.

1104
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:18,651
GOOD NIGHT, BABY.

1105
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:21,851
Danny: ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, MAMA.

1106
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,631
Danny: I GO BACK TO THAT NIGHT

1107
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,655
AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MY MIND.

1108
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,007
I TRY TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.

1109
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:00,971
I WANT YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

1110
00:53:00,995 --> 00:53:02,794
THAT'S FINE. I'LL BE
GONE IN THE MORNING.

1111
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:06,778
Stacey: HE CAN MOVE IN WITH ME.

1112
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:09,245
Danny: IN MY MIND, I IMAGINE
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED

1113
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,103
IF I HADN'T GONE TO THAT ROOM

1114
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,554
AND TOLD HIM.

1115
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:15,168
GET DOWN!

1116
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:17,842
NO, DEREK!

1117
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:21,813
HELP, MOMMY!

1118
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:34,764
AAH!

1119
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:37,863
NIGGER, YOU JUST FUCKED
WITH THE WRONG BULL.

1120
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:39,197
COME HERE!

1121
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:40,377
DAMN! AAH!

1122
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:41,478
YOU SHOULD'VE LEARNED YOUR PLACE

1123
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:43,819
ON THE FUCKING BASKETBALL COURT,

1124
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,598
BUT YOU FUCKING MONKEYS
NEVER GET THE MESSAGE!

1125
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,189
UHH!

1126
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,591
MY FATHER GAVE ME THAT
TRUCK, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

1127
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,026
YOU EVER SHOOT AT FIREMEN?

1128
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:53,278
YOU COME HERE, YOU
SHOOT AT MY FAMILY?

1129
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:55,714
I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU A REAL
LESSON NOW, MOTHERFUCKER.

1130
00:53:55,783 --> 00:53:57,983
PUT YOUR FUCKING
MOUTH ON THE CURB.

1131
00:53:58,052 --> 00:53:58,984
HOLD ON, MAN.

1132
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:01,853
PUT IT ON THE CURB RIGHT NOW!

1133
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:06,358
Derek: THAT'S IT.

1134
00:54:06,427 --> 00:54:08,126
DEREK, NO!

1135
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:09,794
AAH!

1136
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:12,564
NO!

1137
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:14,166
NOW SAY GOOD NIGHT.

1138
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:15,818
AAH!

1139
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,064
FUCKER.

1140
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,315
DROP YOUR WEAPON!

1141
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,673
PUT YOUR WEAPON ON THE GROUND!

1142
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,675
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

1143
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,555
I SAID GET YOUR HANDS UP!

1144
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,111
NOW TURN AROUND!

1145
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:54,739
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

1146
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:00,512
GET DOWN ON YOUR
KNEES RIGHT NOW!

1147
00:55:58,305 --> 00:56:00,606
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1148
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:02,040
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1149
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,111
LET'S GO.

1150
00:56:07,214 --> 00:56:08,413
COME ON.

1151
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:09,915
NO.

1152
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,057
WHAT, SHE AIN'T
GONNA OPEN THE DOOR?

1153
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,693
SOMEONE RIGHT FUCKING

1154
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:23,261
DANNY, IT'S FOR YOU.

1155
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,114
BE RIGHT THERE.

1156
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:39,368
WACKA! HA HA!

1157
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,397
OPEN THE DOOR, DANNY.
IT'S FUCKING FREEZING!

1158
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,433
DANNY, I'M GONNA BE SICK!

1159
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:47,435
WAAH! COME ON, DANNY!

1160
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,124
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME BEERS.

1161
00:57:32,566 --> 00:57:34,686
HEY, WHAT A PARTY, HUH, FATSO?

1162
00:57:34,735 --> 00:57:38,503
I'M NOT FAT, ASSHOLE! I'M HUSKY!

1163
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:40,588
WHAT THE FUCK'S UP, SETH?

1164
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,891
DRINK UP, DANNY, BEFORE
YOUR BROTHER SEES YOU.

1165
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,170
HOLY FUCK, HE'S HERE!

1166
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,412
YEAH, HE'S FUCKING HERE.

00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:48,721
FUCK YOU, SETH!

1168
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,518
LET'S GO TALK TO CAMERON, DANNY.

1169
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:54,587
FATHER VINYARD?

1170
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,538
HOW'S IT GOING? I'M
JASON, THIS IS CHRIS.

1171
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,206
WE'RE FRIENDS WITH YOUR BROTHER.

1172
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,942
YOU ARE A FUCKING GOD, MAN!

1173
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,477
Stacey: DEREK!

1174
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,384
AAH! HEY.

1175
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:21,057
I THOUGHT YOU
TURNED THAT PAPER IN.

1176
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,865
I DID. NOW FUCKING
MURRAY TURNED ME IN,

1177
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:27,085
SO SWEENEY'S MAKING
ME WRITE ANOTHER ONE.

1178
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:28,653
HMM.

1179
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:31,990
GOOD OLD SWEENEY.
HE NEVER STOPS TRYING.

1180
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:35,009
HE'S ONE OF THOSE "PROUD
TO BE NIGGER" PEOPLE.

1181
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,445
I HATE THOSE GUYS.

1182
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,681
WAIT A MINUTE,
DANNY. HE'S NOT PROUD.

1183
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,399
NO.

1184
00:58:41,468 --> 00:58:45,169
HE'S A MANIPULATIVE,
SELF-RIGHTEOUS UNCLE TOM.

1185
00:58:45,238 --> 00:58:47,216
HE'S TRYING TO
MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY

1186
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,451
ABOUT WRITING
ABOUT ADOLF HITLER.

1187
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:50,408
YEAH. SOME NIGGER,

1188
00:58:50,477 --> 00:58:53,611
SOME SPIC WRITES
ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING

1189
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,613
OR FUCKING CESAR COMMIE CHAVEZ

1190
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:58,149
GETS A PAT ON THE HEAD.

1191
00:58:58,218 --> 00:59:00,318
YEAH.

1192
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:04,155
YOU CAN SEE THE
HYPOCRISY IN THAT, CAN'T YOU?

1193
00:59:04,224 --> 00:59:05,224
DEFINITELY.

1194
00:59:09,663 --> 00:59:11,195
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1195
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:14,065
NO. LISTEN, LISTEN. WAIT.

1196
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,067
I WANT TO SEE YOU, OK?

1197
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,036
I DO, BUT I GOTTA TAKE
CARE OF SOMETHING TONIGHT.

1198
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:22,607
OK.

1199
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:23,676
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1200
00:59:23,744 --> 00:59:25,176
YEAH. I'M HERE.

1201
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:27,285
WHEN YOU'RE READY, I'M HERE.

1202
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:32,384
WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING WITH ME?

1203
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,452
ANYTHING.

1204
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,453
LEAVE WITH ME.

1205
00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:38,039
LEAVE WHERE?

1206
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,608
LEAVE HERE. LEAVE ALL THIS.

1207
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,977
JUST COME WITH ME.

1208
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,979
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

1209
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,725
THEY WORSHIP YOU.
YOU'RE LIKE A GOD TO THEM.

1210
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,593
IF YOU THINK WE
HAD IT GOOD BEFORE,

1211
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,229
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE NOW.

1212
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,685
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT ALL THAT.

1213
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,821
I DON'T WANT IT. I DON'T
WANT MY FAMILY INVOLVED.

1214
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,407
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HERE
FUCKED IT ALL UP, UNDERSTAND?

1215
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:57,475
YOU THINK WHAT
YOU DID WAS WRONG?

1216
00:59:57,544 --> 01:00:00,379
OH, BABY. OH, COME ON.

1217
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,947
THOSE NIGGERS GOT
EXACTLY WHAT THEY DESERVED,

1218
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,350
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT.

1219
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:06,963
I UNDERSTAND YOU JUST GOT OUT,

1220
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:09,488
BUT NO ONE'S GONNA HURT
YOU. NO ONE CAN TOUCH YOU.

1221
01:00:09,556 --> 01:00:10,989
THERE'S A SMALL ARMY.

1222
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:13,625
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET A
BUNCH OF SPOOKS KICK US OUT.

1223
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,004
STACEY, YOU'RE
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

1224
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,229
I'M NOT SCARED. I
DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE.

1225
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:21,900
I'M DONE WITH IT. I'M
THROUGH WITH THIS.

1226
01:00:21,968 --> 01:00:26,805
IT'S... IT'S BULLSHIT, STACEY.

1227
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,941
YOU DON'T NEED THIS,
STACEY. COME ON, TRUST ME.

1228
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:33,745
IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME,
JUST TRUST ME. COME WITH ME.

1229
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:35,046
COME ON.

1230
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:37,048
YOU'RE NUTS. YOU ARE NUTS.

1231
01:00:37,117 --> 01:00:38,517
NO WAY.

1232
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:41,620
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE.

1233
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,889
WE ARE 10 TIMES WHAT WE WERE,

1234
01:00:43,957 --> 01:00:45,518
AND WE ARE BLOODY ORGANIZED.

1235
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,076
IT IS LIKE NOTHING
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.

1236
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,944
THIS WAS A MISTAKE. FORGET IT.

1237
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,380
WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT WAS A MISTAKE?

1238
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,649
STACEY, JUST SAY GOOD-BYE.

1239
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,618
THIS ISN'T YOU. I KNOW YOU.

1240
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,927
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, STACEY.

1241
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,730
HEY, ARE YOU DANNY'S BROTHER?

1242
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:09,798
YEAH.

1243
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,817
WILL YOU TELL HIM
LIZZY'S LOOKING FOR HIM?

1244
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:14,719
THANK YOU.

1245
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,434
WE'LL LET THE NIGGERS,
KIKES, AND SPICS

1246
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,391
GRAB FOR THEIR PIECE OF THE PIE.

1247
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,626
CAN'T BLAME 'EM.

1248
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:25,079
COURSE, THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIGHT TO GET IT.

1249
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,784
AND IF WE SCARE THE
FUCK OUT OF PEOPLE,

1250
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,587
AND A FEW PEOPLE GET
KILLED IN THE PROCESS,

1251
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:33,821
SO BE IT.

1252
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,508
Derek: GONNA PUT THAT
IN YOUR PAPER, DANNY?

1253
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:39,244
HEY, MAN.

1254
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:41,579
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

1255
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,665
THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIER.

1256
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,684
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, DANNY?

1257
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:48,820
COME ON, MAN. I
HAD TO CHECK IT OUT.

1258
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:50,138
YOU KNEW I WAS GONNA COME.

1259
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,067
LET THE KID ALONE, DEREK.

1260
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,411
HE KNOWS WHEN TO GO TO BED.

1261
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:57,312
GO WAIT OUTSIDE.

1262
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,597
COME ON, DER. I'M
NOT DOING ANYTHING.

1263
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:03,601
THIS LITTLE BLONDE GIRL
KEEPS ASKING FOR YOU.

1264
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,902
SHE'S DYING. COME ON.

1265
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,371
WELL, I GOTTA CHECK OUT.

1266
01:02:06,439 --> 01:02:07,372
GO EASY ON HER.

1267
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,307
ALL RIGHT.

1268
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,779
WAIT FOR ME RIGHT OUTSIDE.

1269
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:21,886
TAKE IT EASY.

1270
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:24,355
CHILL OUT.

1271
01:02:24,424 --> 01:02:26,791
YOU'RE ON SAFE GROUND.

1272
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:29,460
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH
YOUR ASS AROUND HERE.

1273
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,964
COME ON. SIT DOWN. RELAX.

1274
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:37,835
I'M SORRY. THE PARTY
WAS A LITTLE QUICK,

1275
01:02:37,904 --> 01:02:41,105
BUT WE'RE JUST SO DAMN
GLAD YOU'RE BACK, DEREK.

1276
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,207
IT'S ONLY NATURAL YOU
SHOULD FEEL A LITTLE FUNNY.

1277
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:44,709
I DON'T FEEL FUNNY, CAM.

1278
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:47,511
YOU KNOW, YOU MADE THE
FAT KID A LITTLE NERVOUS.

1279
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:49,480
HE THINKS THE JOINT
MESSED WITH YOUR MIND.

1280
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:50,915
IT DID.

1281
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:02,227
♪♪ GLORY, GLORY, HALLELUJAH ♪♪

1282
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:06,947
♪♪ GLORY, GLORY, HALLELUJAH ♪♪

1283
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,301
♪♪ THE WHITE MAN MARCHES ON ♪♪

1284
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,504
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

1285
01:03:13,574 --> 01:03:15,756
YOU TALK ABOUT ORGANIZATION?

1286
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,693
WAIT'LL YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE
DONE WITH THE INTERNET.

1287
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,739
WE'VE GOT EVERY GANG
FROM SEATTLE TO SAN DIEGO

1288
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,330
WORKING TOGETHER NOW.

1289
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,866
NOT COMPETING ANYMORE.
THEY'RE CONSOLIDATED.

1290
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:27,302
ONLY THING WE LACK IS A
LITTLE OVERALL LEADERSHIP.

1291
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,488
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

1292
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,591
THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE
GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.

1293
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,876
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
COME TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

1294
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,580
WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THAT.

1295
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,348
I'M DONE WITH IT, CAM.

1296
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,351
YEAH, WELL, I KNOW
YOU GREW OUT OF

1297
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:46,905
THAT SHAVED HEAD BULLSHIT
A LONG TIME AGO, THANK GOD.

1298
01:03:46,974 --> 01:03:48,718
I LIKE YOUR HAIR
THE WAY IT IS NOW.

1299
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,759
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WE'RE THINKING BIGGER NOW.

1300
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,572
NO MORE OF THIS
FUCKING GROCERY STORE...

1301
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,463
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME. I AM DONE WITH IT.

1302
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,732
ALL THAT BULLSHIT OUT THERE
AND ALL YOUR BULLSHIT, TOO.

1303
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,467
I'M OUT.

1304
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,636
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
YOU'VE JUST DONE HARD TIME.

1305
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,805
DON'T YOU FUCKING TALK
TO ME ABOUT HARD TIME.

1306
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,018
YOU DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT.

1307
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:06,992
I'VE DONE MINE.

1308
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,427
YOU DIDN'T DO SHIT. I
FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU.

1309
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:10,929
YOU DID 2 MONTHS,

1310
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:13,397
THEN ROLLED OVER ON 2 KIDS
AND LET THEM GO DOWN FOR YOU.

1311
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:15,333
SO DON'T FEED ME YOUR
FUCKING LIES, CAMERON.

1312
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:19,182
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS STUPID.

1313
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:20,655
I'M DONE.

1314
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:23,358
YOU GO COOL OFF. GET
LAID. DO SOMETHING.

1315
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,227
GET YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT,
AND THEN I'LL TALK TO YOU.

1316
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,407
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF I DON'T, DOES IT?

1317
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,365
'CAUSE YOU GOT THE NEXT CROP

1318
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,245
LINED UP AND READY TO GO,
YOU FUCKING CHICKEN HAWK.

1319
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:34,101
EXCUSE ME?

1320
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,771
YOU PREY ON PEOPLE,
CAM! YOU USE THEM!

1321
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,907
I LOST 3 YEARS FOR YOUR
PHONY FUCKING CAUSE,

1322
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,754
BUT I AM ON TO YOU
NOW, YOU FUCKING SNAKE.

1323
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:44,412
HEY, DEREK, WATCH
IT. BE CAREFUL.

1324
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:45,913
REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE.

1325
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,915
THIS IS NOT SOME
FUCKING COUNTRY CLUB

1326
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,584
WHERE YOU CAN WALTZ
IN AND OUT OF HERE...

1327
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,386
SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!

1328
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:54,322
I CAME IN HERE TO TELL
YOU ONE THING. I AM OUT.

1329
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,257
OUT! AND DANNY IS OUT, TOO!

1330
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,604
IF YOU COME NEAR MY
FAMILY, I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU.

1331
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,046
WELL, EXCUSE ME,
BUT FUCK YOU, DEREK.

1332
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:03,381
YOU CAN'T COME
BARKING THREATS AT ME.

1333
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:06,284
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU
WANT, BUT DANNY IS A GOOD KID.

1334
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:08,687
HE'S NOT SOME
WHINY PUSSY LIKE YOU.

1335
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:10,700
HE NEEDS MY HELP, AND
I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO HIM.

1336
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:13,158
IF YOU COME NEAR DANNY AGAIN,

1337
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:15,437
I WILL FEED YOU YOUR
FUCKING HEART, CAMERON.

1338
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:18,029
I WON'T HAVE TO.

1339
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:21,265
HE'LL COME TO ME.

1340
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,484
I'M MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM
NOW THAN YOU'LL EVER BE.

1341
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:24,553
UNH!

1342
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:28,973
SHIT.

1343
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:31,909
YOU'RE A FUCKING
DEAD MAN, VINYARD.

1344
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,444
HEY, HEY, HEY. WHERE'S CAMERON?

1345
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:50,811
WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?

1346
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,497
HEY, DEREK.

1347
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:53,498
HEY, DEREK!

1348
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:55,666
STAY AWAY FROM ME. DANNY!

1349
01:05:55,735 --> 01:05:57,668
WHY DON'T YOU SHARE
WITH THE REST OF US

1350
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:01,272
WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME,
YOU PIECE OF SHIT NIGGER!

1351
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,508
YOU MONKEY-FUCKING
DANNY! TRAITOR!

1352
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:05,309
YOU A FUCKING NIGGER-FUCKER?

1353
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,311
HEY, DANNY! COME ON!

1354
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,847
HE'S A FUCKING
NIGGER! NIGGER! NIGGER!

1355
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:12,817
CAM'S OUT COLD! WHERE

1356
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,852
Skinhead: GUN! HE'S GOT A GUN!

1357
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:17,204
SHIT! BACK UP!

1358
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,756
Danny: SETH!

1359
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:20,736
YOU MAKE ME FUCKING SICK!

1360
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,594
SETH! PUT DOWN THE FUCKING GUN!

1361
01:06:23,663 --> 01:06:24,829
Man: SHOOT THE NIGGER!

1362
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:28,699
SHOOT HIM! DO IT, SETH! DO IT!

1363
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:29,967
Woman: TRAITOR!

1364
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:30,968
SETH!

1365
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:33,357
DO IT, SETH! DO IT!

1366
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,520
AAH!

1367
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,258
BACK UP! MOVE!

1368
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,712
BACK UP! BACK THE FUCK UP!

1369
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,182
MOVE! MOVE!

1370
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,416
Man: EASY, DEREK! HEY!

01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:10,319
FUCK YOU! WHO DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE?!

1373
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:11,742
DANNY, RELAX.

1374
01:07:11,812 --> 01:07:13,355
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

1375
01:07:13,379 --> 01:07:15,646
TAKE IT EASY, DAN. TAKE IT EASY.

1376
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:17,748
I FUCKING HATE YOU, DER!

1377
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:19,818
ALL RIGHT, SHH, SHH. I MEAN IT.

1378
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,319
HUH?

1379
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:23,938
COME ON. SHUT UP. TAKE IT EASY.

1380
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,968
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU, DER?

1381
01:07:25,992 --> 01:07:28,359
TAKE IT EASY. TAKE IT EASY.

1382
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:30,628
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU, DER?

1383
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:41,405
COME ON. COME ON.

1384
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,872
Danny: IT'S JUST SO FUCKED.

1385
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,830
I'M SORRY. YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT.

1386
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,098
I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME.

1387
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,768
FUCK YOU, MAN.

1388
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,370
THAT WAS SO FUCKED UP.

1389
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,005
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1390
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,642
GOD, IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN THAT WAY.

1391
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,644
THAT WAS FUCKED UP.

1392
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,011
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

1393
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,815
THAT'S NOT WHAT I PLANNED.
IT JUST ALL WENT TO SHIT.

1394
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:11,386
JUST SHIT. GOT TOTALLY
OUT OF CONTROL.

1395
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,757
WHAT'S FUCKING HAPPENING HERE?

1396
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,696
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

1397
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:27,680
I CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT, DAN.

1398
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:29,970
CAN'T GO BACK TO WHAT?

1399
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,606
TO ANY OF IT.

1400
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:34,609
THOSE GUYS, THE GANG,
THAT LIFE... I'M DONE WITH IT.

1401
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,248
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU UP THERE?

1402
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:50,324
Guard: FEED LINE.
BACK UP FOR CHOW.

1403
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:52,243
DON'T BE LATE,
YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

1404
01:08:52,312 --> 01:08:54,112
LET'S GO IF YOU WANT TO EAT!

1405
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,281
GET UP! 5 MINUTES!

1406
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:58,616
THIS IS MY FUCKING
HOUSE! GET UP!

1407
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:01,035
WHAT THE FUCK'S YOUR
PROBLEM, YOU ASSHOLES?

1408
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,770
MOVE!

1409
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,300
LET'S GO! OPEN
THE FUCKING GATES!

1410
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,557
ALL RIGHT, RACK 'EM!

1411
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,447
5 MINUTES! STEP FORWARD!

1412
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,749
THOSE BEDS BETTER BE MADE.

1413
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,898
Derek: AFTER 2
DAYS IN THAT PLACE,

1414
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,417
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS
GONNA MAKE IT A WEEK.

1415
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:23,507
Guard: COME ON,
YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!

1416
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,893
YOU WANT TO EAT TODAY,
YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT?

1417
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,895
HEY, YOU WHITE
TRASH PIECE OF SHIT!

1418
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,408
YOU THINK YOU'RE FUCKING
SPECIAL, WHITEFISH?

1419
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:33,067
BUTTON THAT TOP
BUTTON! LET'S GO! MOVE!

1420
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:36,337
ARE YOU EYEBALLING ME?
DON'T EYEBALL-FUCK ME, ASSHOLE!

1421
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,923
I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!

1422
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:41,826
I'M GONNA KEEP MY EYE ON
YOU, YOU WHITE PIECE OF SHIT!

1423
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,730
DON'T FUCKING EYEBALL ME,
BOY! I'LL FUCKING SKULL-FUCK YOU!

1424
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,632
STEP FORWARD!

1425
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,102
TURN TO THE LEFT.

1426
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:56,624
STEP FORWARD TO CHOW! LET'S GO!

1427
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,126
COME ON! HEY, FISH,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1428
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,495
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
FUCKER! LET'S GO!

1429
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,665
Derek: ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE
KNEW WHO I WAS ANYWAY,

1430
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,735
SO I FIGURED I'D PUT UP A
FLAG AND HOPE A FRIEND SEES IT.

1431
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,167
THAT'S THE CAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE.

1432
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,422
BOSS. HEY.

1433
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,023
HAVE A SEAT.

1434
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,024
HEY.

1435
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:38,373
IT'S A PLEASURE.

1436
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:40,762
HEY.

1437
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,671
DON'T FUCK WITH ME, ALL RIGHT?

1438
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,040
'CAUSE I'M THE MOST
DANGEROUS MAN IN THIS PRISON.

1439
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,108
YOU KNOW WHY?

1440
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,944
'CAUSE I CONTROL THE UNDERWEAR.

1441
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,822
WE PICK 'EM UP OVER HERE,
AND WE STORE 'EM OVER THERE.

1442
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,807
AND I HOPE YOU
WORK OUT, ALL RIGHT?

1443
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:12,877
'CAUSE THE LAST GUY THEY SENT
ME DIDN'T WEAR NO DRAWERS,

1444
01:12:12,946 --> 01:12:15,045
COULDN'T READ THE
SIZES IN THE DRAWERS,

1445
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:17,281
AND USED TO SNIFF THE
DRAWERS, ALL RIGHT?

1446
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,734
WE GOT 2 SIZES... MEDIUM
AND LARGE, ALL RIGHT?

1447
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:22,236
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS PUT THE
MEDIUMS WITH THE MEDIUMS

1448
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,949
AND THE LARGES WITH
THE LARGES, ALL RIGHT?

1449
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:25,890
I KNOW IT'S A BORING JOB,

1450
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:28,170
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THAT
LAST SHIT THEY HAD ME DOING.

1451
01:12:28,194 --> 01:12:30,160
I SPENT 2 YEARS IN THE KITCHEN

1452
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:32,107
SCRUBBIN' HOT-ASS POTS AND PANS.

1453
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:34,999
THAT YOU DON'T
WANNA DO, ALL RIGHT?

1454
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:37,079
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY AS
SHIT YOU LANDED THIS JOB.

1455
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,581
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT THEY'D HAVE YOU DO

1456
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:39,837
UP IN THE JOINT.

1457
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:44,976
BY THE WAY, UH...

1458
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:46,544
WHAT YOU IN FOR?

1459
01:12:49,716 --> 01:12:51,716
PROBABLY ROBBED
SOME OLD LADY, HUH?

1460
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,396
OK, I KNOW YOUR KIND, RIGHT?

1461
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,698
BAD-ASS PECKERWOOD
WITH AN ATTITUDE.

1462
01:13:09,435 --> 01:13:11,536
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAN,

1463
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:13,571
YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR ASS,

1464
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,374
'CAUSE IN THE JOINT,
YOU THE NIGGER, NOT ME.

1465
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:25,065
Derek: I WAS A YEAR IN. I
THOUGHT I WAS CRUISING.

1466
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,735
THEN EVERYTHING STARTED
GETTING COMPLICATED.

1467
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,984
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

1468
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,194
Derek: WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

1469
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:02,803
THAT'S JUST POLITICS,
MAN. FAVORS, YOU KNOW?

1470
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:07,307
HE'S DOING FAVORS
FOR THAT FUCKING SPIC?

1471
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,945
MITCH HAS JUST GOT A
LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA

1472
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,313
ON THE SIDE WITH
THEM BOYS, YOU KNOW?

1473
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,583
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

1474
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,735
NO.

1475
01:14:17,803 --> 01:14:19,720
THAT'S BULLSHIT, MAN.

1476
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,467
SOMEBODY SHOULD
SAY SOMETHING TO HIM.

1477
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,134
WHAT THE FUCK IS HE THINKING?

1478
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,993
MITCH IS THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE NOT A CORPSE RIGHT NOW.

1479
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,445
YOU KNOW WHAT? I
DON'T FUCKING GIVE A SHIT.

1480
01:14:28,514 --> 01:14:30,681
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

1481
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,150
HE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.

1482
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,697
I'M GETTING SICK OF IT, MAN.

1483
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:37,321
THERE'S A LOT OF HARD TALK
HERE AND NO FOLLOW-THROUGH.

1484
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,995
I THINK YOU BETTER CHILL OUT
ON THE PREACHING BULLSHIT.

1485
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,463
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE TIRED
OF THAT SHIT AROUND HERE.

1486
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:49,934
EASE UP ON IT.

1487
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,100
YO.

1488
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,376
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, DORIS?

1489
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,534
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1490
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,337
LOOK, I TOLD YOU I DON'T
WANT YOU ALL COMING UP HERE.

1491
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:29,540
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU TOLD ME, OK?

1492
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:30,774
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU NOW.

1493
01:15:51,497 --> 01:15:52,996
SO, HOW IS EVERYONE?

1494
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:57,468
DAVINA'S GREAT. SHE'S
GETTING STRAIGHT As ALMOST.

1495
01:15:57,537 --> 01:16:02,873
AND, UH, ALLY'S WALKING,
STARTING TO TALK A LITTLE.

1496
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:09,079
HOW'S DANNY?

1497
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,082
DANNY?

1498
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,885
DANNY...

1499
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:17,721
HE HOLDS YOU UP SO HIGH.

1500
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:21,058
HE THINKS YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

1501
01:16:21,126 --> 01:16:24,728
HE'S ALWAYS BRAGGING
ABOUT YOU TO CAMERON...

1502
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:26,096
AND ALL HIS NEW FRIENDS.

1503
01:16:29,802 --> 01:16:31,569
HE'S STARTING TO
REMIND ME OF YOU.

1504
01:16:31,637 --> 01:16:34,572
JESUS, DON'T SOUND
SO WORRIED, ALL RIGHT?

1505
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,073
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

1506
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,642
HE'S 16 YEARS OLD, DORIS.

1507
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:40,489
HE'S NOT GONNA BE A
LITTLE ANGEL FOREVE.

1508
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,946
YOU THINK BECAUSE I
WATCHED MY FIRSTBORN

1509
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,660
FUCK UP HIS ENTIRE
LIFE THAT I CAN SIT HERE

1510
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:49,086
AND WATCH MY BABY FOLLOW
HIM DOWN THE SAME TOILET?

1511
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:50,865
I CAN'T FIX ALL THIS
SHIT FROM UP HERE.

1512
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:52,789
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

1513
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,791
ALL IT DOES IS MAKE ME FEEL BAD.

1514
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,205
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT HARDER.

1515
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:59,763
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE DOING TIME, DEREK?

1516
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:02,032
YOU THINK YOU'RE HERE ALL ALONE?

1517
01:17:02,101 --> 01:17:03,800
YOU THINK I'M NOT
IN HERE WITH YOU?

1518
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:17,898
FUCK, MAN.

1519
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:22,881
EVERY DAY I WATCH YOU
GO THROUGH THESE SHEETS

1520
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:25,025
LIKE YOU GONNA GET
TO THE END OF THEM.

1521
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,554
LOOK, NIGGER, WILL
YOU CHILL THE FUCK OUT?

1522
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:29,844
GODDAMN!

1523
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:32,090
NO MATTER HOW FAST
YOU GET THROUGH THEM,

1524
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,475
THEY GONNA KEEP BRINGING THEM IN

1525
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:34,659
AND BRINGING THEM IN.

1526
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,944
AND THROWING THEM
AROUND LIKE THAT

1527
01:17:35,968 --> 01:17:38,535
AIN'T GONNA DO A DAMN THING
BUT GIVE YOU A HEART ATTACK!

1528
01:17:38,604 --> 01:17:40,381
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S COOL WITH ME!

1529
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,706
BUT YOU GONNA GIVE ME A
GODDAMN HEART ATTACK, TOO!

1530
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:53,512
I KNOW, I'M JUST A DUMB,
STUPID NIGGER, RIGHT?

1531
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,102
WHAT DO I KNOW?

1532
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,855
I KNOW I AIN'T THE ONE

1533
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,836
GETTING MAD AT THEM
DAMN SHEETS, THOUGH.

1534
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,176
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1535
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:03,889
THE ONLY SHEETS I GET MAD AT...

1536
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:05,746
I'LL TELL YOU.

1537
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,917
ALL RIGHT, BOY, THIS
IS WHAT WE GONNA DO.

1538
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,863
WE GONNA HATE SOME NIGGERS.
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO TODAY.

1539
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,649
WE GONNA HATE SOME
GODDAMN NIGGERS.

1540
01:18:13,673 --> 01:18:15,183
THAT'S ALL WE GONNA DO IS
HATE SOME NIGGERS ALL DAY.

1541
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:16,852
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A NIGGER IS,

1542
01:18:16,876 --> 01:18:18,404
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE GONNA HATE THEM.

1543
01:18:18,428 --> 01:18:20,327
MY COUSIN DEREK IS
IN THE PEN RIGHT NOW

1544
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:21,829
WORKIN' NEXT TO A NIGGER,

1545
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:24,598
DRIVING HIM NIGGER CRAZY.

1546
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:43,850
SEE?

1547
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,119
THAT'S THE TICKET.

1548
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:47,421
NICE AND EASY.

1549
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:51,532
NOW WE CAN IGNORE
EACH OTHER IN PEACE.

1550
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:55,863
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

1551
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,364
YOU KNOW WHAT HE TELLS ME?

1552
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,267
"IT'S BETTER THAN THE
PIG I JUST TRIED TO FUCK."

1553
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,422
HE NEVER LETS
ME FINISH THE JOKE.

1554
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,924
YOU FUCK HIM, TOO?

1555
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:10,835
WHATEVER. I GET BACK,
SHE'S LAYING ON HER BACK,

1556
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
HER LEGS ARE OPEN...

1557
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,299
WHAT'S UP?

1558
01:19:15,368 --> 01:19:16,800
HOW YOU DOING?

1559
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:18,135
THERE YOU GO.

1560
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:32,098
Derek: HE WAS TAKING
IT FROM THE MEXICANS

1561
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:34,234
AND DEALING IT OUT
TO HIS OWN PEOPLE.

1562
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,836
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN SHIT.

1563
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,204
NONE OF THEM DID.

1564
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:48,648
HEY!

1565
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,267
HEY, VINYARD!

1566
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,065
WHAT?

1567
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,200
COME ON, MAN.

1568
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,834
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

1569
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,470
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
SMELLS LIKE, RIGHT?

1570
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,939
DON'T TELL ME THIS SMELL
DON'T REMIND YOU OF A WOMAN.

1571
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,591
GOD, I MISS THAT SMELL, MAN.

1572
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:19,357
I MEAN, THE JOB I
HAD ON THE OUTSIDE

1573
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,259
WASN'T MUCH
BETTER THAN THIS ONE,

1574
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,428
BUT AT LEAST I GOT TO
GO HOME EVERY NIGHT

1575
01:20:23,452 --> 01:20:25,819
AND LIE DOWN NEXT TO
THAT SWEET SMELL, MAN.

1576
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,556
GOD, I MISS THAT.

1577
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:31,325
YOU GOT A WOMAN?

1578
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,377
YEAH, YOU GOT A WOMAN, MAN.

1579
01:20:34,446 --> 01:20:37,014
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME
ADVICE, ALL RIGHT?

1580
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,883
WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT YOU...

1581
01:20:39,952 --> 01:20:41,885
WHATEVER YOU DO, NO MATTER WHAT,

1582
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:43,949
DON'T LET HER LEAVE
HERE IN A FIGHT, MAN.

1583
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:45,951
DON'T LET HER WALK
OUT WITH A BAD ATTITUDE,

1584
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:47,174
'CAUSE IF YOU DO,

1585
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:48,575
YOU SPEND THE NEXT WEEK

1586
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:51,394
WONDER IF SHE'S GETTING HER
FUCK ON WITH SOMEBODY ELSE,

1587
01:20:51,463 --> 01:20:52,896
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1588
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:55,460
SO WHEN SHE COME TO SEE
YOU, IT'S NOTHING BUT SWEET TALK.

1589
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:58,151
SEND HER AWAY
FLOATING, ALL RIGHT?

1590
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,064
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE THE REAL WORLD

1591
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,455
WHERE YOU CAN FIGHT,

1592
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,201
BUT IT'S COOL TO FIGHT,
'CAUSE YOU CAN MAKE UP

1593
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,653
AND HAVE THAT MAKE-UP SEX.

1594
01:21:04,677 --> 01:21:06,554
KNOW WHAT I'M
SAYING? THAT<i> ANGRY</i> SEX.

1595
01:21:06,578 --> 01:21:08,278
THAT SEX WITH AN ATTITUDE.

1596
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:09,908
WHERE YOU JUST LAY ON YOUR BACK

1597
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,709
AND LET HER TAKE OUT ALL
THAT AGGRESSION ON YOU.

1598
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,333
ALL GUYS KNOW THAT, MAN.

1599
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:16,202
THAT'S THAT GOOD SEX.
THAT'S THAT POW, POW, POW.

1600
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:17,537
LET HER GET ON TOP,

1601
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,251
AND SHE'S GONNA
PUNISH YOU FIRST, RIGHT?

1602
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,874
"YOU BEEN A BAD BOY, HUH?

1603
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,743
"YOU BEEN A BAD BOY,
AND I'M GONNA PUNISH YOU.

1604
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,379
"I'M GONNA PUT IT ON YOU.

1605
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,881
DON'T YOU EVER... LET...
ME... CATCH... YOU..."

1606
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,850
"LOOKING AT... ANOTHER... WOMAN.

1607
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,219
"YEAH, YEAH.

1608
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:33,932
"I MAY FORGIVE
YOU IF YOU BRING IT.

1609
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,373
"I THINK I CAN...
I... I FORGIVE.

1610
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:38,161
"I FORGIVE. OH, RIGHT THERE.

1611
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,554
"RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE HITTING IT.

1612
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:41,498
"MY SPOT. THAT'S
IT. RIGHT. YEAH.

1613
01:21:41,547 --> 01:21:44,231
"YES, YES. I FOR...
I FORGIVE YOU.

1614
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,365
"I FORGIVE YOU.

1615
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:48,035
"I FOR... I FOR... I
FOR... I FORGIVE YOU!

1616
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,203
I LOVE YOU!"

1617
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,901
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THE LAKERS
TO EVER BE A BIGGER DYNASTY

1618
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,191
THAN THE CELTICS?

1619
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,859
THE LAKERS ARE LIKE
A FLARE-UP, A FLUKE,

1620
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,194
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1621
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,462
ARE YOU CRAZY?

1622
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,559
ONE GOOD COACH FOR 4 YEARS.
THE CELTICS ARE A DYNASTY!

1623
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:18,865
AW, COME ON, MAN.

1624
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,200
THE CELTICS, RIGHT?

1625
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,480
THE UGLIEST TEAM IN
THE HISTORY OF SPORTS.

1626
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,604
A DYNASTY OF UGLY
MOTHERFUCKERS, MAN.

1627
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,840
LOOK AT KEVIN McHALE.

1628
01:22:26,892 --> 01:22:27,892
JAMES WORTHY.

1629
01:22:27,926 --> 01:22:29,626
THEY GUY HAS A
HEAD LIKE A MELON.

1630
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:30,994
NO, HE HAD LADIES.

1631
01:22:31,063 --> 01:22:32,312
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU.

1632
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,792
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1633
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:35,198
YOU ARE TWEAKING.

1634
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,666
BOSTON CELTICS.

1635
01:22:36,736 --> 01:22:37,868
HOW MANY IS THAT?

1636
01:22:37,937 --> 01:22:38,869
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1637
01:22:38,938 --> 01:22:39,970
ENOUGH? ALL RIGHT.

1638
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:45,142
YOU GOT THAT?

1639
01:22:49,949 --> 01:22:51,381
I LOST COUNT, MAN.

1640
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,883
DOESN'T MATTER, MAN.

1641
01:22:52,952 --> 01:22:54,051
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1642
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,320
WHO'S COUNTING ANYWAY?

1643
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:04,762
ALL RIGHT, SO I WANNA
KNOW SOMETHING.

1644
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,898
WHAT THE FUCK
LANDED YOU IN HERE?

1645
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:10,150
YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY, TOO
SKINNY FOR A GANGBANGER...

1646
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,518
OH, AIN'T THAT A BITCH?

1647
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:12,897
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER, MAN.

1648
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,366
I CAN THROW THESE
THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

1649
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,688
YEAH. WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

1650
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,224
COME ON. WHAT'D YOU DO?

1651
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,903
NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

1652
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,405
IT'S EMBARRASSING, ALL RIGHT?

1653
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:22,429
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
GODDAMN BUSINESS.

1654
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:24,347
COME ON. WHAT? EMBARRASSED?

1655
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,849
EVERYBODY IN HERE
IS EMBARRASSED.

1656
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,285
NOBODY IN HERE GOT
AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

1657
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:30,788
WHAT'D YOU DO?

1658
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,358
LOOK, MAN, I STOLE
A TV, ALL RIGHT?

1659
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,526
SO YOU STOLE A TV.

1660
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,061
WHAT'S EMBARRASSING ABOUT THAT?

1661
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,880
I STOLE A TV FROM A STORE

1662
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,926
THAT WAS RIGHT NEXT
DOOR TO A DOUGHNUT SHOP.

1663
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:42,883
I RAN OUT,

1664
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,885
THE STORE OWNER'S
BEHIND ME YELLING.

1665
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,820
BAM! I RUN INTO 3
COPS, ALL RIGHT?

1666
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:49,322
OH, SEE? SEE, I TOLD YOU
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

1667
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,323
YOU'RE LAUGHING.

1668
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:52,258
WAIT A SEC, WAIT A SEC.

1669
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:54,728
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE.

1670
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:58,699
NAH, YOU DIDN'T GET 6
YEARS FOR STEALING A TV, MAN.

1671
01:23:58,767 --> 01:23:59,900
COME ON.

1672
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,835
I GO IN THE STORE, I COME OUT,

1673
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,381
THE POLICE OFFICER GRABS MY ARM,

1674
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,349
THE TV FALLS ON HIS
FOOT AND BREAKS IT.

1675
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,008
THEY SAID I THREW
THE TV AT THE OFFICER.

1676
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:09,843
ASSAULT. 6 YEARS.

1677
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,678
COME ON. TELL THE TRUTH.

1678
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:13,279
YOU CHUCKED IT AT HIM...

1679
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,280
SOMETHING.

1680
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,782
LIKE I SAID,

1681
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,351
I CAME OUT OF THE STORE,
HE GRABBED MY ARM,

1682
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,854
IT<i> FELL</i> ON HIS FOOT.

1683
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,010
COME ON NOW.

1684
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:28,345
WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME?

1685
01:24:28,413 --> 01:24:29,713
WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME, HUH?

1686
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,182
THERE YOU GO, BABY!

1687
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:34,500
YEAH! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1688
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:42,827
BAM!

1689
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:14,390
FUCK YOU!

1690
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:16,209
GIVE ME A TOWEL. HOLD HIM.

1691
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,419
YOU WANNA BE A
NIGGER, SWEET BOY?

1692
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:26,420
FUCK YOU!

1693
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:28,021
WE GONNA TREAT YOU LIKE ONE.

1694
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,389
NO.

1695
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,157
COME ON.

1696
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,158
AAH!

1697
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,159
AAH!

1698
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,862
Convict: COME
ON, GIVE IT TO HIM!

1699
01:25:46,124 --> 01:25:47,608
FUCK YOU!

1700
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:48,676
AHH.

1701
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,080
THAT WAS REAL SWEET.

1702
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,182
FUCK YOU!

1703
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:28,883
HOW IS HE?

1704
01:26:30,085 --> 01:26:32,286
WELL, HE TOOK 6 STITCHES.

1705
01:27:13,879 --> 01:27:16,813
MAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

1706
01:27:16,882 --> 01:27:18,314
WELL, I CAME TO
TALK ABOUT DANNY,

1707
01:27:18,383 --> 01:27:19,949
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

1708
01:27:20,018 --> 01:27:21,968
I BROUGHT YOU SOME BOOKS.

1709
01:27:24,389 --> 01:27:26,034
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW?

1710
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:27,698
DON'T KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

1711
01:27:27,726 --> 01:27:30,660
HE'S HEADED RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

1712
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:32,328
OH, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT?

1713
01:27:32,397 --> 01:27:34,375
MY MOTHER ALREADY
LAID THIS TRIP ON ME, MAN.

1714
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:37,067
I'M... DANNY'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

1715
01:27:37,135 --> 01:27:38,880
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO DO WITH THAT?

1716
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:40,170
IT DOESN'T HELP ME.

1717
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:41,716
AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL GUILTY?

1718
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:43,673
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING.

1719
01:27:43,742 --> 01:27:45,842
I NEED TO KNOW THE
TRUTH ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.

1720
01:27:45,911 --> 01:27:47,889
WELL, WHAT YOU THINK
I WANT HIM IN HERE?

1721
01:27:47,913 --> 01:27:49,345
I MEAN...

1722
01:27:49,414 --> 01:27:50,346
I DON'T KNOW.

1723
01:27:50,415 --> 01:27:51,893
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.

1724
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:54,050
I'M ALL...

1725
01:27:54,136 --> 01:27:56,203
I FEEL A LITTLE INSIDE OUT.

1726
01:27:56,254 --> 01:27:58,188
I'M, YOU KNOW... I DON'T KNOW.

1727
01:27:58,256 --> 01:28:00,356
THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT...

1728
01:28:00,425 --> 01:28:02,125
THAT DON'T FIT.

1729
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,293
WELL, THAT HAPPENS.

1730
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,146
LOOK, DEREK, YOU
ARE TOO DAMN SMART

1731
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,026
TO BE FLOATING AROUND HERE
PRETENDING YOU DON'T SEE

1732
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,550
ALL THE HOLES IN THIS BULLSHIT.

1733
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,530
HEY, LISTEN. I SAID
I WAS CONFUSED.

1734
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:14,714
I DIDN'T SAY I
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN I.

1735
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,806
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHY
YOU HAVE TO STAY OPEN.

1736
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,308
RIGHT NOW, YOUR ANGER
IS CONSUMING YOU HERE.

1737
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:22,545
YOUR ANGER IS SHUTTING
DOWN THE BRAIN GOD GAVE YOU.

1738
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,830
GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

1739
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:25,876
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME

1740
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,334
SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

1741
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,380
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ME?

1742
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:31,688
NO, I KNOW ABOUT ME.

1743
01:28:31,757 --> 01:28:33,322
I KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE.

1744
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,324
I KNOW ABOUT THE
PLACE YOU ARE IN.

1745
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,492
HMMPH.

1746
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,172
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE PLACE I'M IN?

1747
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:40,329
THERE WAS A MOMENT...

1748
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:43,332
WHEN I USED TO BLAME
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE

1749
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:45,835
FOR ALL THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

1750
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,004
AND VILE THINGS
THAT HAPPENED TO ME,

1751
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,606
THAT I SAW HAPPEN TO MY PEOPLE.

1752
01:28:50,675 --> 01:28:52,441
USED TO BLAME EVERYBODY.

1753
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:54,360
BLAMED WHITE PEOPLE,
BLAMED SOCIETY,

1754
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,029
BLAMED GOD.

1755
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:57,363
I DIDN'T GET NO ANSWERS

1756
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:59,232
'CAUSE I WAS ASKING
THE WRONG QUESTIONS.

1757
01:28:59,284 --> 01:29:01,785
YOU HAVE TO ASK
THE RIGHT QUESTION.

1758
01:29:01,853 --> 01:29:02,952
LIKE WHAT?

1759
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:08,308
HAS ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE
MADE YOUR LIFE BETTER?

1760
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:20,654
NO.

1761
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,246
YOU GOTTA HELP ME, MAN.

1762
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,767
JUST HELP ME.

1763
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,672
GET ME OUT OF HERE, YOU KNOW?

1764
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:44,110
I'M UP IN 4 MONTHS FOR REVIEW.

1765
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:47,881
PUT IN... PUT IN A WORD FOR ME.

1766
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:49,165
I ALREADY HAVE.

1767
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:50,511
SO YOU'RE OUT
THERE, AND THEN WHAT?

1768
01:29:50,535 --> 01:29:53,336
I DON'T WANT TO FUCK
UP MY FAMILY ANYMORE.

1769
01:29:53,404 --> 01:29:55,638
I'LL GO AS FAR
AWAY AS I CAN GET.

1770
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,457
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1771
01:29:57,509 --> 01:29:59,008
YOU WANT MY HELP,

1772
01:29:59,077 --> 01:30:00,910
YOU GOTTA DO BETTER THAN THAT.

1773
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,446
MY HELP IS NOT UNCONDITIONAL.

1774
01:30:03,515 --> 01:30:06,616
RUNNING JUST AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

1775
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,384
FUCK HIM.

1776
01:30:41,452 --> 01:30:42,719
FUCK HIM.

1777
01:30:42,787 --> 01:30:44,353
FUCK HIM. LET THE
NIGGERS HAVE HIM.

1778
01:30:45,957 --> 01:30:47,256
YO, WHAT'S UP, D?

1779
01:30:47,325 --> 01:30:50,393
YO, WHAT'S ALL THAT BULLSHIT
YOU PULLED IN THE MESS HALL?

1780
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,614
YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKIN'
MIND? ARE YOU FUCKIN' CRAZY?

1781
01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:56,883
D, LOOK AT ME, MAN!

1782
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,569
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
IN HERE ON YOUR OWN.

1783
01:30:59,655 --> 01:31:01,266
LOOK, I'M NOT AFRAID OF
THOSE FUCKIN' PUSSIES, OK?

1784
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,840
THERE WAS 6 OF THEM,
AND THEY JUMPED ME.

1785
01:31:03,909 --> 01:31:06,275
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
I HOPE THEY FUCKIN' TRY.

1786
01:31:06,344 --> 01:31:08,844
LOOK, MAN, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PECKERWOOD FRIENDS!

1787
01:31:08,914 --> 01:31:11,180
THEY'RE PROTECTING
YOUR STUPID ASS!

1788
01:31:11,249 --> 01:31:13,366
YOU DISSED THEM IN PUBLIC!

1789
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:15,068
NOW YOU'RE ON YOUR FUCKIN' OWN!

1790
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,871
YO, MAN, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BROTHERS, ALL RIGHT?

1791
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,806
THEY'RE GONNA FUCK
YOU, TORCH YOUR CELL,

1792
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,085
THEN SMOKE YOUR
MOTHERFUCKING ASS!

1793
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:23,710
OH, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW?

1794
01:31:23,779 --> 01:31:25,912
YOU THINK I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

1795
01:31:25,964 --> 01:31:27,730
IF THEY COME FOR ME, THEY COME.

1796
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:29,299
THERE AIN'T NOTHING I CAN DO.

1797
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,451
WHAT CAN I DO, MAN?

1798
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:39,876
Derek: SO I WAS RIGHT
BACK WHERE I STARTED.

1799
01:31:39,945 --> 01:31:41,945
EVERY DAY I WAS
SURE IT WAS MY DAY.

1800
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:46,166
EVERY TIME I STEPPED
OUT OF MY CELL,

1801
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:48,835
EVERY TIME I GOT IN THAT SHOWER,

1802
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,890
I FIGURED IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

1803
01:31:53,959 --> 01:31:55,825
BEFORE THEY MADE A MOVE.

1804
01:31:57,128 --> 01:31:59,161
I JUST HOPED IT'D BE QUICK.

1805
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:33,146
BUT IT NEVER CAME.

1806
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:36,216
I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT,

1807
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,262
'CAUSE I KNEW SOME OF
THEM WERE ITCHING FOR IT.

1808
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,386
AFTER AWHILE, JUST
PUT MY HEAD DOWN

1809
01:32:40,455 --> 01:32:42,388
AND READ THE STUFF
THAT SWEENEY SENT ME,

1810
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:43,823
AND I KEPT TO MYSELF.

1811
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,894
LAST 6 MONTHS IN THAT PLACE

1812
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:49,528
I WAS LIKE A GHOST.

1813
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,812
WHAT'S UP, MAN? YOU GETTING OUT?

1814
01:33:08,033 --> 01:33:09,132
COME ON, MAN.

01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,360
WHAT THE FUCK YOU WAITING ON?

1816
01:33:10,402 --> 01:33:11,901
GET THE FUCK ON

1817
01:33:13,905 --> 01:33:15,905
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I GOT
THIS FUNNY FEELING.

1818
01:33:15,973 --> 01:33:17,706
OH, YEAH? WHAT'S THAT?

1819
01:33:19,244 --> 01:33:21,577
I'M THINKING MAYBE

1820
01:33:21,646 --> 01:33:23,724
I'M GETTING OUT OF
HEE IN ONE PIECE IS YOU.

1821

COME ON, MAN! GET

1822
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,850
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
PUT MY NECK ON THE LINE

1823
01:33:27,919 --> 01:33:29,919
FOR SOME CRAZY ASS PECKERWOOD?

1824
01:33:29,988 --> 01:33:31,854
YEAH. RIGHT.

1825
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:33,956
STUPID.

1826
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,314
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

1827
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,987
I OWE YOU, MAN.

1828
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:50,073
MAN, YOU DON'T OWE
ME SHIT, ALL RIGHT?

1829
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,211
YES, I DO.

1830
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,366
YOU'LL BE OUTTA HERE IN NO TIME.

1831
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,790
MAN, IT'S A PIECE
OF CAKE, ALL RIGHT?

1832
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:12,873
JUST TAKE IT EASY ON
THE BROTHERS, ALL RIGHT?

1833
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:13,897
THE BROTHERS!

1834
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:25,791
GOD, MAN.

1835
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,130
SORRY, DEREK.

1836
01:34:31,266 --> 01:34:33,299
SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

1837
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:36,236
WELL, I'M NOT.

1838
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,687
I'M LUCKY.

1839
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:40,639
I FEEL LUCKY, 'CAUSE
IT'S WRONG, DAN.

1840
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:44,922
IT'S WRONG, AND IT
WAS EATING ME UP.

1841
01:34:44,946 --> 01:34:46,879
IT WAS GONNA KILL ME.

1842
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,993
AND I KEPT ASKING
MYSELF ALL THE TIME,

1843
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,384
HOW... HOW DID I
BUY INTO THIS SHIT,

1844
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:52,819
YOU KNOW?

1845
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,484
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE
I WAS PISSED OFF.

1846
01:34:56,508 --> 01:34:58,874
NOTHING I EVER DID...

1847
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,760
EVER TOOK THAT FEELING AWAY.

1848
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,231
I MEAN, I KILLED 2 GUYS,
DANNY. I KILLED THEM.

1849
01:35:07,235 --> 01:35:09,475
AND IT DIDN'T MAKE
ME FEEL ANY DIFFERENT.

1850
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:12,338
JUST GOT ME MORE LOST,

1851
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:14,484
AND I'M TIRED OF FEELING
PISSED OFF, DANNY.

1852
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,409
I'M JUST TIRED OF IT.

1853
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:19,779
AND I'M NOT TELLING
YOU WHAT TO DO.

1854
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:22,448
I'M REALLY NOT.

1855
01:35:23,568 --> 01:35:25,728
BUT I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND...

1856
01:35:27,589 --> 01:35:29,022
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU,

1857
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,050
AND YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

1858
01:35:33,028 --> 01:35:34,894
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1859
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:36,796
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1860
01:35:40,418 --> 01:35:41,634
ALL RIGHT.

1861
01:35:44,255 --> 01:35:45,688
WHEW.

1862
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:47,122
JESUS.

1863
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:03,923
HEY.

1864
01:36:03,992 --> 01:36:05,825
HI. EVERYTHING OK?

1865
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,260
AH, EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

1866
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:08,494
GREAT. YEAH.

1867
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:10,063
YOU WANNA SLEEP IN OUR ROOM?

1868
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:11,064
NO. THANK YOU.

1869
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:12,065
YOU SURE?

1870
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:13,532
YEAH. THIS IS GOOD.

1871
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:15,334
THANK YOU.

1872
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,753
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LET'S GO.

1873
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:39,775
GOOD NIGHT.

1874
01:37:47,078 --> 01:37:49,078
I'M GONNA TAKE A
SHOWER, ALL RIGHT?

1875
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:24,813
Danny: IT'S HARD TO LOOK BACK

1876
01:38:24,882 --> 01:38:27,316
AND SEE THE TRUTH
ABOUT PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

1877
01:38:27,385 --> 01:38:30,336
I THINK IF YOU ASKED DEREK
WHY IT ALL WENT THE WAY IT DID

1878
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,004
AND WHERE IT ALL STARTED,

1879
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:34,840
HE'S STILL SAY IT STARTED WHEN
OUR FATHER WAS MURDERED.

1880
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,293
Danny: THE TRUTH IS,
IT STARTED EARLIER.

1881
01:38:38,363 --> 01:38:39,695
ALL RIGHT.

1882
01:38:39,764 --> 01:38:41,625
ARE WE ALL MEETING
FOR THE GAME TONIGHT?

1883
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:42,848
YES. DEFINITELY.

1884
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,834
ALL RIGHT, BEN'S BURGER AT 7:00,

1885
01:38:44,902 --> 01:38:46,862
THEN WE GO WATCH
THE BIG GUY PLAY.

1886
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:48,337
Mom: OK. YEAH.

1887
01:38:48,406 --> 01:38:50,384
PSYCHING UP FOR THE GAME?

1888
01:38:50,408 --> 01:38:51,841
YEAH, I'M ALWAYS READY FOR THAT.

1889
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:53,476
I... I GOT AN ENGLISH
EXAM THIRD PERIOD.

1890
01:38:53,544 --> 01:38:54,744
I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

1891
01:38:54,812 --> 01:38:55,845
I'M NOT READY.

1892
01:38:55,913 --> 01:38:57,924
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AFRAID YOU'LL GET A "B?"

1893
01:38:57,948 --> 01:38:59,326
HA HA. MIGHT DO YOU GOOD.

1894
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,816
"B" MINUS.

1895
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:02,284
HEY, DON'T LAUGH.

1896
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,831
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS
GUY IS DIFFERENT.

1897
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,288
DR. SWEENEY. THIS
GUY'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1898
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,357
UNBELIEVABLE. I'VE NEVER
HAD A TEACHER LIKE THIS.

1899
01:39:08,426 --> 01:39:09,692
HE'S GOT, LIKE, 2 Ph.D.s.

1900
01:39:09,761 --> 01:39:11,304
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S

1930
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,426
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT
MAKING EVERYTHING EQUAL.

1931
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:23,866
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

1932
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:25,868
NOW YOU GOT THIS
BOOK <i>NATIVE SON.</i>

1933
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,915
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
OTHER BOOKS IN THE COURSE?

1934
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:31,106
THEY'RE NOT ANY GOOD ANYMORE
'CAUSE MR. 2 Ph.D. SAYS SO?

1935
01:40:31,175 --> 01:40:32,391
HUH?

01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,893
NOW YOU GOTTA TRADE IN
GREAT BOOKS FOR BLACK BOOKS?

1937
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:36,295
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

1938
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:37,563
HUH?

1939
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,732
YOU GOTTA QUESTION
THESE THINGS, DEREK.

1940
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,734
YOU GOTTA LOOK AT
THE WHOLE PICTURE.

1941
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,402
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOOKS HERE,

1942
01:40:43,471 --> 01:40:44,998
BUT I'M ALSO TALKING
ABOUT MY JOB.

1943
01:40:45,022 --> 01:40:47,890
I GOT 2 BLACK GUYS
ON MY SQUAD NOW

1944
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,392
WHO GOT THEIR JOB OVER
A COUPLE OF WHITE GUYS

1945
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,495
WHO ACTUALLY SCORED
HIGHER ON THE TEST.

1946
01:40:52,563 --> 01:40:54,396
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

1947
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:55,897
HUH?

1948
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:57,544
YEAH, SURE,
EVERYTHING'S EQUAL NOW,

1949
01:40:57,568 --> 01:40:59,528
BUT I GOT 2 GUYS
WATCHING MY BACK,

1950
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,837
RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE,

1951
01:41:01,905 --> 01:41:03,550
WHO AREN'T AS GOOD
AS 2 OTHER GUYS.

1952
01:41:03,574 --> 01:41:05,402
THEY ONLY GOT THE JOB
BECAUSE THEY WERE BLACK,

1953
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,693
NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BEST.

1954
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,195
THAT... THAT SUCKS.

1955
01:41:09,264 --> 01:41:10,841
YEAH. IS THAT WHAT
AMERICA'S ABOUT?

1956
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:12,865
NO, AMERICA'S ABOUT
BEST MAN FOR THE JOB.

1957
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:15,034
YOU DO YOUR BEST,
YOU GET THE JOB.

1958
01:41:15,103 --> 01:41:18,037
THIS AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION CRAP...

1959
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:19,872
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.

1960
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:24,043
THERE'S LIKE SOME HIDDEN
AGENDA OR SOMETHING GOING ON.

1961
01:41:24,112 --> 01:41:25,528
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

1962
01:41:25,596 --> 01:41:26,862
YEAH, I DO.

1963
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:28,864
I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

1964
01:41:28,932 --> 01:41:29,865
WELL...

1965
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:31,867
THIS GUY, THOUGH...
I DON'T KNOW.

1966
01:41:31,935 --> 01:41:34,002
DR. SWEENEY, HE COMES
ON, LIKE, SO STRONG.

1967
01:41:34,071 --> 01:41:35,871
IT'S KINDA HARD NOT
TO LISTEN TO HIM,

1968
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:38,440
BUT MAYBE SOME OF
WHAT HE SAYS IS KINDA...

1969
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:39,608
IT'S BULLSHIT.

1970
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:41,894
YEAH.

1971
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,061
YEAH, MAYBE.

1972
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:44,163
NO, NO.

1973
01:41:44,215 --> 01:41:46,815
IT'S NIGGER BULLSHIT.

1974
01:41:49,304 --> 01:41:50,948
YOU SEE THAT, DON'T YOU?

1975
01:41:50,972 --> 01:41:52,038
YEAH.

1976
01:41:52,089 --> 01:41:53,934
YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR THAT.

1977
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:55,858
YEAH. NO, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1978
01:41:55,927 --> 01:41:56,927
I WILL.

1979
01:41:58,462 --> 01:41:59,462
GOOD BOY.

1980
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:02,514
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

1981
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:04,116
YEAH. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. I GOT IT.

1982
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:11,827
Danny: AND IN ABOUT MINUTE,

1983
01:44:11,896 --> 01:44:14,412
I'M GONNA WATCH THE SUN COME UP.

1984
01:44:14,482 --> 01:44:16,615
I DON'T KNOW IF
I'VE EVER DONE THAT.

1985
01:44:17,885 --> 01:44:19,863
ANYWAY, WE'RE GONNA
TRY TO PICK THINGS UP

1986
01:44:19,887 --> 01:44:21,219
AND START OVER.

1987
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:22,705
IT WON'T BE EASY,

1988
01:44:22,773 --> 01:44:24,640
BUT WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AGAIN,

1989
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:26,675
AND I FEEL GOOD.

1990
01:44:27,912 --> 01:44:30,846
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PAPER
IS WHAT YOU WANTED...

1991
01:44:30,915 --> 01:44:32,848
IF I HIT THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE

1992
01:44:32,917 --> 01:44:35,084
OR WHATEVER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

1993
01:44:35,152 --> 01:44:37,186
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

1994
01:44:37,254 --> 01:44:38,520
THANKS A LOT.

01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:06,765
OHH. WELL...

01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:08,717
SO I'M OUT OF LUCK.

2004
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:12,866
WELL, I JUST GOTTA CHECK IN,

2005
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,001
THEN I'M GONNA SEE ABOUT
GETTING MY OLD JOB BACK.

2006
01:45:15,025 --> 01:45:16,892

2007
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:17,910

I DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S OK THAT I'M HERE.

2028
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:03,488
I WANT TO BE HERE.

2029
01:46:22,393 --> 01:46:24,104
I'M GONNA GET A PAPER.

2030
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,288

2031
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:42,861

WHAT'S GOING ON?

2041
01:47:10,874 --> 01:47:12,808
CAMERON ALEXANDER AND SETH RYAN

2042
01:47:12,876 --> 01:47:15,311
ARE AT THE I.C.U. AT ST. JOHN'S.

2043
01:47:15,379 --> 01:47:16,856
THEY WERE JUMPED LAST
NIGHT NEAR BEN'S BURGERS.

2044
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,647
HOW BAD?

2045
01:47:18,716 --> 01:47:20,694
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE GONNA LIVE.

2046
01:47:20,718 --> 01:47:22,150
THEN THEY GOT LUCKY.

2047
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,420

2048
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:27,290
OH, WHAT?

2049
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:31,693
WE WERE KINDA HOPING MAYBE
YOU'D TALK TO YOUR OLD CREW...

2050
01:47:31,762 --> 01:47:33,373
OH, COME ON. COME ON. NO WAY.

2051
01:47:33,397 --> 01:47:35,331
IF THERE'S ANYBODY
THEY'RE GONNA LISTEN TO,

2052
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:36,498
IT'S YOU.

2053
01:47:36,567 --> 01:47:38,767
NO. I HATE TO TELL
YOU, BUT I'M OUT, OK?

2054
01:47:38,836 --> 01:47:40,814
THOSE GUYS ARE PROBABLY
GUNNING FOR ME NOW.

2055
01:47:40,838 --> 01:47:42,883
LOOK, WE'RE ASKING FOR
YOUR HELP HERE, DEREK.

2056
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:44,751
WHAT, DID YOU TELL HIM
I WAS GONNA DO THIS?

2057
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:45,775
DEREK.

2058
01:47:51,599 --> 01:47:53,910
THIS HAS GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME ANYMORE.

2059
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:54,866
YES, IT DOES.

2060
01:47:54,935 --> 01:47:56,868
IT HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

2061
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:58,415
GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

2062
01:47:58,439 --> 01:47:59,538
I'M DOING MY BEST!

2063
01:47:59,607 --> 01:48:00,805
I'M GOING LIKE THIS

2064
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:02,352
JUST TO KEEP MY
FAMILY IN THE CLEAR.

2065
01:48:02,376 --> 01:48:03,820
DON'T ASK ME TO FIX
THIS FUCKIN' SITUATION!

2066
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:04,776
I'M NOT ASKING THAT.

2067
01:48:04,845 --> 01:48:05,777
IT WAS THERE BEFORE ME.

2068
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:07,263
YOU HELPED CREATE IT.

2069
01:48:07,331 --> 01:48:08,797
YOU WANNA TAKE A BREAK NOW?

2070
01:48:08,866 --> 01:48:10,565
YOU TAKE A BREAK,
YOU'LL FIND NO PEACE.

2071
01:48:10,634 --> 01:48:13,769
THE WAY TO FIND
PEACE IS TO STICK.

2072
01:48:13,837 --> 01:48:15,849
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE A
FUCKIN' BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

2073
01:48:15,873 --> 01:48:16,805
IT MIGHT.

2074
01:48:16,874 --> 01:48:17,806
NOT A BIT.

2075
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:18,974
IT MIGHT.

2076
01:48:19,043 --> 01:48:21,521
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO?

2077
01:48:21,545 --> 01:48:22,644
DO YOU REALLY KNOW?

2078
01:48:22,713 --> 01:48:23,979
YES. I'M ASKING YOU

2079
01:48:24,048 --> 01:48:25,547
TO DO WHATEVER'S
IN YOUR POWER TO DO.

2080
01:48:27,184 --> 01:48:29,351
OHH, MAN.

2081
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,438
FUCK.

2082
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:39,444
ALL RIGHT.

2083
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:42,892
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

2084
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,394
YOU'RE GONNA GET ME SHOT
BY A BUNCH OF WHITE BOYS.

2085
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:45,350
I DOUBT IT.

2086
01:48:45,419 --> 01:48:46,351
YEAH.

2087
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:48,465
WE'RE ALL GONNA
HAVE A LAUGH AT THAT,

2088
01:48:48,489 --> 01:48:49,489
LET ME TELL YA.

2089
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,135
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM TO SCHOOL.

2090
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,137
I'LL BE BACK IN A HALF AN HOUR.

2091
01:48:54,161 --> 01:48:55,511
COME ON.

2092
01:48:55,579 --> 01:48:56,845
Sweeney: HEY, YOU...

2093
01:48:56,914 --> 01:48:59,348
YOU GOT SOMETHING
GOOD FOR ME THIS MORNING?

2094
01:48:59,417 --> 01:49:01,183
I'LL GIVE IT TO
YOU, DR. SWEENEY.

2095
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:02,184
YEAH, OK.

2096
01:49:02,252 --> 01:49:03,252
ALL RIGHT.

2097
01:49:06,757 --> 01:49:07,690
IT'S COOL?

2098
01:49:07,758 --> 01:49:08,758
UH-HUH.

2099
01:49:13,864 --> 01:49:14,904
COME ON, LET'S GO.

2100
01:49:30,698 --> 01:49:33,832
IT'S JUST SO BAD FOR SETH, MAN.

2101
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,213
I WONDER HOW BAD
THEY GOT FUCKED UP.

2102
01:49:36,237 --> 01:49:38,670
WELL, I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOT DEAD,

2103
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:40,105
BUT OTHER THAN
THAT, I DON'T CARE.

2104
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:43,174
SHOULD WE VISIT HIM?

2105
01:49:43,244 --> 01:49:44,343
VISIT HIM? NO.

2106
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:45,844
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

2107
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:47,912
DEFINITELY NOT.
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

2108
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:49,564
LISTEN, TOO...

2109
01:49:49,633 --> 01:49:51,878
I SAW A CAR CRUISING
BY THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT

2110
01:49:51,902 --> 01:49:53,730
WHEN I PULLED OUT
OF THERE WITH SETH.

2111
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:55,354
IF YOU GET HOME BEFORE ME TODAY,

2112
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,356
JUST GIVE A LOOK AROUND
THE STREET, ALL RIGHT?

2113
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:59,358
MAKE SURE THERE'S
NOTHING GOING ON.

2114
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:00,359
HMMPH.

2115
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,507
OH, MAN, THIS IS BAD.

2116
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:06,181
THEY'RE AFTER YOU, MAN.

2117
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:07,699
IT'LL COOL OFF.

2118
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,868
IF I MADE IT THROUGH
CHINO, YOU KNOW,

2119
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:11,314
THIS SHOULD BE A
PIECE OF CAKE, RIGHT?

2120
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:12,855
YEAH.

2121
01:50:12,923 --> 01:50:14,556
YOU GONNA BE OK?

2122
01:50:14,642 --> 01:50:16,675
YEAH, YEAH.

2123
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,210
OK.

2124
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:20,912
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

2125
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,714
I DON'T KNOW. I'LL WORK IT OUT.

2126
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:24,382
HEY, KEEP YOUR
HEAD UP, ALL RIGHT?

2127
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:25,784
THINGS ARE GONNA BE FINE.

2128
01:50:25,853 --> 01:50:27,786
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

2129
01:50:27,855 --> 01:50:29,554
GO TURN THAT PAPER IN.

2130
01:50:31,442 --> 01:50:33,420
OK. ALL RIGHT. SEE YA.

2131
01:50:33,444 --> 01:50:34,576
HEY. HEY, DAN.

2132
01:50:34,662 --> 01:50:35,827
COME HERE.

01:50:41,786 --> 01:50:43,084
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

2136
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:50,404
HEY, GOOD LUCK, ALL RIGHT?

01:50:50,428 --> 01:50:51,693
YEAH.

2138
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:53,412
SEE YOU LATER.

2139
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,523
LIZZY.

2140
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:00,585
GONNA BE LATE.

2141
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:01,586
YEAH, WE BETTER GO.

2142
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,587
OK.

2143
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,922
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

2144
01:51:26,997 --> 01:51:27,930
BYE.

2145
01:51:27,998 --> 01:51:29,998
I'LL CATCH UP WITH
YOU, ALL RIGHT?

2146
01:51:30,067 --> 01:51:31,150
SEE YOU LATER.

2147
01:52:51,866 --> 01:52:52,981
DEREK, NO!

2148
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:54,894
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

2149
01:52:54,918 --> 01:52:56,718
ALL RIGHT! LET HIM GO!

2150
01:52:59,222 --> 01:53:00,321
OH, NO.

2151
01:53:00,391 --> 01:53:01,956
NO! NO!

2152
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:03,392
NO!

2153
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,427
AW, JESUS.

2154
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:09,399
NO.

2155
01:53:10,434 --> 01:53:11,633
OHH, NO.

2156
01:53:11,701 --> 01:53:13,168
NO!

2157
01:53:13,237 --> 01:53:14,237
NO.

2158
01:53:29,086 --> 01:53:30,852
OH, JESUS.

2159
01:53:30,921 --> 01:53:32,787
GOD, WHAT DID I DO?

2160
01:53:46,453 --> 01:53:48,887
OHH, GOD.

2161
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:50,656
OH, MY GOD.

2162
01:54:01,068 --> 01:54:02,668
Danny: SO I GUESS

2163
01:54:02,736 --> 01:54:05,003
THIS IS WHERE I TELL
YOU WHAT I LEARNED.

2164
01:54:05,072 --> 01:54:06,772
MY CONCLUSION, RIGHT?

2165
01:54:07,908 --> 01:54:10,008
WELL, MY CONCLUSION IS...

2166
01:54:10,077 --> 01:54:11,843
HATE IS BAGGAGE.

2167
01:54:11,912 --> 01:54:15,847
LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO BE
PISSED OFF ALL THE TIME.

2168
01:54:15,916 --> 01:54:17,933
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

2169
01:54:20,837 --> 01:54:24,339
DEREK SAYS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO END A PAPER WITH A QUOTE.

2170
01:54:24,408 --> 01:54:26,841
HE SAYS SOMEONE ELSE
HAS ALREADY SAID IT BEST,

2171
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:28,843
SO IF YOU CAN'T TOP IT,

2172
01:54:28,912 --> 01:54:31,346
STEAL FROM THEM
AND GO OUT STRONG.

2173
01:54:31,415 --> 01:54:33,781

THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE.
