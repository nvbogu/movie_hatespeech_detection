Well, since you asked...

462

- So you're a crazy son of a bitch, huh?

we'd have to deal with Chief Bridges.

494
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,471
Sergeant Trapp, Ron spoke
to the man on the phone.

495
00:31:18,472 --> 00:31:22,375
All right, when they hear the voice of one of
my guys, they're gonna know the difference.

496
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:26,511
- How so, Chief?
- You want me to spell it out for you?

497
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:31,852
They're going to know the difference between
how a white man talks and a Negro.

498
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,386
How exactly does a black man talk?

499
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:37,090
Okay, Ron, what I think the
chief is trying to say...

500
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:38,825
If you don't mind, I'd like to speak for myself.

501
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:39,892
- Thank you, Sarge.
- Sure.

502
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:42,963
- You know what I'm trying to say.
- Chief, some of us can speak King's English.

503
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:44,865
Others speak jive.

504
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:48,301
Ron Stallworth here happens
to be fluent in both.

Okay, Ron, how do you propose
to make this investigation?

507
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:59,012
Well, I've established contact and created some
familiarity with the Klansman over the phone.

508
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:01,414
I'll continue in that role, but
I'll need another officer...

509
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:05,685

me when they meet face-to-face.

510
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:09,722
- See, that's my point exactly.
- Chief, black Ron Stallworth over the phone,

511
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:14,333
white Ron Stallworth face-to-face, so there
becomes a combined Ron Stallworth.

512
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,396
- Can you do that?
- I believe we can.

513
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:19,154
With the right white man, we can do anything.

to cut out near Pueblo.

Hmm.

768
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:31,258
- Why were you at Brother Kwame's speech?
- He's got some good ideas.

769
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:36,062
I don't agree with all of them, but he's a
smart brother, definitely worth hearing.

770

Are you down for the liberation of black people?

771
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:42,652
- Do we always have to talk politics?
- What's more important?

I've got a friend.

803
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:14,761
He, uh... keeps up with these groups.

804
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:20,032
He says they're moving away from
the old violent, racist style, so...

805
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:24,071
that's what Duke is peddling now.
It's, uh... becoming mainstream.

806
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:26,439
- Duke?
- David Duke.

807
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,674
Current Grand Wizard of the Klan.

808
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:30,476
But he's always in a three-piece suit,

809
00:47:30,477 --> 00:47:35,414
never seen in a hood or robe in public, and
he now goes by "national director".

810
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:39,575
So he's clearly got his sights on higher office.

811
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:41,821
- Politics? How so?
- Yeah.

812
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:45,224

813
00:47:45,225 --> 00:47:47,027
- Keep going.
- Think about it.

814
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:48,962
Affirmative action, immigration,

815
00:47:48,963 --> 00:47:51,497
- crime, tax reform.
- Hmm.

816
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:54,400
He says no one wants to be
called a bigot anymore.

817
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:56,669
I guess Archie Bunker made that too uncool.

818
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,909
So the idea is, under all these issues,
everyday Americans can accept it,

819
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,612
support it, until eventually, one day,

820
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:10,750

- No suspects.
- Klan?

01:23:57,664 --> 01:24:00,522
thought it might be of interest to you.

attack, I need to know when.

- Sir?
- FBI? Federal Bureau of Investigation?

1439
01:24:18,852 --> 01:24:21,643
We never had this conversation.

- I'm going. We're going.

1442

- What are you talking about?
- I can't get into specifics, but today

1443
01:24:32,932 --> 01:24:36,069
- the Klan is planning an attack.
- Then we have to tell the people.

I don't wear a black beret

screaming, "Kill Whitey,"
