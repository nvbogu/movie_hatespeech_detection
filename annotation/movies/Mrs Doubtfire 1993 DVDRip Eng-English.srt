( "The Barber of Seville" by Rossini)

2
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:22,452
 Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

3
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,331
 Figaro! Son qua

4
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:27,768
 Figaro! Son qua

5
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:34,008
 Figaro qua, Figaro là, Figaro qua, Figaro là,
Figaro su, Figaro giù, Figaro su, Figaro giù

6
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,290
 Pronto prontissimo, son come il fulmine,
sono il factotum della città

7
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:41,525
 Della città, della città,
della città, della città

8
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,604
Phew!

9
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:49,131
 Ah bravo Figaro, bravo bravissimo,
ah bravo Figaro, bravo bravissimo

10
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,932
 A te fortuna, a te fortuna,
a te fortuna non mancherà

11
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,050
 La la la la la la, la la la la la la,
la la la la la la, la la la la

12
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,648
 A te fortuna, a te fortuna,
a te fortuna non mancherà

13
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,566
 Sono il factotum della città

14
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,213
 Sono il factotum della città

15
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:07,603
 Della città, della città

16
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:13,245
 Della città

17
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,282
- Oops.
- Salutations, snack.

18
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,489
Yipe. On second thought...

19
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,924
Yiiipe!

20
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:25,609
9-1-1! 9-1-1!

21
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:28,571
Police! Civic authorities! ASPCA! ASAP!

22
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:31,213
Murder! Betrayal! Kidnapped!

23
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:32,885
No, birdnapped!

24
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:36,692
A cup of garlic, a twist of parakeet.

25
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,162
Eat your heart out, Julia Child.

26
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:45,486
Excuse me, but isn't it customary
for the jailbird to get one telephone call?

27
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,571
In your case, I think not.

28
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:50,167
Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.

29
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:52,289
But I'm not wholly without heart.

30
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,962
How about a nice soothing cigarette?

31
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,003
Pah! Agh! Ugh!

32
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,288
Oh, I will not do this. I cannot!

33
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,652
Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
I don't want to get beak cancer.

34
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,123
No! My lungs are blackened!

35
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,807
Here we go again. Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.

36
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:15,487
- Help me...
- What are you doing? Daniel...

37
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:18,371
That line is not in the script.
Why did you add it?

38
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,763
- I wanted to comment on the situation.
- What situation?

39
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:25,881
Shoving a cigarette into Pudgie's mouth
is morally irresponsible.

40
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:29,648
This is a cartoon,
not a friggin' Oprah Winfrey Special.

41
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,692
Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.
It's like telling them "Light up."

42
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,322
You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
if his mouth isn't moving.

43
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,928
It's voice-over. An interior monologue.
Maybe even the voice of God.

44
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,931
(imperious voice)
Pudgie, don't smoke.

45
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,005
- Actors.
- What? Let's ask the technicians.

46
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:51,086
Do you think it's morally right
to promote smoking to the youth of America?

47
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,085
(whistles)
They're biased. That's a mistrial.

48
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:58,529
Daniel, this session
is costing the studio thousands.

49
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,207
If you want a paycheck, stick to the script.

50
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:05,172
If you want to play Gandhi,
then do it on somebody else's time.

51
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:13,684
(as Gandhi)
Then I've got to do what I've got to do.

52
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,571
That's very funny.
Where the hell are you goin'?

53
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:19,167
If you leave, you're not comin' back in.

54
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:22,086
I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.

55
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:25,131
Well, in the words of Porky Pig:

56
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,649
P-P-P-P-P-P-Piss off, Lou.

57
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:03,332
- So what about that history test?
- Don't ask.

58
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:08,091
- Did you have fun in school?
- I painted a picture of a rainbow.

59
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,324
(whistles)

60
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:13,691
-(both)
Dad? - Daddy!

61
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,084
Daddy!

62
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,328
- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
- Well, I got off early.

63
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,770
- You mean you got fired?
- No, I quit... for reasons of conscience.

64
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:28,808
Actors.

65
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:34,809
(California drawl) Dude, congratulations
on your 12th birthday. Got a surprise for ya.

66
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,884
- A stripper?
- Ooh, please!

67
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,765
- Two strippers?
- Hoo-hah, boy!

68
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,172
- A party?
- Yes!

69
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,244
No. No parties.

70
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,769
Mom said you couldn't have one
because of your report card.

71
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:50,643
(as Jack Nicholson) Mom's not gonna be
home for another four hours, is she?

72
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,801
Prepare yourself... for the wild kingdom.

73
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,684
(hisses like a snake)

74
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:19,572
Coming up toward the very end.
There she goes. And she wins that race.

75
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,644
Come on off now. Here we go.

76
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,404
You want to feed him?

77
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,764
See if this guy will.

78
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,170
Oops. Sorry.

79
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,690
Shoo! Get out!

80
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,008
Shoo! Shoo!

81
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:04,041
- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.
- Miranda Hillard, please.

82
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:10,928
I know what you're going for with these
murals, but perhaps if they weren't so large.

83
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:13,652
- And let's do steel windows, not wood.
- Uh-huh.

84
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,567
Eliminate the oriental rug.
Let's try an Aubusson carpet.

85
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,042
- More pink than red.
- Good idea.

86
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,124
Union Square lnn. This is better.

87
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:27,207
More Arts and Crafts. A Dirk Van Erp lamp,
a Stickley chair. Don't be seduced by chintz.

88
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:30,012
Excuse me. Miranda,
can I speak to you for a minute?

89
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,288
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

90
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,364
Just be one minute.

91
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:38,243
I just got off the phone
with a Stuart Dunmeyer.

92
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,769
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- Mm-hm. He said you were acquaintances.

93
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,127
Stuart Dunmeyer?

94
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:47,206
He's putting millions into restoring
the old Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.

95
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:52,083
- He wants to make it into a $500-a-night B&B.
- Yes, I read about it.

96
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,131
- He's been doing very well.
- Mm-hm, that's him.

97
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,569
And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.

98
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,166
He did?

99
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,245
- I told him you'd call first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, I will.

100
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,643
Miss Hillard? The operator
has a Gloria Chaney on hold.

101
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,930
- She says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.

102
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:13,452
Gloria?

103
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,043
( "Jump Around" by House of Pain)

104
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:28,206
- Oh, my God!
- Is this your residence, ma'am?

105
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,284
Yes, I'm sorry to say it is.

106
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:34,366
Are you aware it's illegal to possess
barnyard animals in a residential area?

107
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:38,241
- What if you're married to one?
- We're also responding to a noise violation.

108
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,485
I'm going to respond myself.
I'm awfully sorry about this. I'll...

109
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,564
You ate my begonias! God!

110
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,884
Get out of my way!

111
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:51,844
(pandemonium)

112
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,924
Jump around

113
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,044
Jump around

114
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,129
Jump around

115
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,488
Jump up, jump up and get down

116
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,531
Everybody jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

117
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,522
Oh... Shoo! Get! Get!

118
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,683
I'm the cream of the crop
I rise to the top

119
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,570
I never eat a pig, cos a pig is a cop

120
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:33,121
Or better yet a Terminator
like Arnold Schwarzenegger

121
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,124
Try to play me out, like
as if my name was Sega

122
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,283
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya

123
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,364
Spittin' out lyrics, homey I'll wet ya

124
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,967
I came to get down, I came to get down...

125
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,846
Hah!

126
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,401
Miranda! Whassup?

127
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,122
You're home early, girlfriend.

128
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,522
Havin' a birthday in the house.

129
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,122
What the hell is going on around here?

130
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,727
Don't get mad, honey. Listen.

131
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:01,409
You're home a little early. I was gonna
clean it all up before you got home.

132
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,961
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

133
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,362
Honey... What are you looking for?

134
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,726
I'd be careful. That pony had a lot of water.

135
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,884
(music stops)

136
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,291
Party's over.

137
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,243
(Daniel) She called you
and you bust the birthday party. Great(!)

138
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,882
(Miranda) Don't you dare
make me out to be the monster here, Daniel!

139
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,533
You have all the fun
and I get whatever's left over.

140
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:38,845
- You chose the career.
- I have no choices here. I have no choices!

141
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:42,243
Even when I try to do something fun,
you do it ten times bigger!

142
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,928
I bring home a cake and gifts.
You bring the goddamn San Diego Zoo!

143
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:49,972
- And I have to clean up!
- It's not toxic waste, just a few party plates!

144
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:52,931
Why am I the only one
that feels there has to be rules?

145
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,288
Why do you always
make me out to be the heavy?

146
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,046
I don't. You do it yourself quite naturally.

147
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,808
- You set me up every time to be the bad guy.
- Oh, lighten up, will ya?

148
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,045
You spend too much time with
those corporate clones you used to despise.

149
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,886
I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
It's over!

150
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,964
It's over.

151
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:17,369
Come on, Miranda. We've got problems,
but who doesn't? We could work 'em out.

152
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:21,208
We've been trying to work them out
for 14 years.

153
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:25,923
Come on, please. Listen.
Maybe we need some help, OK?

154
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:29,005
Maybe a family therapist
will help us do this together.

155
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:31,049
It's too late for that.

156
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,524
Well, let's take a vacation with the kids,
as a family. Get you away from work.

157
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,844
You're a different person.
You really are. You're great.

158
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:42,289
Our problems would be waiting for us
when we got back.

159
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:45,604
We'll move, and hopefully
our problems won't follow us.

160
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,843
Daniel, please don't joke.

161
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:50,970
OK.

162
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:57,363
Yeah. We've just grown apart. We're different.

163
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:01,412
- We have nothing in common.
- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.

164
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:10,365
Come on, Miranda. We love each other.

165
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,844
Don't we?

166
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,884
I want a divorce.

167
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,204
(whispers)
No.

168
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,404
We can't. We're a family. You know?

169
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:39,164
I'm so sorry.

170
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,324
Yeah, Ma, he told me all about it.

171
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,644
Yeah, Ma. I heard, I heard.

172
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,211
- Well, yeah, he's here.
- No.

173
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,687
Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.

174
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:34,083
Yeah, depressed.
I mean, his marriage is ending.

175
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:38,246
My marriage is not ending. It's just on hiatus.

176
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,162
Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.

177
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:46,768
No, we're taking good care of your little boy.
Don't worry, Mom.

178
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:50,084
- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
- She says you're welcome.

179
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:53,449
That beige concealer.
When are we gettin' more of it?

180
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,127
- Next week.
- You hear that, Ma? Next week.

181
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:57,925
Wait, hang on.

182
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,652
- Enough already. It's a man.
- How would you know?

183
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,371
Bitch.

184
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,684
No, Ma, not you. I was talkin' about the dog.

185
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,250
Ma, listen. We got people
waitin' for us on the set.

186
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,962
Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.
Places to go, faces to paint.

187
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,490
Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.

188
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:17,325
Don't worry, I'll tell him.

189
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,846
Yeah. Hold on, Ma.

190
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,886
She wants to know
if you want to come stay with her.

191
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,648
- No way.
- He says he'll think about it, Ma.

192
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,483
I will. All right. I love you, too.

193
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,564
Bye, Ma.

194
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:35,604
Hey, listen, you know you can always
stay with us just as long as you want.

195
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,925
Thank you, but I'm OK, really.
I mean, this is just a temporary thing.

196
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:42,652
I know Miranda. It's gonna blow over.

197
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:52,645
Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
proceedings tend to favour the mother,...

198
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:57,807
..we also realise, perhaps now more than
ever, that it is not in a child's best interest...

199
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,965
..to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father.

200
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:09,087
However, since at the present time Mr Hillard
has no place to live and no employment,...

201
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:13,132
..it is the court's ruling
to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.

202
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,408
- (whispers) Congratulations.
- No.

203
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,883
Mr Hillard will have visitation rights
every Saturday.

204
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,282
- Can't you do something?
- He's made his decision.

205
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,570
Isn't it traditional
to say "I object" or something?

206
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:26,371
Your Honour, please.

207
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,768
Every Saturday? That's one day a week.

208
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,128
That's not enough.

209
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:37,162
I have to be with my children. It's not
a question. I have to be with them, sir. Please.

210
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:40,643
I know it seems like a lot,
but for me it's not enough. Really.

211
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:45,249
I haven't been away from 'em for more than
one day since the day they were born.

212
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,042
- Mr Hillard, this ruling is only temporary.
- Oh, good.

213
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:52,205
I will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case.

214
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:55,444
There will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days.

215
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,366
- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
- Thank you.

216
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:02,924
Three months in which to get ajob,
keep it and create a suitable home.

217
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:05,527
If this proves to be a possibility for you,...

218
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:11,210
..I will consider ajoint-custody arrangement
when we reconvene. We're adjourned.

219
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,928
Well, it looks like there is
a little light at the end of our tunnel.

220
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,564
- That's all my stuff.
- This is all my fault.

221
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:51,362
God, no. Why would you think that?

222
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,887
I should have never had a birthday, Dad.

223
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:56,771
- This never would have happened.
- Yes, it would.

224
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:00,004
It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?

225
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,527
You did nothing wrong. You got that?

226
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,644
OK, gimme five.

227
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,004
You're the man of the house now.

228
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,084
Don't be messy.

229
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:20,131
- You can't go now.
- Honey, I have to.

230
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:25,289
We're in the middle of 'Charlotte's Web'.
Who's gonna finish it?

231
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:28,327
Well, Grandma will finish it for you.

232
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:35,002
She's not as good. She always skips parts,
and she never does the voices.

233
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,084
She smells funny, too.

234
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,167
That's the formaldehyde.
That's why Granny's so well preserved.

235
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,888
Hey, come here.

236
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:50,967
Hey! It's the same as always.
We just have a really big backyard, OK?

237
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,931
- (whispers) I love you.
- (whispers) I love you.

238
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:00,847
I'll miss you. Saturday comes real quick.

239
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,530
- I'll miss you.
- Ditto.

240
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,771
Oh, Dad...

241
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:11,964
- Take care of her.
- OK.

242
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,084
Goodbye.

243
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:23,442
Thanks for the time, warden.

244
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,564
Bye, Dad.

245
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,397
As your court liaison,
I will be looking at two things.

246
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:57,554
- Your living environment...
- It's more like a habitat, really.

247
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:04,000
And I will be coming by on Monday
and Friday evenings to inspect it.

248
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,992
Well, I'll put on a chicken.

249
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,757
And there's always the job issue.

250
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:14,234
This is the nearest employment office. I took
the liberty of making an appointment for you.

251
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:17,916
- Thank you.
- By the way, do you have any special skills?

252
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,992
Oh, yes. I do.

253
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,037
I do voices.

254
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,671
What do you mean, you do voices?

255
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,710
(German accent)
Vell, I do voices.

256
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,711
Yes!

257
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:31,554
(as alien) We're looking for intelligent life.
Oops, mistake!

258
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,838
(as immigrant) Happy to be in America.
Don't ask for a green card.

259
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,310
(as monster)
I want you in the worst way.

260
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:41,030
(as Groucho Marx) This meeting
is certainly not going well for me.

261
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,636
(as Chico) Hey, boss, give her a chance.
She's gonna loosen up any moment.

262
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:48,509
(as James Bond) Moneypenny,
I want to undo that bow and get to know you.

263
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,956
(as salesman)
I'm crazy to make a deal with you!

264
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,794
(as Ronald Reagan) Nancy and I are
looking for the other half of my head.

265
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:57,510
(as Walter Huston) They're doin' it!
I'm sittin' on a gold mine!

266
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,478
(as Bogart)
Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.

267
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:00,550
 Figaro!

268
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,791
I do a great impression of a hot dog.

269
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:08,355
Mr Hillard, do you
consider yourself humorous?

270
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,432
I used to.

271
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,558
There was a time when I found myself funny.

272
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,633
But today you have proven me wrong.
Thank you.

273
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,877
Listen, bottom line...

274
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:25,350
I need to be with my children,
and I'll do anything to do that.

275
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,432
You just tell me what to do.

276
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,196
- Excuse me. You Tony?
- That's me.

277
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:50,114
Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.

278
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:54,115
Follow me.

279
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,715
Oh, films! Will I be
introducing these movies on air?

280
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,156
- Not exactly.
- What do I do?

281
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:05,358
You take all these cans.
You box 'em and you ship 'em.

282
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,911
Then you box those cans over there.
Ship them. Then more will come in.

283
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,789
You box those, you ship those.

284
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,872
Any questions?

285
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,997
After you box 'em...?

286
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,197
You ship 'em.

287
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:21,272
Lots of luck, smartass.

288
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,559
I think I made a friend.

289
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,479
- Miranda.
- Stu!

290
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:43,956
Hello, Miranda.

291
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,635
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

292
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:53,196
Mr Dunmeyer's come by
to look over your sketches.

293
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,360
Um...

294
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,955
Let me show you to the conference room.

295
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:01,753
As you probably know,
the estate was built in 1876.

296
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:06,153
These sketches are meant to reflect
your desire to have it completely restored.

297
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,152
You look better than ever.

298
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:13,520
The lobby will resemble a music salon with
inspiration from the French Second Empire.

299
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:16,399
I was thinking a 17th-century grand piano...

300
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,917
I've been following your career
these past couple of years.

301
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:24,711
A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
a brass-bound Regency-style table...

302
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:28,396
I'd love to get reacquainted. Catch up.

303
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:32,036
Mantel clocks,...

304
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,874
..fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.

305
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,475
Can we talk? Over dinner, maybe?

306
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:42,394
Stuart, thank you. I... I...

307
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:45,632
I... I'm at the beginning of a divorce.

308
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,072
It just didn't work out.

309
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:52,358
- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to say that.

310
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:56,912
No, really. I mean, I never
held any grudges or anything. I just...

311
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:00,118
Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.

312
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,637
Oh, God, that's so nice.

313
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,919
I was just worried my coming in here
might scare you off the project.

314
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,992
No, no. Of course not. l...

315
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,191
I'm a professional. I'm...

316
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:17,275
I was flattered that you thought of me
after all these years and everything.

317
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,911
Yeah, everything.

318
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,073
Well... Ancient history.

319
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,353
Yeah.

320
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,912
Yeah.

321
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,754
- I'm late. I've got a meeting at the bank.
- Oh.

322
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,115
Can we talk maybe later in the week?

323
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,874
- Sure.
- Good.

324
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,350
It's good to see you again.

325
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,032
(Daniel)
Mmm, good, huh?

326
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,511
I know the place
doesn't look like much now, but...

327
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,990
..it'll be OK. How do you like it?

328
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,790
- Nice.
- It's OK.

329
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,792
Detestable.

330
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,117
Hey, just give me some time.

331
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,319
I'm not too comfortable
with this new lifestyle.

332
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:30,232
Neither are we.

333
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:33,150
I know it's hard, sweetie.

334
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,630
Can't you just tell Mom you're sorry?

335
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,390
Wish I could.

336
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:43,711
You know, grown-up problems...

337
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,520
They're a little more complicated, Nattie.

338
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,751
How is the old battle-axe?

339
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,630
- Your mom.
- She's fine.

340
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:57,110
Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

341
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:02,831
I'd hate to think that she came down
with amoebic dysentery or piles.

342
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:05,116
What's amoebic dysentery?

343
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:09,277
It's an infection in your tummy
where you get diarrhoea for ever.

344
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:13,115
- Diarrhoea for ever?
- And your body dries up and you die.

345
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,318
- You die?
- You don't have to be so graphic with her.

346
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:21,680
- I read about it in a science book.
- Why would you want Mommy to die?

347
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:24,999
Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.

348
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,910
Then why did you say that?

349
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:33,956
Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.

350
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:38,080
We only get to come here once a week.
That's not very much.

351
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:41,756
You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

352
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:46,430
Nattie, I'll think good thoughts, OK?

353
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:51,237
- About Mommy?
- I'll try. I really will.

354
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:55,075
- And call her a princess.
- Oh... Oh, yes.

355
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,677
And right now I feel like a toad. (croaks)

356
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:03,038
(Daniel)
Daddy's a toad.

357
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,798
(car horn)

358
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,795
- That's Mom.
- Can't be. She's an hour early.

359
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,157
Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.

360
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:17,957
No, no! Come on, sit down, sit down.

361
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,713
Sit down!

362
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:22,918
You don't have to run off
when she honks the horn.

363
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,595
Come on, you're on my time now.

364
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:28,593
You're my goddamn kids, too!

365
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,271
Come on. Hey.

366
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,953
Hi.

367
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,114
Oh, Daniel... Charming.

368
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:52,716
Thank you, Miranda.
I was going for a refugee motif.

369
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,110
Fleeing-my-homeland kind of thing.

370
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,158
But look at you!

371
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:01,871
This lovely 'Dances with Wolves' motif.
What's your lndian name: Shops With A Fist?

372
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:05,431
- Are my children ready yet?
- No, our children are not ready yet...

373
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:09,514
..because you are an hour early
and you were late dropping them off.

374
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:15,278
Daniel, I don't have time for this. I have to
drop something off at the newspaper office.

375
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:18,478
Newspaper? Are you taking out
one of those personal ads?

376
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:23,077
"DWF seeks WWWM with BMW,
into light B&D"?

377
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,511
I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.

378
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:29,832
Housekeeper?
Why do you need a housekeeper?

379
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:35,393
I need someone to be there when the children
get home from school, to clean, start dinner...

380
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:38,712
- How much are you gonna pay?
- $300 a week. Is that all right?

381
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,072
300...

382
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,876
- May I see the ad?
-(sighs)

383
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:48,637
- I have a right as their father. Please?
- All right. Anything else you wanna see?

384
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,281
- Are you offering?
- Not any more.

385
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,840
What's the change?

386
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,799
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.

387
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,280
Ugh!

388
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:59,795
Miranda, why not let me
take care of the kids?

389
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:04,557
I'll pick 'em up after school, be with them,
then drop them off at your house after work.

390
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,199
- That'd be great!
- Please!

391
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:08,875
- Look. The kids love it.
- Mommy, please!

392
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,429
I'll think about it.

393
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:18,319
We're his goddamn kids, too.

394
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,638
Kids say the darndest things.

395
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:30,998
Thank you. Any other choice phrases
you'd like to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?

396
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:35,190
Oh...! Come on,
everybody get their coats. Come on.

397
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,512
- Put them on and let's get out of here.
- OK, Mom.

398
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:42,913
I would say go to the bathroom before we go,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

399
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:50,079
Don't forget anything.
I don't wanna come back.

400
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,117
Come on, let's go.

401
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:55,513
- See you Saturday.
- Say goodbye to your father.

402
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,592
Goodbye, Daddy.

403
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,471
- Here's your ad.
- I'll get my purse.

404
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,552
Yeah, you'd better.

405
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,678
(mobile phone rings)

406
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,719
(Miranda) Hello. Are you calling
in response to the ad?

407
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,234
Uh-huh.

408
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:26,599
- Who was your previous employer?
- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.

409
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:29,115
- In a band?
- I just wanna know one thing.

410
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:34,116
Are your kids well-behaved, or do they need,
like, a few light slams every now and then?

411
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,712
- Um... I'll have to get back to you.
-Wow!

412
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:43,514
(German accent)
My name is Ilsa Himmelman.

413
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,557
How many children do you have?

414
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,031
- I have two girls and a boy.
- Oh, a boy!

415
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:52,716
(Swedish accent) I don't work with the males
cos I used to be one.

416
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,475
Yikes.

417
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,793
(phone rings)

418
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,992
- Hello.
-(screams)

419
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:06,597
(Southern US accent) Leyla, get back
in your cell! Don't make me get the hose!

420
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:07,670
Hello?

421
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:15,234
(Spanish accent)
I... am... job.

422
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:20,154
- Do you speak English?
- I... am... job.

423
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:23,274
I'm sorry. The position has been filled.

424
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,750
Oh, what a nightmare!

425
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:30,118
Let's go in for the kill.

426
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,752
(phone rings)

427
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,471
- Hello?
- (as Scottish woman) Hello.

428
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:43,553
I'm calling in regards
to the ad I read in the paper.

429
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:49,315
Yes... Well, would you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

430
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:51,552
Oh, certainly, dear.

431
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:56,431
For the past 15 years I've worked for
the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.

432
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:58,512
That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.

433
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:05,117
And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,
and took care of their four glorious children.

434
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:10,719
Oh, I grew quite attached to them after 15
years, but they grew up, as children tend to.

435
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:15,750
Oh, but listen to me. I am going on when you
should be telling me about your little ones.

436
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,833
- Well, I have two girls...
- Oh, two precious gems.

437
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:21,037
No doubt the jewel of your eye.

438
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:25,239
- And one boy.
- Oh, the little prince. How wonderful.

439
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,633
I must tell you,
a little light cooking is required.

440
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:31,599
Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
I'd love some heavy cooking.

441
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:35,993
But I do have one rule: they'll only eat
good, nutritious food with me.

442
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:40,154
And if there's any dispute, it's either
good, wholesome food or empty tummies.

443
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:43,039
That's my rule.
I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.

444
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,313
No! Um...

445
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:49,519
Would you mind coming on an interview?
Say, Monday night at 7.30?

446
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,320
- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
- Wonderful.

447
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:57,153
I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.

448
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,391
Steiner. Oh, how lovely.

449
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:03,396
- Could you tell me your name?
- My name?

450
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,475
I thought I gave it to you, dear.

451
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,950
- No.
- Oh!

452
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:15,161
- Doubtfire.
- I beg your pardon?

453
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,513
Doubtfire, dear. Mrs Doubtfire.

454
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:22,913
- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.

455
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,390
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

456
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:30,872
Showtime.
(chuckles)

457
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,514
- Daniel, hi.
- Could you make me a woman?

458
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:42,713
Honey, I'm so happy!

459
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,315
- Oh, come here.
- I knew you'd understand.

460
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:50,155
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Don't whine. Just relax.

461
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,074
- Are you sure?
- Just remember, pain is beauty.

462
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,790
- OK, take a deep breath... lnstant eye lift.
- Whoa.

463
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,431
And the strings are under the wig.

464
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:05,915
- The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
- All right, we'll start with make-up.

465
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:09,437
- I'm not gonna wax.
- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.

466
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,877
- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
- You look like her mother.

467
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:16,431
(as Gloria Swanson)
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.

468
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:19,752
OK, everyone... Let's pray.

469
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:26,276
(Spanish accent) I hope you are using
Jungle Red. That is the colour I love.

470
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,352
- Matches your lips.
- God bless you.

471
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:31,672
I'm feeling fabulous
because I met this beautiful Cuban.

472
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:34,070
Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.

473
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,994
I can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.

474
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:41,597
I don't know. This would scare the children.
Maybe this is too much for them.

475
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,311
I think we have to go to the next level.

476
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,198
Latex.

477
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,641
(Yiddish accent)
Oy, it was such a shandeh.

478
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:53,111
I should never buy gribbenes from a mohel.
It's so chewy.

479
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:56,352
- No, I feel like Bubbee. This is not working.
- Don't worry.

480
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,753
It's a work in progress and you're my brother.
I will never let you be embarrassed.

481
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,309
- God bless you.
- We'll have to do the entire face.

482
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,790
But look at this nice thing we have here.

483
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:08,918
 Matchmaker, matchmaker,
make me a match

484
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:11,674
 Find me a find, catch me a catch

485
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,476
 Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter

486
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,836
 Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter

487
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:24,596
 Don't bring around a cloud
to rain on my parade

488
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,397
It's not working. I need to go older.

489
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:31,030
Older? Like Shelley Winters older
or Shirley MacLaine older?

490
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:34,477
- What's the difference?
- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.

491
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:38,110
- What about Joan Collins?
- Oh, I don't think I have the strength.

492
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:40,192
But I have some plaster.

( "Luck Be a Lady Tonight"
by Frank Sinatra)

494
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:48,716
Luck, be a lady tonight

495
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:55,116
Luck, be a lady tonight

496
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:02,800
Luck, if you've ever
been a lady to begin with

497
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:06,876
Luck, be a lady tonight

498
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:16,476
Luck, let a gentleman see

499
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:22,396
How nice a dame you can be

500
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:30,074
I know the way you've treated
other guys you've been with

501
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:34,076
Luck, be a lady with me

502
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,435
Luck, be a lady

503
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:44,078
- Are we close?
- Any closer...

504
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:46,152
..and you'd be Mom.

505
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:54,157
Tonight!

506
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,552
(Nattie)
That's disgusting!

507
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:08,159
- The most revolting thing I've ever seen.
- (doorbell)

508
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,959
Awesome.

509
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:14,071
What is this? Turn it off, will you?

510
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:17,358
Come on. I want you
to meet this lady with me.

511
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:20,877
I want you to be polite to her, then...
tell me what you think.

512
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,159
Everybody stand over here
and help me decide what to do.

513
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,189
Hello. Mrs Hillard, I presume.

514
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,317
Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.

515
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:36,631
Euphegenia Doubtfire.

516
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,996
Yes. Won't you please come in?

517
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,390
Thank you, dear.

518
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:44,794
- And these must be the cherubs.
- Yes.

519
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:48,759
- This is Natalie.
- Oh, hello, Natalie.

520
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,036
- Are you wearing bug spray?
- Nattie!

521
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:55,558
It's quite all right, dear. No offence taken.
I was a little liberal with the atomiser.

522
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:59,759
And at my age, it's like a good Stilton.
Everything has its own aroma.

523
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:04,119
I admire that honesty, Nattie.
That's a noble quality. Never lose that,...

524
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:07,796
..because it often disappears with age
or entering politics.

525
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:11,476
Look at that face.
You remind me of Stuart Little,...

526
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:14,871
..one of the most honourable creatures
in all of literature.

527
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:19,113
- Do you know that book, 'Stuart Little'?
- Yeah! It's one of my favourites.

528
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,989
Mine, too! Maybe I could read it to you -
if I get the position.

529
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,357
- That would be wonderful.
- And who is this strapping young lad?

530
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,636
- This is Chris.
- Hello, Christopher.

531
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,473
Hello.

532
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:34,190
Jeez, you're big for a lady.
You could play for the 49ers.

533
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:38,035
Well, I was a fullback.
But that's European football, dear.

534
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,510
- Soccer?
- Yes. You play soccer, too?

535
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,751
- Yeah!
- Oh, isn't that amazing?

536
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:47,232
Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
We won three university championships.

537
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,312
Oh, but that was decades ago!

538
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:53,713
But I was more disciplined then. I always
put my studies ahead of my athletics.

539
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:57,350
I'm sure you're the same
and you've done all your homework already.

540
00:36:57,441 --> 00:37:00,956
- Well, not exactly.
- Really? Oh. That's a pity.

541
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:06,354
Young men who don't do their studies
often miss out on more amusing activities.

542
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:10,000
- And who is this young lady?
- This is Lydia.

543
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,872
Hello, Lydia.

544
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:19,271
This isn't fair, Mom.
Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?

545
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:21,795
- This is all I need.
- Why can't Dad do it?

546
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:27,479
Dear, I don't think it's appropriate to argue
with your mother in front of a stranger.

547
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,837
I just don't see why
we can't spend the extra time with Dad.

548
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:34,960
Maybe she's right, dear. Maybe their father
would be a more appropriate person.

549
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,430
No, I don't think so.

550
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,912
It's not my fault, honey. If he would
get ajob and a decent apartment...

551
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,152
- You see, he's the kind...
- Excuse me, dear.

552
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:48,278
I'm sure you'd want the children
to step out of the room...

553
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:51,194
..before you verbally bash their father. Hm?

554
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:53,875
If I did that, I might never see them again.

555
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,760
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- No harm done.

556
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:03,312
- You're absolutely right.
- I'm not a therapist. I just see what I see.

557
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:06,359
Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
I'll be up in a minute.

558
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:09,478
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

559
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:11,552
You too, Lydie.

560
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,471
- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
- Yes.

561
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:22,792
- Especially Lydie. She's got daggers for you.
- I know.

562
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:26,510
- They're very upset with me right now.
- Probably the divorce.

563
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:28,592
How did you know?

564
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,832
You can sense it, dear -
the way she talks about her father.

565
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:37,314
I don't think he's in the Navy, the way she's
saying she misses him. It's like he's nearby.

566
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,312
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sad.

567
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,040
- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
- I'd love that.

568
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,874
- It's right in here.
- What a lovely home you have.

569
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:47,191
- Did you decorate this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

570
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:51,638
Oh, it reeks of taste! Isn't this lovely, dear!

571
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:54,713
- Here's my ré'sumé'.
- Oh. Thank you.

572
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:58,032
- Let me start this tea.
- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.

573
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:04,037
You've had a hard day. You just sit yourself
down on that stool and leave the tea to me.

574
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:06,874
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

575
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:08,952
Oh, not at all, dear.

576
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,794
- Oh. What a wonderful ré'sumé'.
- Thank you, dear.

577
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:14,516
"Expert in first aid and CPR."

578
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,592
And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.

579
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:20,037
You can never be too prepared
when little ones are around.

580
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:23,796
They'll swallow anything.
You've got to be ready to pop it out.

581
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:26,792
Oh, let's see.

582
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:30,590
Oh! What a perfectly appointed little cubby!

583
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:34,674
Look at this. Everything
has its place and name tag.

584
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:37,594
How precise! It's lovely.

585
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,672
My husband never appreciated it.

586
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,752
Oh. Poor dolt.

587
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,719
That's not the reason
you divorced him, was it?

588
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,715
No.

589
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:51,390
It's so sad, because marriage
can be such a blessing.

590
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:54,712
- So can divorce.
- Oh.

591
00:39:54,921 --> 00:40:01,793
Daniel is a... very difficult man to live with.
But the children are crazy about him.

592
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:05,510
You don't have to be a psychic to sense that.

593
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,557
My, you certainly do know your way
around a kitchen!

594
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,313
Oh! Uh...

595
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:15,314
It's just because everything is so accessible.
You designed it.

596
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:19,754
I'm amazed there isn't a little label there
that says "spoons".

597
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:24,834
You remind me of someone.

598
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:28,235
Really? Who?

599
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:32,396
I feel like I've known you for years.

600
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:36,631
Maybe we knew each other in another life.
(chuckles)

601
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:41,592
I would love for you
to come and work with us.

602
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,195
- So would l.
- Great!

603
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,272
It would be an honour.

604
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:49,276
To us.

605
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,831
To us. The start of a business relationship.

606
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:06,112
(mutters and curses)

607
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:23,912
Good evening, dear.

608
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,632
Evening, ma'am.

609
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,396
Cold night, isn't it?

610
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,597
Yes, it is.

611
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:41,914
Hope you have somethin' nice and warm
to go home to.

612
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:56,277
(as Daniel)
My back.

613
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:01,754
Jesus! If I find the misogynistic bastard
that invented heels, I'll kill him.

614
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,592
God...!

615
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:14,479
Excuse me.

616
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:16,472
Mrs Sellner!

617
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:19,791
Have we met?

618
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:22,953
No. But Danny's told me all about you.

619
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:26,321
I'm his sister.

620
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,237
His... much older sister.

621
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,838
- You have his eyes.
- Only if he fills out a donor card.

622
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,912
(chuckles)

623
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:40,597
- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.

624
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:43,115
Let me go up and get him
and he'll be right down.

625
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:44,714
- I'll come with you.
- No.

626
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:46,120
- Yes.
- Why?

627
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:51,958
Because I have an appointment on Monday
and Friday evenings to check the apartment.

628
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,794
I remember him saying something about that.

629
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:58,237
Are you sure, dear?
It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.

630
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:00,676
- If you can do it, I can.
- I'll bet so!

631
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:02,752
- Is your ticker all right?
- Topnotch.

632
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:06,311
Oh, good! Cos I don't want
to jump-start ya. (chuckles)

633
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,160
Damn door.

634
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:13,153
Come in, please, dear. Sorry about that.

635
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,232
Here we are. Daniel's abode.

636
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:21,116
Oh, that's mine, dear.
I'm a messy house guest.

637
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:24,193
Well, just make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

638
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:26,272
He'll be back. I'll go get him.

639
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,353
Don't be afraid. I'll be right there. Danny!

640
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:33,036
Danny boy, where are you?
Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.

641
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:35,681
Danny, there's a Mrs Sellner here to see you!

642
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:38,036
-(as Daniel) Oh, is she here?
- Yes, she is.

643
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:41,433
(as Daniel) Mrs Sellner,
I just got out of the shower!

644
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,910
I think you'll be very pleased with me!

645
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:47,277
I've been through
some really interesting changes!

646
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:50,797
And I'm becoming a new man
and a model father!

647
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,953
He'll be right there. He's just changing, dear.

648
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:59,357
(as Daniel) I want to keep you abreast
of the changes in my career!

649
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:03,832
There have been two big developments!
I'm finally starting to come into my own!

650
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:08,119
Things are really starting to take shape,
and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!

651
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:10,431
Things were hairy for a while,...

652
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:13,558
..but oh! I'm in great shape now!

653
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:16,030
I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!

654
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,039
A job I could really sink my teeth into!

655
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,191
I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!

656
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:29,035
So nice I don't have to
save face any more, Mrs Sellner!

657
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:35,360
- (shrieks)
- Mrs Sellner! How are you? Always ajoy!

658
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:38,592
If you wanted some cheese,
why didn't you just say so?

659
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:42,311
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I now am holding down two jobs.

660
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:46,189
One for an educational film and TV company
-heavy responsibility.

661
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:50,479
- And the other?
- Cleaning houses. Not mine.

662
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,276
- Big girl!
- Your sister is English?

663
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,431
She's half-English, half-American.

664
00:44:56,521 --> 00:45:00,594
Half-sister, really. That makes her
an eighth English? I've never done the math.

665
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:05,197
Let me see, my father was American.
He... flew for the English during the war.

666
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:08,796
He was in London and...
he met this lovely Englishwoman.

667
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:11,918
Well, my sister was the fruit of their passions.

668
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,152
- (shrieks)
- Sorry. My sister's, not yours.

669
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:20,474
You see, she's not a very good housekeeper.
But she makes a fabulous cup of English tea.

670
00:45:20,561 --> 00:45:24,031
Really? Well, I would adore
a good cup of English tea.

671
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,397
Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

672
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:30,075
Sis! Oh, sis!

673
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,152
Sis, are you in here?

674
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,835
(mutters)
Tea? Cup of TNT.

675
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,790
(boys giggle)

676
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:53,832
(boy)
Sick. Mom!

677
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:58,231
Whoa!

678
00:45:58,321 --> 00:45:59,834
My face!

679
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,032
I've gotta go down and get it.

680
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:10,112
(boys giggle)

681
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,556
Argh! Norman Bates!

682
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:28,399
(creak)

683
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:35,551
Miss Hillard?

684
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:38,633
-(as Mrs Doubtfire) Yes, dear?
- I take sugar in my tea.

685
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:40,712
Oh, your tea!

686
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,269
I'll be right there with your tea!

687
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:49,951
Coming right up, dear!
Sugar - one lump or two, dear?

688
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:53,238
- Two, please!
- Tea, sugar, hot water.

689
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:56,631
You got it - argh!
Coming right your way, dear!

690
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:58,791
I'll be right there with your tea!

691
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,511
(truck horn)

692
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:03,439
No! Stop!

693
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,079
Stop!

694
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,436
No!

695
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:13,194
Oh... shit!

696
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,278
Ow! Ohhh!

697
00:47:19,481 --> 00:47:23,918
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, dear! I don't need a hand.

698
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,515
(mutters)
I need a face. A face.

699
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:30,996
- Are you sure?
- Oh, definitely!

700
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:40,076
I'm not a Muslim.
I need a face. A face. Oh, God.

701
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:46,551
Miss Hillard? The water's boiling.

702
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:49,440
- Hello!
- Argh!

703
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:54,390
Oh, I'm sorry to frighten you, dear.
I must look like a yeti in this get-up.

704
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:58,235
This is my nightly meringue mask.
Part of my beauty regimen.

705
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:03,236
It's basically egg whites, crème fraîche,
powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of alum.

706
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:08,395
There you go, dear. Oh! You've got your
cream and sugar. It's a little cappu-tea-no.

707
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:10,637
One drop or two? Would you like another?

708
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,235
Oh! There you go! (chortles)

709
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:17,712
As you can see, I can't stay with you, dear.
I'm melting like a snow cone in Phoenix.

710
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:22,716
There we go again! I'll go get Danny.
He'll be right with you. Hold on.

711
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:25,918
- Danny!
- (as Daniel) Coming, sis!

712
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:29,437
- It was lovely to have met you!
- Lovely to meetyou.

713
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:51,400
- Had a little accident.
- Be careful this time. She's an old woman.

714
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:55,875
Why wasn't I an only child?

715
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:59,234
( "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"
by James Brown)

716
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:01,312
(bell rings)

717
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:05,552
He ain't too hip

718
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:08,797
'Bout that new breed thing

719
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,916
Ain't no drag

720
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:15,912
Papa's got a brand new bag

721
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:20,272
Come here, Mama

722
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,032
And dig this crazy scene

723
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,032
He's not too fancy

724
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,232
But his mind is pretty clean

725
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:32,471
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

726
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:34,916
He ain't no drag

727
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:37,512
Papa's got a brand new bag

728
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:40,596
Hey! Come on

729
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:45,152
Ready? OK.

730
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:47,232
- Did you have fun in school?
- Uh-huh.

731
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,119
- What did you do?
- I painted a picture of a bunny...

732
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:52,396
- ..and the teacher liked it.
- She did?

733
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,755
Uh-huh.

734
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:57,516
Here it is, Mel. $1,000 worth of hair.
What am I supposed to do with it?

735
00:49:57,601 --> 00:50:00,354
- Alan, I was wondering if...
- You want one of them?

736
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:04,278
- I'd rather make a coat for my wife.
- (laugh track)

737
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:07,797
All right, everyone.
It's time to expand your minds.

738
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:13,001
- It's homework time. OK?
- Yeah, but... after Dick Van Dyke.

739
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:16,921
No. Now.

740
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,476
No.

741
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:22,480
We always watch Dick Van Dyke.

742
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:27,599
Really? Well, not any more.

743
00:50:28,961 --> 00:50:32,112
The only thing you'll be watching
is Deep Sea-N-N.

744
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:34,840
Now,...

745
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:38,199
..I know you're used to loosey-goosey.

746
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:41,079
But I run a much tighter ship.

747
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:45,679
Between the hours of 3pm and 7pm,
I'm in charge.

748
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:49,949
And when I'm in charge,
you will follow a schedule.

749
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:52,919
Those who do not follow the schedule
will be punished.

750
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:56,679
- (whispers) Punished?
- She's lying.

751
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:58,752
She'd never punish us.

752
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:01,630
Don't... fuss with me.

753
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:32,353
(vacuum cleaner off)

754
00:51:32,441 --> 00:51:34,750
This is exploitation. It's not fair.

755
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,913
- Shut up, Lydie.
- Yeah. You got us into this.

756
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:40,356
Ooh, my little ankle-biters.

757
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:42,909
Do I sense dissension in the ranks?

758
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:46,550
Are we ready for homework,
or shall we continue manual labour?

759
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:51,317
- No. Anything but this.
- Then upstairs, my little nose-miners.

760
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:54,393
Go. Flee before me!

761
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:56,711
Onward and upward!

762
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:58,917
Go pump some neurons.

763
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:00,992
Expand your craniums.

764
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:03,072
- I miss Dad.
- Me, too.

765
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,595
(Nattie)
Me most.

766
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:09,272
(as Daniel)
I'm here, guys.

767
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,352
In some form.

768
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:17,072
Let's see.

769
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:22,312
OK. Pinch of basil.

770
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:26,112
Oh! Damn!

771
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:34,514
Aaagghh!

772
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,592
Mayday!

773
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:39,192
Oh, God! It's gonna blow!

774
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:43,432
Easy, easy.

775
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,512
Damn. Calm down.

776
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:47,080
Oh... Oh... Come on.

777
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:49,675
Hey, hey, hey. How is it?

778
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:52,434
Oh, my God. It's clotted. Oh, God.

779
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:56,554
This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber.

780
00:52:57,361 --> 00:52:59,431
God, it's hot in here.

781
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:03,196
Aarghh! Aarghh! Aarghh!

782
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,632
Ohh!

783
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:15,152
(coughs)

784
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:18,837
Agh! Look at this!

785
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:21,958
My first day as a woman
and I'm getting hot flashes.

786
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:40,510
- Hey, here's your food.
- How much is it?

787
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:43,718
- 135.27.
- 135 dollars? That's certainly...

788
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,792
- And 27 cents.
- 27 cents...

789
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:48,634
Four dinners. 20 bucks extra for rushing us.

790
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:52,509
Rushing? Well, you could have been
a little bit faster, dear.

791
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:55,911
- There's... 140. Do you have change?
- No.

792
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:58,993
I thought you wouldn't.
Thank you very much.

793
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:09,912
(car pulls up)

794
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,112
Hello!

795
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:33,512
Hello! Anybody home?

796
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:38,839
- Where were you guys?
- Upstairs, doing our homework.

797
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,071
Mrs Doubtfire said we had to.

798
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:43,675
- Oh, she did, huh?
- Mm-hm.

799
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:46,639
Doing your homework. How great!

800
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,439
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

801
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:52,309
Look at this place! It looks wonderful!
All spick-and-span.

802
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:01,390
Wow!

803
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:07,796
Dinner is served, madam.

804
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,359
How lovely!

805
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,592
Mrs Doubtfire?

806
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,276
Lydia, dear. Get back inside
right now before you freeze.

807
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:41,639
Look... I just want to apologise
for being such a pain today.

808
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:45,316
- Oh, dear, it's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

809
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:50,639
It's just... I'm still kind of messed-up...
about everything.

810
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,872
We all are, sweetie.

811
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:57,319
What?

812
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:01,999
I just mean I understand
the pain you're all going through.

813
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:05,912
Yeah.

814
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,837
Well... I also wanted to thank you.

815
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:12,393
- For what?
- For making my mom so happy.

816
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:13,990
Oh.

817
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:19,636
She hasn't been in this good a mood since...
I can't even remember.

818
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:23,832
It's been a long time.

819
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,276
- It has?
- Yeah.

820
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:29,472
Well, I gotta go back in, but...

821
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:32,957
- Go, go, go.
- OK. Thank you.

822
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:35,910
You're welcome.

823
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:40,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,392
(door closes)

825
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,392
Thank you.

826
00:56:59,521 --> 00:57:02,035
(hollow laugh)
Oh, no.

827
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,720
Well, milady! It's a pleasure to see you again!

828
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,792
A joy, as always.

829
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:16,392
(sighs)

830
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:29,876
I like that Mediterranean look in women.

831
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:33,392
Natural. Healthy.

832
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:36,912
Just the way God made ya.

833
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:42,398
He broke the mould when he made me, dear.
He made me very special.

834
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:45,190
He sure did.

835
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,750
Bless you.

837
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:54,959

Dude looks like a lady

843
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:13,990
Never judge a book by its cover

844
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:17,954
Or who you gonna love by your lover

845
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:21,957
Say, love put me wise to her love in disguise

846
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,032
She had the body of a Venus

847
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:26,112
Lord, imagine my surprise

848
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:27,759
Yeah, yeah

849
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,797

Dude looks like a lady

856
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,790
Cruised into a bar on the shore

857
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:50,679
Her picture graced the grime on the door

858
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:54,078
She's a long-lost love at first bite

859
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:58,759
Baby, maybe you're wrong
but you know it's all right

860
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,232
(as Richard Nixon)
I am not a crook. I am not a crook.

861
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:08,630
"She kissed Stuart and thanked him."

862
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:11,713
(male voice) "'How was it down there?'
asked Mr Little,...

863
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:15,191
..who was always curious to know
about places he'd never been to."

864
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:17,112
"'lt was all right,' said Stuart."

865

( "Dude Looks Like a Lady")

866
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:39,076
What a funky lady

867
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:44,110
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it

868
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:46,915
Ooh, he was a lady

869
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:51,678
Yeow

870
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,399
Yeah, yeah

871
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:55,472
Dude looks like a lady

872
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:57,074
Yeah, yeah

873
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,152

Yeah, yeah

875

Dude looks like a lady...

876
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:06,432
(as Daniel)
Back off, asshole!

877
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,159
Beat it!

878
01:00:10,601 --> 01:00:13,434
(as Mrs Doubtfire)
Broke my bag, the bastard.

879
01:00:20,641 --> 01:00:23,201
Lover boy's here.

880
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:26,353
What a beautiful little car for Don Juan.

881
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:32,832
So sad when that happens!

882
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:37,592
It was ourjunior year in college, and your
mother got asked to design this big float.

883
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,758
(Miranda) I wasn't that young.
That's my picture.

884
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:47,038
- (laughter)
- ..flying out everywhere, hit you in the face.

885
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,397
- (Miranda laughing) That's not true!
- It was like 'Jaws'.

886
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:54,269
- Isn't that the pretty picture!
- Oh. Mrs Doubtfire.

887
01:00:54,881 --> 01:00:58,874
Miranda. What a pleasant surprise
to see you home so early, dear.

888
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:01,680
- And who is your gentleman caller?
- This is Stu.

889
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:05,071
- He just wanted to come and meet the kids.
- Oh, did he?

890
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,437
Ah, this must be the famous Mrs Doubtfire.

891
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,712
It's a pleasure to meet you.

892
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:14,434
Yes, well... Miranda's been raving about you.

893
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:17,319
- Odd. She's never mentioned you.
- No?

894
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:20,438
- No.
- Well... It's good to meet you.

895
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:22,512
- You, too.
- Yes.

896
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:27,473
I have a home in London. I was born there.
What part of England are you from?

897
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:31,952
- Here and there, dear. All over, really.
- Yes?

898
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:35,875
- Accent's a little kind of... muddled.
- Really? So is your tan.

899
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:37,997
(Mrs Doubtfire chuckles)

900
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:41,870
Dear, can you help me with something?
I found this outside.

901
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:44,839
Er... yes. This is off my Mercedes.

902
01:01:44,921 --> 01:01:49,312
Off your Mercedes, dear?
You own that big, expensive car out there?

903
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:52,598
Oh, dear. They say a man
who has to buy a big car like that...

904
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:54,956
..is compensating for smaller genitals.

905
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:59,273
But not in your case, cos I see
that you're a strapping lad, aren't ya?

906
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:01,955
- It was lovely to meet you.
- You too, dear.

907
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:06,429
- Mrs Doubtfire, may I speak with you?
- Ooh, certainly, dear.

908
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:09,799
Could you stay
a few extra hours this evening?

909
01:02:09,881 --> 01:02:13,920
Stu. That's more of a thick soup
than a name, really.

910
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:15,992
It's a name. It's short for Stuart.

911
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:19,073
- Is it?
- Yes. He's a client. And a friend.

912
01:02:19,161 --> 01:02:21,675
- He was a friend. He is a friend.
- What is he?

913
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:24,400
- I don't know what's happening.
- What is it, dear?

914
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:27,041
- Isn't he fabulous?
- Oh... kind of, dear,...

915
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,715
..if you like that handsome, rugged type.

916
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:33,157
But personally I prefer short, furry and funny.

917
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:35,630
He just wants to go out and have a drink.

918
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:39,475
- I think that's pretty harmless. Don't you?
- Absolutely not, dear.

919
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:43,031
- They always have other intentions.
- This is business, mostly.

920
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:46,272
I'll just sip club soda
and we'll go over wallpaper samples.

921
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:49,752
Dear Miranda. Wake up
and smell the coffee, dear.

922
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,355
Can't you see the lust in that man's eyes?

923
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:55,239
It's too soon, dear. Really.

924
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:57,516
You've got to give your divorce time.

925
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:02,391
Let your sheets cool down before you bring
someone else into the bed. All right?

926
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:04,915
Mrs Doubtfire, may I ask you a question?

927
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:06,992
Certainly, dear.

928
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,549
How long after Mr Doubtfire passed away...

929
01:03:09,641 --> 01:03:11,359
- Winston.
- Winston.

930
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:13,875
..did you feel any... desire...

931
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:18,999
- Never.
- Never?

932
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:20,912
- Never again.
- Never again?

933
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,710
Once the father of your children
is out of the picture,...

934
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,271
..the only solution is
total and lifelong celibacy.

935
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:30,199
- Celibacy?
- Yes.

936
01:03:30,521 --> 01:03:33,194
And if you violate that, heaven forgive ya.

937
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,278
Good luck.

938
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:39,312
Thank you.

939
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:46,871

Oh, that's very good.
Will you excuse me, dear? Call of nature.

947
01:04:10,761 --> 01:04:13,150
Check those. I'll be right back.

948
01:04:23,921 --> 01:04:25,912
(raises toilet seat)

949
01:04:34,601 --> 01:04:36,717
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God!

950
01:04:37,401 --> 01:04:39,790
- Oh, my God!
- Chris! Wait!

951
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:42,552
Lydia! We gotta call the cops!

952
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:45,109
- We gotta dial 911 now!
- Why?

953
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:48,591
Mrs Doubtfire... He's a she!
She's a she! He's a she-she!

954
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:50,558
-(Lydia) What?
- Uh... Uh...

955
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:53,155
- He's half man, half woman!
- What?

956
01:04:53,721 --> 01:04:57,555
- All right, everyone. Calm down.
- Freeze! Or you're gonna get it!

957
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:59,040
- In the balls!
- Yeah!

958
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:02,275
- She's got 'em?
- She's got everything.

959
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,352
All right. Listen to me.

960
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:06,830
I'm not... who you think I am.

961
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:09,993
- No shit!
- (as Daniel) Watch your mouth, young man!

962
01:05:13,601 --> 01:05:15,592
Oh, my God.

963
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:21,440
- Dad?
- Yeah.

964
01:05:22,321 --> 01:05:24,835
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey.

965
01:05:26,361 --> 01:05:29,000
You don't really like wearin' that,
do you, Dad?

966
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:32,120
Well, some of it's comfortable... No! No.

967
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:36,434
It's a pain in the padded ass.
This is not a way of life. It's just ajob.

968
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:40,556
I don't go to old-lady bars or
anything like that after work.

969
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:43,280
It's the only way
I could see you guys every day.

970
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:47,036
- Who did this?
- Uncle Frank and Aunt Jack.

971
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:49,512
Oh.

972
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,112
It's really you in there.

973
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,192
Yeah.

974
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:04,595
It's just a mask. And this is a body suit.
I didn't have any operations or anything.

975
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:06,717
- It's good.
- Yeah.

976
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:08,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

977
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:13,870
- Sorry I scared you. Come here, Chris.
- No. No, it's OK.

978
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:17,476
I get it. I just...
don't wanna hug you or anything.

979
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:21,231
- Not just yet.
- That's cool. It's a guy thing.

980
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:23,553
Yeah.

981
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:26,713
Well, now that you know,
you can't tell Mom, OK?

982
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:32,999
Cos if she finds out, I'll only be able
to see you through plate glass. OK?

983
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:36,073
And we can't tell Nattie,
cos she'll blow my cover.

984
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:39,233
So you have to promise me,
it's just us. All right?

985
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:41,596
- You promise?
- Yeah.

986
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:45,952
It's OK.

987
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:50,355
All right? It's our little secret.

988
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:58,118
Most of the dinosaurs... were herbivorous.

989
01:06:58,201 --> 01:07:00,715
But this 'Tyrannosaurus rex'...

990
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:03,631
..is a carnivore.

991
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:13,278
The reptile-like... 'Saurischia'...

992
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:16,272
..Saurischia...

993
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:19,080
..and the bird-like...

994
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:20,958
..Ornithischia.

995
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:30,034
Now... we're going to go...

996
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:32,510
..where no human being has ever been.

997
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:34,592
Oh, no.

998
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:38,112
Which one's the dinosaur?

999
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:42,752
- The one in the middle, I think.
- Nah, you're wrong. They're all extinct.

1000
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:48,719
I can't believe they're still
subjecting kids to this. This is insane.

1001
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:53,716
There should be a disclaimer: Do not operate
heavy machinery while watching this show.

1002
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:55,792
It's incredible.

1003
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:59,760
This guy used to put me to sleep
when I was a kid. It's amazing.

1004
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:04,790
He has the warmth of a snow pea. Makes
Mr Rogers look like Mick Jagger. It's insane.

1005
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,837
What kind of idiot
kept this guy on the air for 25 years?

1006
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:10,840
Me.

1007
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,638
You?

1008
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,518
Jonathan Lundy.

1009
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:21,515
Jonathan Lundy, General Manager, owner?

1010
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:24,479
Oh. I'm Daniel Hillard, former employee.

1011
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:26,957
Ah. Maybe.

1012
01:08:28,241 --> 01:08:30,232
That's funny.

1013
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:32,437
I don't mean to criticise. I just...

1014
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:36,230
- Sometimes I have...
- Criticise all you want. Show's terrible.

1015
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:40,519
I'm gonna cancel it. It's pullin' down
the whole afternoon schedule. It's gone.

1016
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,592
You know what you gotta do?

1017
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:45,639
Start from scratch.
Give it... maybe a musical number.

1018
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:50,511
- A little 'Tyrannosaurus rex' comes out...
- Hillard, get your ass to the truck.

1019
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:53,877
That shipment's gotta make
a six o'clock flight to LA.

1020
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,395
Tone, this is Mr Lundy.

1021
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,275
- He knows who I am.
- Yeah.

1022
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:03,559
Did you ever wish that you could
freeze-frame a single moment in your day,...

1023
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:06,155
..look at it and say "This is not my life"?

1024
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:13,755
( "Walk Like a Man" by the Four Seasons)

1025
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:17,712
Walk, walk

1026
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:19,200
He said:

1027
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:22,671
Walk like a man, talk like a man

1028
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:26,357
Walk like a man, my son

1029
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:30,317
No woman's worth crawling on the earth...

1030
01:09:32,321 --> 01:09:34,994
Miranda. What are you home early for, dear?

1031
01:09:35,081 --> 01:09:37,311
I had an appointment. Oh, thank you!

1032
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:40,552
- With the court liaison. Mrs Sellner.
- Oh!

1033
01:09:40,641 --> 01:09:43,030
- I can't believe it.
- What, dear?

1034
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:47,719
She says Daniel has some woman
living with him pretending to be his sister!

1035
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:50,554
- Oh...!
- I told her he doesn't even have a sister.

1036
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,555
Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.

1037
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:58,031
She's a social worker, dear. Really!

1038
01:09:58,121 --> 01:10:01,591
And besides, how could he replace you?

1039
01:10:01,681 --> 01:10:04,115
And so quickly. Really!

1040
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:07,511
She's supposed to be older
and very unattractive.

1041
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,112
Really? Oh.

1042
01:10:11,881 --> 01:10:13,872
Mrs Doubtfire.

1043
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:18,433
- Yes?
- Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever...

1044
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:24,953
- You must have had your share of problems.
- Oh, of course, dear. What marriage doesn't?

1045
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:28,590
But I always say: the bad times fade away,...

1046
01:10:28,681 --> 01:10:31,639
..and the good ones
adhere themselves to your memory.

1047
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:34,315
- Yes. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

1048
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:41,677
Oh... As I hold this cold meat,
I'm reminded of Winston. God rest his soul.

1049
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:44,278
When did he... pass on?

1050
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:48,952
Eight years ago, dear. This November.

1051
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:51,192
What happened?

1052
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,954
- He was quite fond of the drink.
- Ah.

1053
01:10:54,761 --> 01:10:57,229
- It was the drink that killed him.
- How awful.

1054
01:10:57,321 --> 01:11:01,360
- He was an alcoholic?
- No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.

1055
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:04,319
So it was quite literally
the drink that killed him.

1056
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:06,830
- How tragic!
- Yes.

1057
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:13,999
Oh, but he was a good man, though, really.

1058
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:17,796
A sainted man.

1059
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:20,475
And despite his mountains of faults, dear,...

1060
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:23,792
..I always say: a flawed husband
is better than none at all.

1061
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:29,199
- Who needs a husband when I've got you?
- Surely you don't mean that, dear?

1062
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:31,590
- Well...
- Oh, that's so sweet!

1063
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:35,310
You can't imagine what it was like
being married to Daniel.

1064
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:40,031
Tell me, dear. What was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years?

1065
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:42,112
Well, at first, nothing.

1066
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:45,193
He was... He was so... romantic.

1067
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:47,272
- So passionate.
- Really?

1068
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:50,159
He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.

1069
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:53,950
I hope you don't mind me
being a tad rude, but...

1070
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:57,875
..how was he... you know...
on a scale of 1 to 10?

1071
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,192
Oh, well. That part was always...

1072
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:03,473
..OK.

1073
01:12:03,561 --> 01:12:05,756
Just OK? Oh.

1074
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:10,069
He was probably a Casanova
compared to poor old Winston.

1075
01:12:10,161 --> 01:12:12,595
- What was the matter with Winston?
- Oh, dear.

1076
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:16,833
Winston's idea of foreplay was
"Effie, brace yourself."

1077
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,918
It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy
I fell in love with.

1078
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:24,798
Really?

1079
01:12:24,881 --> 01:12:29,272
Everyone else I knew
was so organised, so scheduled.

1080
01:12:29,361 --> 01:12:31,352
Like me, I guess.

1081
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:36,231
But Daniel was so wonderfully different.
And funny. He could always make me laugh.

1082
01:12:36,321 --> 01:12:39,438
I always say:
the key to a solid marriage is laughter.

1083
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:44,276
But after a few years,
everything just stopped being funny.

1084
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:47,910
- Why?
- I was working all the time and...

1085
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:52,040
..he was always between jobs.
I hardly ever got to see the kids, and...

1086
01:12:52,121 --> 01:12:55,875
..if I got home early to be with them,
something would go wrong.

1087
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:59,237
The house would be wrecked
and I'd have to clean it up.

1088
01:13:00,521 --> 01:13:05,037
He never knew, but so many nights I just...
cried myself to sleep.

1089
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:08,558
Really?

1090
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:13,990
The truth is, I didn't like who I was
when I was with him.

1091
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:16,916
I would turn into this horrible person.

1092
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:21,550
I didn't want my kids growing up
with a mother like that.

1093
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:25,230
When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.

1094
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:30,718
And... I'm sure he's better
when he's not with me.

1095
01:13:31,881 --> 01:13:34,315
Well, you never...

1096
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:38,553
I mean... Did you ever
say anything to him, dear?

1097
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,673
Daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious.

1098
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:53,434
I used to think Daniel could do anything...
except be serious.

1099
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:59,516
But then, I was serious enough
for everybody.

1100
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,151
- Oh!
-(Nattie) This is great!

1101
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:25,199
(Mrs Doubtfire)
Isn't this posh!

1102
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:30,594
I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably need
a credit reference just to get in the pool.

1103
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:33,241
- Amazing!
- Oh, Nattie.

1104
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:37,155
Not a single body
that exists in nature. Look at that.

1105
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:39,311
- Lydie...
- There's Stu!

1106
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:41,517
(Mrs Doubtfire)
Where? Oh. On the board.

1107
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:44,675
Oh, isn't he a stunning piece of work?

1108
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:47,798
Look, Nattie. That's called liposuction.

1109
01:14:56,401 --> 01:14:58,392
(Miranda laughs)
Wow!

1110
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:02,076
I hope he had protection,
hitting the water at that speed.

1111
01:15:02,161 --> 01:15:04,914
- Let's go say hi.
- Let's do, please.

1112
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,561
- Wow! That's amazing.
- Stunning.

1113
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:17,471
- Hello! You look lovely!
- Hi.

1114
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,916
Oh, guys, I'm so glad you could make it.

1115
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:23,835
- By the looks of you, that water's so cold!
- Yes, well...

1116
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:26,754
Your tummy looks different from my daddy's.

1117
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:31,952
Oh, Nattie! Not everyone has
their own personal trainer.

1118
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:35,871
- Got your swimsuits? Wanna go for a dip?
- That'd be great!

1119
01:15:36,121 --> 01:15:39,875
- Good! How about you, Mrs Doubtfire?
- Oh, you wicked, wicked man!

1120
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:43,158
Isn't there enough flesh here
for you to feast your eyes on?

1121
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:47,553
- Come, Mrs Doubtfire. Don't be bashful.
- No, dear. They've outlawed whaling.

1122
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:50,872
- We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.
- Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.

1123
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:54,636
Oh, no. Just go. Leave me here.
I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.

1124
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:57,394
You can't get heatstroke
twice in the same year.

1125
01:15:57,481 --> 01:16:00,200
OK. Well, let's go, kids. Swim time.

1126
01:16:00,481 --> 01:16:03,553
- Go, dear. I'll be fine.
- Your day's on me, Mrs Doubtfire.

1127
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:06,474
- Anything you need, put it on my tab.
- Thank you, dear.

1128
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:09,792
Touch me again and
I'll drown you, you bastard.

1129
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:13,430
I'll just sit here and watch you
move in on my family.

1130
01:16:13,521 --> 01:16:15,318
Hello, hello.

1131
01:16:18,121 --> 01:16:22,273
Oh, God. What am I doing here?
This is beyond obsession.

1132
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,874
Oh, God...

1133
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:26,111
( steel band plays "Yellow Bird")

1134
01:16:32,401 --> 01:16:33,595
(belches)

1135
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:52,875
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- (drunkenly) Fan-bloody-tastic.

1136
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:54,474
- Can I have another?
- Sure.

1137
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:55,550
Great.

1138
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:06,992
- Hi.
- Soda with a lime, please.

1139
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:19,670
- It's on me.
- No, thanks.

1140
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,472
Four iced teas, Todd.

1141
01:17:31,441 --> 01:17:33,432
So, whose rugrats?

1142
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:37,839
Miranda Hillard's.

1143
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:40,958
- Miranda Hillard?
- Mm-hm. The woman I'm seeing.

1144
01:17:41,801 --> 01:17:44,634
No kidding? You?
The guy who's never having kids?

1145
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:48,919
Won't have anything to do with kids?
You won't even date a woman with kids.

1146
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:50,992
People change, Ron.

1147
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:54,756
I'm pushing 40. I don't want to
spend the rest of my life by myself.

1148
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:57,150
She's got an awful lot of baggage. Three kids.

1149
01:17:57,241 --> 01:18:01,951
Three terrific kids, and I'm crazy about them.
Especially little Natalie. Look at her.

1150
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:04,157
She's a sweetie pie.

1151
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:09,272
God knows they need a stable father figure
in their life right now.

1152
01:18:09,361 --> 01:18:14,481
- What about their real father?
- What can I say? The guy's a loser. I'll see ya.

1153
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,955
(to himself)
Loser? Oh, yeah?

1154
01:18:22,801 --> 01:18:24,792
Oh, sir!

1155
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:29,033
I saw it! Some angry member
of the kitchen staff. Did you not tip them?

1156
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,830
Oh, the terrorists! They ran that way.
It was a run-by fruiting.

1157
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:35,310
I'll get them, sir. Don't worry.

1158
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:38,432
(angry grunt)

1159
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:41,437
Oh... Oh...

1160
01:18:42,521 --> 01:18:44,512
Good waste ofjuice.

1161
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:46,273
(as Daniel)
Loser.

1162
01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:50,591
(as Daniel)
What are you lookin' at?

1163
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:10,355
(whistles tentatively)

1164
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:22,912
(as Mr Rogers)
Hi, boys and girls.

1165
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:26,152
Today we'll be talking about dinosaurs.

1166
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:29,358
(as announcer)
It's... A Dinosaurus Line!

1167
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:32,751
( hums brassy intro)

1168
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:35,230
And please welcome... the king!

1169
01:19:35,321 --> 01:19:37,437
( hums show tune)

1170
01:19:39,281 --> 01:19:42,830
It's a dinner show. Hi! Where you from?
I'm gonna make you lunch.

1171
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:45,196
- (as Elvis) Thank you very much.
- Thank you! All right!

1172
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your claws together!

1173
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:52,513
Please welcome... James Browntosaurus!

1174
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:54,353
( hums intro to "I Feel Good")

1175
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:56,352
 I eat wood, di-na di-na di-na din

1176
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:58,996
 It tastes good, di-na di-na di-na din

1177
01:19:59,521 --> 01:20:01,671
 No meat, big feet

1178
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:04,434
 I eat wood - pum pum pum pum! Ow!

1179
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:08,230
Oh, I got to help myself!
Can't go on! I'm goin' extinct!

1180
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:13,679
Oh, thank you, James. But right now - yo!
It's time for the Raptor Rap!

1181
01:20:13,761 --> 01:20:16,514
 I'm a raptor, doin' what I can

1182
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:19,638
 Gonna eat everything
till the appearance of man

1183
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:22,993
 Yo, yo, see me, I'm livin' below the soil

1184
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:25,993
 I'll be back but I'm comin' as oil

1185
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:31,715
Very impressive, Mr Hillard!

1186
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:36,317
- I didn't know anybody was watching.
- I was watching. That's funny stuff.

1187
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:39,359
- Well, thanks.
- I think kids'd like it.

1188
01:20:39,441 --> 01:20:43,559
- They'd be entertained and get information.
- That's kinda my theory.

1189
01:20:43,641 --> 01:20:46,439
You don't have to play down to 'em,
just play to 'em.

1190
01:20:46,521 --> 01:20:50,036
- Listen, I'd like to hear more of your ideas.
- My ideas?

1191
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:53,557
- How about a dinner meeting?
- Wow. OK.

1192
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,678
Next Friday. Bridges Restaurant.
Seven o'clock sharp.

1193
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:00,072
I'll be there.

1194
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,753
Take five.

1195
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:09,753
Take five million. You're dead.

1196
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:17,791
(Daniel) We've just had our first
home-cooked meal. I'm domestic now, huh?

1197
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:21,510
- (Chris) This is terrific, Dad.
- You want more spaghetti?

1198
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:24,274
- No, I'm stuffed.
- Garlic bread? I made it myself.

1199
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:27,512
Well, I didn't make it myself.
I cooked it. I sliced it.

1200
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:30,035
It's OK, Dad. Thanks.

1201
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:32,840
The place looks great. The food's terrific.

1202
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:36,320
I'm really proud of you.

1203
01:21:36,401 --> 01:21:37,834
Yeah. Me, too.

1204
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:40,355
Me, too.

1205
01:21:40,841 --> 01:21:42,513
(knocking on door)

1206
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:45,277
I'll be right back.

1207
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:53,075
- Thank you for knocking.
- Yeah.

1208
01:21:53,961 --> 01:21:56,521
Whoa! Look at this!

1209
01:21:57,521 --> 01:21:59,830
I see you got someone to clean for you.

1210
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,912
- No.
- You...?

1211
01:22:03,641 --> 01:22:06,030
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

1212
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:09,114
- Are they ready?
- No. They haven't had dessert yet.

1213
01:22:09,201 --> 01:22:12,238
- You cooked?
- Yes. I cook, I bake, I sew.

1214
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:15,593
Thanks to this Amish
home study course I'm doing.

1215
01:22:15,961 --> 01:22:18,350
- I'm very impressed.
- Really?

1216
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:22,116
Give me a second chance. OK?
Let me take the kids after school.

1217
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:26,430
- I can't get rid of Mrs Doubtfire. She's terrific.
- Why not?

1218
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:28,989
She's the best thing that ever happened to us.

1219
01:22:29,081 --> 01:22:33,791
The kids are all doing better in school.
Chris is passing every single subject.

1220
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:38,432
I find myself getting home early
just to be with them. We're all doing so great.

1221
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:43,200
Whooh! Sounds like an amazing woman.
Too good to be true.

1222
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:45,351
She is.

1223
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,269
- I kinda like the black one.
- Me, too.

1224
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:58,110
I don't know. Actually... Mrs Doubtfire!

1225
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:00,351
- Yes?
- We need another woman's opinion.

1226
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:02,432
Oh! Then I'm your woman.

1227
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:05,115
- Which one?
- What's the occasion?

1228
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:07,795
- It's my birthday.
- Oh!

1229
01:23:07,881 --> 01:23:10,475
- Stu's taking me out to dinner.
- Oh...

1230
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,152
- Neither.
- Neither?

1231
01:23:14,241 --> 01:23:17,119
They're both too brazen, dear.
They cry "harlot".

1232
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,840
Red is the traditional colour for streetwalkers.

1233
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:23,800
And the black one is far too short.
I hope you waxed.

1234
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:25,599
They both say to me "I'm easy."

1235
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:29,754
You want to be Kilimanjaro
on your first date - inaccessible.

1236
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:32,594
Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

1237
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:35,991
No, let's find something more your own age.

1238
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:38,072
Something a little less tawdry.

1239
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:40,832
Let's see.

1240
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:44,357
How about this lovely frock?
Tasteful, elegant...

1241
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,352
Don't you think?

1242
01:23:46,441 --> 01:23:49,877
And old. I wore that
to my aunt's funeral in 1976.

1243
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:53,192
A classic never dies, dear.
I think it's time to revive it.

1244
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:56,114
I think we should ask the kids.
What do you think?

1245
01:23:56,201 --> 01:24:00,638
- I'd go with the short, black one.
- Yeah. It's the most fun.

1246
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:03,432
There. You see? I agree.

1247
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:06,831
Fine. You ask my opinion, then don't take it.

1248
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:11,392
- I will not be held responsible for your virtue.
- You'll be there to protect me.

1249
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:16,601
- Stu has invited you and the kids to join us.
- Oh, how lovely! One big, happy family.

1250
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:20,276
I wouldn't miss that for the world!
Should be smashing good fun!

1251
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:23,797
- I'm so glad.
- When is this enchanted evening?

1252
01:24:23,881 --> 01:24:26,600
Friday night, seven o'clock.

1253
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:30,390
- This Friday at seven?
- Yes. At my favourite restaurant. Bridges.

1254
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:33,472
- Bridges?
- Yes.

1255
01:24:33,561 --> 01:24:35,597
- Friday at seven.
- Bridges.

1256
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:37,672
Sorry.

1257
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:40,672
- Bridges?
- Yes! Bridges.

1258
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:43,878
- The restaurant Bridges?
- Friday at seven.

1259
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:48,755
- I can't. Please, don't. It's bingo night, dear.
- Cancel it.

1260
01:24:48,841 --> 01:24:52,197
I can't, dear. It's my turn
to pull the balls at the rectory.

1261
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:54,636
- Please join us.
- Don't ask me that, dear.

1262
01:24:54,721 --> 01:24:56,712
I can't have my birthday without you.

1263
01:24:56,801 --> 01:25:00,760
It's so important to us that you be there.
You're part of the family now.

1264
01:25:00,841 --> 01:25:05,551
I can't have a birthday without you. It would
mean so much to me and the children.

1265
01:25:05,641 --> 01:25:09,873
Please promise you'll come with us,
Mrs Doubtfire. You just have to.

1266
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:13,950
Who could resist that little face?

1267
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:17,790
- I promise.
- Thank you!

1268
01:25:18,561 --> 01:25:20,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you, dear.

1269
01:25:20,961 --> 01:25:23,521
- Oh! Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1270
01:25:23,601 --> 01:25:25,592
(woman)
Let's see... Nothing.

1271
01:25:25,681 --> 01:25:27,797
- (Daniel) Anything in May?
- Not a thing.

1272
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:29,872
It doesn't look good.

1273
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:33,991
I'm sorry. Mr Lundy is completely booked
for the next two months.

1274
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:38,116
- I'll meet him any time, anywhere.
- Sorry. There's nothing I can do.

1275
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:40,999
Please. I can't cancel.
It's a huge opportunity.

1276
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:44,118
Take my advice: don't cancel.

1277
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:49,436
Thank you.

1278
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:06,279
- (Mrs Doubtfire) Come along, Nattie.
- Hello, darling!

1279
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,559
- Shouldn't you cover your shoulders?
- No! I'm fine.

1280
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:12,030
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- Good evening.

1281
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:15,796
(to himself)
Oh, God. Here we go.

1282
01:26:15,881 --> 01:26:18,475
- Mrs Doubtfire, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1283
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:20,552
Come on. I hope you're all hungry.

1284
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:28,358
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- I'm meeting someone. Is he here?

1285
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:31,192
No, I'm sorry. He hasn't arrived yet.

1286
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:33,954
But we can seat you.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

1287
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:36,430
- Nonsmoking, please.
- Nonsmoking...

1288
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:40,355
- Tanya will seat you. Table 15.
- This way, please.

1289
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:44,399
- Reservation. Dunmeyer.
- Yes, sir.

1290
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,111
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

1291
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,954
- Smoking!
- Mrs Doubtfire, you don't smoke.

1292
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:52,396
No, I don't. But I did.

1293
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:57,316
I found the best way to keep from smoking
again is to be around those who do smoke.

1294
01:26:57,401 --> 01:27:01,917
I have to randomly ingest just a little bit
of nicotine and it steels my wool.

1295
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:05,880
And I know you're Mr Health. Bless you
for putting yourself in harm's way.

1296
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:09,510
- Smoking.
- All right. Table 39.

1297
01:27:09,601 --> 01:27:12,638
- Follow me, please.
- 39! My age! You're a saint.

1298
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:16,159
Thank you very much
for humouring an old lady.

1299
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:28,432
- (Daniel to himself) He's pissed already.
- Mrs Doubtfire?

1300
01:27:29,521 --> 01:27:33,719
- Would you... like to join us?
- Ooh. I thought I saw Clint Eastwood.

1301
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:37,316
That would make my day!
He is such a stud-muffin.

1302
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:40,359
Will you excuse me, dear?
I have to check my wrap.

1303
01:27:40,441 --> 01:27:43,956
- Oh, I can do it for you.
- Oh, no, please. I'm quite capable of...

1304
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:47,192
All right, dear. There you go.

1305
01:27:47,281 --> 01:27:49,954
- Oh, and your bag too, ma'am.
- Drop it!

1306
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:52,919
Oh, I'm very sorry, dear. It's my medicine.

1307
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:56,277
- I have to go take my medicine now.
- We have water at the table.

1308
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:59,956
I can't take it orally, dear. I'll be right back.

1309
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:04,273
- (Stu) Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, yes. A good stiff Chardonnay.

1310
01:28:04,361 --> 01:28:06,431
I like 'em light and woody.

1311
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:14,512
(phone rings)

1312
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:19,635
- Hello. Bridges Restaurant. May I help you?
- Yes. My name is Daniel Hillard.

1313
01:28:19,721 --> 01:28:25,193
Mr Lundy is expecting me for dinner. Will you
tell him I'm running late, but I'm on my way?

1314
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:28,796
- I'll deliver the message personally, sir.
- Thank you.

1315
01:28:34,441 --> 01:28:36,238
(Miranda gasps)
Oh!

1316
01:28:36,881 --> 01:28:38,997
Oh, Stu!

1317
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,878
- Wow!
- It's beautiful.

1318
01:28:40,961 --> 01:28:43,600
It's gorgeous! Thank you!

1319
01:28:43,681 --> 01:28:46,354
Oooh! Did I miss anything?

1320
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:51,109
Well, yes. Look. This is the gift
that Stu gave me for my birthday.

1321
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:52,839
Ohhhh!

1322
01:28:52,921 --> 01:28:54,912
- Isn't it gorgeous!
- Is it real?

1323
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:56,992
It is very real, Mrs Doubtfire.

1324
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:02,030
You can either wear that or feed a small
country. That's so nice. So decadent.

1325
01:29:02,121 --> 01:29:04,112
Mommy, I need to go.

1326
01:29:05,681 --> 01:29:08,479
- Mrs Doubtfire, would you take her?
- No. You.

1327
01:29:08,921 --> 01:29:12,152
- She wants you, dear.
- Well... I'll be right back.

1328
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:13,356
OK.

1329
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:20,032
Yes, well...

1330
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:23,557
Children, look at that lovely
dessert tray over there.

1331
01:29:23,641 --> 01:29:27,953
Why don't you go over and pick
what you'd like now so they could reserve it?

1332
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:30,032
- We'll be back.
- All right.

1333
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:34,913
That's a pretty impressive bauble you got her.

1334
01:29:35,001 --> 01:29:36,992
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1335
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:41,552
A fella gives a gift like that,
he wants more than a piece of her heart, eh?

1336
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:44,030
Bit of a going-down payment, huh?

1337
01:29:44,121 --> 01:29:47,636
- Excuse me?
- You know, dear. Sink the sub.

1338
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:49,951
Hide the weasel? Park the porpoise?

1339
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,952
Bit of the old humpty dumpty?

1340
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:55,511
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
Am I being a little graphic? Sorry.

1341
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:58,798
- I hope you're up for a little competition.
- I beg your pardon?

1342
01:29:58,881 --> 01:30:04,353
She's got a power tool in the bedroom, dear.
It's her personal jackhammer.

1343
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,751
She uses it and the lights dim.
It's like a prison movie.

1344
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:10,833
Amazed she hasn't chipped her teeth. Ooh!

1345
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,432
I hope you bring cocktail sauce.

1346
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:18,120
She's got crabs.
And I don't mean Dungeness.

1347
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:21,475
I'm being blunt as a spoon, aren't I?

1348
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,992
Forgive me. Oh...!

1349
01:30:29,201 --> 01:30:31,920
It's the wine. Oh, gosh!

1350
01:30:32,001 --> 01:30:35,357
Be back in a flash. All right? My tiny bladder.

1351
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,032
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- What?

1352
01:30:41,321 --> 01:30:45,030
- You're going into the men's room.
- No! Oh, so it is!

1353
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:48,750
I do need new glasses, dear. Sorry!

1354
01:30:51,521 --> 01:30:53,512
Hello!

1355
01:31:20,921 --> 01:31:21,717
Aagh!

1356
01:31:21,801 --> 01:31:23,598
Jesus! God!

1357
01:31:35,361 --> 01:31:38,273
- Excuse me. May I have a menu?
- Of course.

1358
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,594
- What's France like?
- (Stu) Very beautiful.

1359
01:31:46,561 --> 01:31:48,552
Thank you very much.

1360
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:51,553
- Mr Lundy.
- Oh, hi.

1361
01:31:51,641 --> 01:31:55,077
- Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message?
- Yes. Sit down.

1362
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:58,198
- How about a drink?
- Sure. I'll have what he's having.

1363
01:31:58,281 --> 01:32:00,192
Double Chivas on the rocks.

1364
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,557
Bring him two doubles so he can catch up.

1365
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:08,635
- A Scotch drinker, huh? That's my kinda guy!
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

1366
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:17,996
- OK, everybody. Are we ready to order?
- Yes, I believe we are. Children, fire away.

1367
01:32:18,081 --> 01:32:20,390
Shouldn't we wait for Mrs Doubtfire?

1368
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:23,392
Yes.

1369
01:32:24,361 --> 01:32:25,589
OK.

1370
01:32:29,521 --> 01:32:31,239
- Ah!
- Ah!

1371
01:32:31,321 --> 01:32:33,312
- Ahaha!
- Ahaha!

1372
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:35,437
- (waiter) How are we doin'?
- No, no.

1373
01:32:35,521 --> 01:32:37,512
Oh, yes. Come on.

1374
01:32:39,841 --> 01:32:41,832
All right.

1375
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:44,752
Now...

1376
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:48,480
What can you do
to help the ratings on the kid show?

1377
01:32:48,561 --> 01:32:52,031
Bottom line: don't patronise kids.
They're little people.

1378
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:57,070
You gotta personalise it. Make it fun.
If it's something you'd enjoy, they'd enjoy it.

1379
01:32:57,161 --> 01:32:59,629
- That's what I'm interested in.
- Bingo!

1380
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:02,599
Well, I wonder what's happened
to Mrs Doubtfire.

1381
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:06,390
- We could cross over to the news.
- Would you excuse me for a moment?

1382
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:08,073
But...

1383
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:40,676
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Yes, dear. Thank you very much.

1384
01:33:42,081 --> 01:33:43,833
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

1385
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:47,118
I'm so sorry! It's my fault.

1386
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:52,313
- Forgive me. Excuse me.
- I'm all right. There we go.

1387
01:33:52,401 --> 01:33:54,631
Thank you. Oh, let's see here!

1388
01:33:54,721 --> 01:33:56,712
- May I take your order, ma'am?
- Oh, yes.

1389
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:59,269
Wooh!
(giggles drunkenly)

1390
01:33:59,361 --> 01:34:01,556
Let's see. I'll have the...

1391
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:03,711
..poached salmon.

1392
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:06,315
- And you, sir?
- I'll have the jambalaya.

1393
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:10,394
- Make mine not spicy. I'm allergic to pepper.
- Certainly, sir.

1394
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:12,472
Thank you. Cheers. Your health.

1395
01:34:20,281 --> 01:34:22,158
Oop.

1396
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:24,872
Oh, my God.

1397
01:34:24,961 --> 01:34:28,954
(lisps) So sorry about that.
Just one moment.

1398
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:31,032
Carpe dentum
- seize the teeth.

1399
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:32,952
Let me assist you.

1400
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,670
A spoon. Oh, how clever. Wait. I've got it.

1401
01:34:36,761 --> 01:34:38,911
Wait. There, there. Make a pincer.

1402
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:41,913
Come at it from both sides.
Together - up, up, up.

1403
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:44,720
Oh... Oh! Thank you. There it is.

1404
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:48,836
Just shake them off, like a dog.

1405
01:34:48,921 --> 01:34:50,912
Sorry. Oh, forgive me.

1406
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:53,754
- That's all right.
- Sorry about my spray.

1407
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:58,960
I'll be right back. I just have to
re-attach them with a little adhesive.

1408
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:02,351
- Tell him to puré'e the salmon, if you will.
- Puré'e the salmon.

1409
01:35:02,441 --> 01:35:04,830
Thank you. Sorry about that.

1410
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:13,158
Oh, that one.

1411
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:21,589
Oh. I didn't know there was
someone else in here. Sorry.

1412
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:27,670
(ripping)

1413
01:35:27,761 --> 01:35:30,355
Damn it! Oh, there it is. Urgh!

1414
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:34,832
Excuse me.

1415
01:35:55,361 --> 01:35:59,354
(drunkenly) Where the hell have you been?
I ordered you another Scotch.

1416
01:35:59,441 --> 01:36:01,272
- Bully!
- (laughs)

1417
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:08,277
- Daniel?
- Hm?

1418
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:10,912
Are you wearing ladies' perfume?

1419
01:36:13,481 --> 01:36:15,472
Yes, I am.

1420
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:20,395
Are you wearing lipstick?

1421
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:23,520
Yeah.

1422
01:36:24,601 --> 01:36:26,592
Why?

1423
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:29,998
- It rubbed off.
- From whom?

1424
01:36:31,921 --> 01:36:34,230
A girl I used to date. She's a waitress.

1425
01:36:34,561 --> 01:36:36,552
- A waitress? Here?
- Oh, yeah.

1426
01:36:37,321 --> 01:36:41,473
On the way to the bathroom...
Couldn't keep her hands off me.

1427
01:36:41,561 --> 01:36:43,552
(both snigger)

1428
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:46,838
- You dog!
- You scallywag!

1429
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:49,834
Hey, hey.

1430
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:54,396
I got the stretch outside.
Does your girlfriend have a girlfriend?

1431
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:57,075
- Hey, it's the '90s.
- No, no! I mean...

1432
01:36:58,121 --> 01:37:00,715
Does she have a lady friend for me?

1433
01:37:00,961 --> 01:37:02,952
- Go ahead. Ask her.
- I'll go ask her.

1434
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:06,238
Go on. Come on, go get 'em!

1435
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,838
Hey, Dan! Dan!

1436
01:37:14,921 --> 01:37:16,912
I need my order for table 39!

1437
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:20,152
- Relax. I'll be out in a minute.
- Thank you! Great.

1438
01:37:23,681 --> 01:37:25,876
(chuckles)

1439
01:37:25,961 --> 01:37:28,270
39.
(chuckles)

1440
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:41,272
Table 39!

1441
01:37:56,961 --> 01:37:58,599
Hot jambalaya!

1442
01:38:10,121 --> 01:38:12,430
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Sorry I'm late.

1443
01:38:12,521 --> 01:38:16,514
But after all those Scotches
I had to piss like a racehorse.

1444
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:20,472
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

1445
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:25,317
Why in God's name
are you dressed like a woman?

1446
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:32,112
Oh, damn.

1447
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:40,272
Well...

1448
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:45,679
I'd like you to meet
the host of your new show.

1449
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,917
Host?

1450
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:54,270
Euphegenia Doubtfire, dear. I specialise in
the education and entertainment of children.

1451
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:58,632
(as Daniel)
Surprise!

1452
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,392
(Stu)
Oh, thank you very much.

1453
01:39:03,481 --> 01:39:06,314
- This looks terrific.
- Where's Mrs Doubtfire?

1454
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:08,551
Well, I hope the dear lady's all right.

1455
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:12,350
- Shall we start?
- Yes. Let's start. I don't want it to get cold.

1456
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:14,238
Bon appétit.

1457
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:17,713
Tell me. Why would Mrs Doubtfire
be a good host?

1458
01:39:17,801 --> 01:39:22,636
(rapping) I'm a hip old granny who could
hip-hop, bebop, dance till ya drop,...

1459
01:39:22,721 --> 01:39:25,713
..and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.

1460
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:37,712
(gags and coughs)

1461
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:42,120
Stu? Stu...

1462
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:46,113
Oh, he's choking. He's choking!

1463
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:49,398
Help us! Somebody help!
He's choking! Help us!

1464
01:39:49,481 --> 01:39:51,597
(Miranda)
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1465
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:55,276
- He's choking here! Call 911!
- Oh, no. I killed the bastard.

1466
01:39:55,361 --> 01:39:59,240
- Mrs Doubtfire! Help us! He's choking!
- Help is on the way, dear!

1467
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:02,233
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- Help is on the way!

1468
01:40:02,321 --> 01:40:05,233
- Mrs Doubtfire, he's choking!
- Hold on, dear.

1469
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:11,871
One more time, dear. Work with me!

1470
01:40:11,961 --> 01:40:14,191
(as Daniel)
Come on! Come on!

1471
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,516
(Daniel grunts)

1472
01:40:19,521 --> 01:40:21,637
Come on!
(grunts)

1473
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:23,393
Aaarghhh!

1474
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:29,240
(coughs)

1475
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:32,871
(gasps)
I'm all right.

1476
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,917
- (as Daniel) Are you all right?
- Yes.

1477
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:38,390
Almost lost ya.

1478
01:40:42,441 --> 01:40:43,920
Oh, Dad.

1479
01:40:44,561 --> 01:40:46,040
Oh, my...

1480
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:50,316
Daddy?

1481
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,877
Yeah, honey. It's me.

1482
01:40:56,961 --> 01:40:58,519
(gasps)

1483
01:40:59,121 --> 01:41:02,113
- Happy birthday.
- (yelps)

1484
01:41:03,321 --> 01:41:04,674
Daniel...

1485
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:06,831
Daniel! Oh, my God!

1486
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:09,800
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1487
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:11,872
The whole time... The whole time...

1488
01:41:11,961 --> 01:41:14,429
- The whole time?
- I'm sorry, Miranda. Please?

1489
01:41:14,521 --> 01:41:18,116
Don't talk to me! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

1490
01:41:18,201 --> 01:41:21,238
I have to go. We have to leave now.
I have to leave!

1491
01:41:21,321 --> 01:41:24,040
We have to leave now!
I have to go! We're going.

1492
01:41:26,921 --> 01:41:29,071
- You guys go.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

1493
01:41:29,361 --> 01:41:31,113
(sighs)
Bye.

1494
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:35,312
Sorry about the pepper. I was...

1495
01:41:37,481 --> 01:41:39,472
(Stu clears his throat)

1496
01:41:46,401 --> 01:41:48,710
What are you lookin' at? Show's over.

1497
01:41:54,401 --> 01:41:58,155
(judge) Miss Robeson,
do you have any closing remarks?

1498
01:41:58,241 --> 01:42:00,232
Nothing further, Your Honour.

1499
01:42:01,041 --> 01:42:05,273
Mr Hillard, since you've determined
to act as your own attorney,...

1500
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,990
..you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time.

1501
01:42:18,601 --> 01:42:23,391
Your Honour, in the past two months,
I've secured a residence, refurbished it...

1502
01:42:23,481 --> 01:42:27,269
..and made it "an environment
fit for children". Those are your words.

1503
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:32,915
I'm also holding down ajob as a shipping
clerk. So I believe I met your requirements.

1504
01:42:33,001 --> 01:42:34,992
Ahead of schedule.

1505
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:38,390
In regards to my behaviour...

1506
01:42:38,481 --> 01:42:40,472
..I can only plead insanity.

1507
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:43,075
Because, ever since my children were born,...

1508
01:42:43,161 --> 01:42:46,312
..the moment I looked at them,
I was crazy about them.

1509
01:42:46,401 --> 01:42:48,790
Once I held them, I was hooked.

1510
01:42:50,161 --> 01:42:52,152
I'm addicted to my children, sir.

1511
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:54,992
I love them with all my heart.

1512
01:42:55,081 --> 01:42:59,996
And the idea of someone telling me I can't
be with them, I can't see them every day...

1513
01:43:00,081 --> 01:43:02,675
It's like someone saying I can't have air.

1514
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:06,151
I can't live without air,
and I can't live without them.

1515
01:43:06,601 --> 01:43:12,039
Listen, I would do anything. I just want
to be with them. I know I need that, sir.

1516
01:43:12,401 --> 01:43:14,790
We have a history.

1517
01:43:15,681 --> 01:43:20,709
And I just... They mean everything to me.
And they need me as much as I need them.

1518
01:43:22,881 --> 01:43:24,394
So, please,...

1519
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:26,676
..don't take my kids away from me.

1520
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:29,680
(sighs)

1521
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:34,192
Thank you.

1522
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:45,232
Mr Hillard...

1523
01:43:45,321 --> 01:43:50,349
You've been able to fool a lot of people into
believing that you're a 60-year-old woman.

1524
01:43:51,081 --> 01:43:53,072
No easy task.

1525
01:43:53,161 --> 01:43:59,111
And your little speech seemed to be...
very heartfelt and genuine.

1526
01:44:01,561 --> 01:44:07,716
But I believe it to be a terrific performance
by a very gifted actor. Nothing more.

1527
01:44:07,801 --> 01:44:11,157
- No. It's not that.
- The reality, Mr Hillard,...

1528
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:16,431
..is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox.

1529
01:44:16,921 --> 01:44:20,391
And I refuse to further subject
three innocent children...

1530
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:24,599
..to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behaviour.

1531
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:28,230
It is this court's decision
to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.

1532
01:44:28,321 --> 01:44:29,595
Oh, God, no.

1533
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:33,071
You will have supervised
visitation rights every Saturday.

1534
01:44:33,161 --> 01:44:34,640
Supervised, sir?

1535
01:44:34,721 --> 01:44:38,760
A court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children.

1536
01:44:38,841 --> 01:44:44,074
I am suggesting a period of psychological
testing and perhaps treatment for you.

1537
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:48,716
We will re-examine this case
one year from now.

1538
01:44:48,801 --> 01:44:51,793
Thank you. Court is adjourned.
(bangs gavel)

1539
01:45:04,801 --> 01:45:07,918
I don't do laundry.
I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.

1540
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:11,789
I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.
And I don't do diapers.

1541
01:45:11,881 --> 01:45:14,714
My children have been potty-trained
for some time.

1542
01:45:14,801 --> 01:45:17,395
Well, I don't do washing.
I don't do basements.

1543
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:20,632
I don't do dinners. I don't do reading.

1544
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:23,473
Ah.

1545
01:45:23,881 --> 01:45:27,760
Yes. Well, we have your number.
Thank you so much for coming.

1546
01:45:27,841 --> 01:45:30,309
- We'll be getting back to you.
- Thank you.

1547
01:45:30,401 --> 01:45:32,392
I'll show you to the door.

1548
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:37,834
Yes, here we are. Please...

1549
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:46,358
Laura, that shipment
has been delayed three times.

1550
01:45:46,441 --> 01:45:48,193
Yes, but...

1551
01:45:48,281 --> 01:45:51,478
Laura, I'm not gonna wait
another six months for it.

1552
01:45:51,561 --> 01:45:53,552
You do that. Call me back.

1553
01:45:55,721 --> 01:45:58,713
Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.

1554
01:45:59,001 --> 01:46:01,071
Everything's gonna be all right.

1555
01:46:01,161 --> 01:46:04,073
- I miss her spaghetti.
- I miss herjokes.

1556
01:46:04,601 --> 01:46:06,398
I miss her stories.

1557
01:46:07,001 --> 01:46:10,994
Don't worry. We will find someone.
There are plenty of people out there.

1558
01:46:11,081 --> 01:46:12,958
Nobody like her.

1559
01:46:14,681 --> 01:46:19,232
All right. I admit things were a lot nicer
when she was around.

1560
01:46:19,321 --> 01:46:24,315
The house was so warm and cosy, the beds
were always made, and the dinner was...

1561
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:29,031
She isn't real! We have to stop referring to her
as if she were a real person.

1562
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:31,919
(Mrs Doubtfire's voice) Hello, my dears!

1563
01:46:33,001 --> 01:46:35,561
We have a wonderful show today.

1564
01:46:35,641 --> 01:46:38,599
We have Mr Van Zandt from the Sierra Club,...

1565
01:46:38,681 --> 01:46:42,833
..and he's going to bring some animals
that are endangered species.

1566
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:46,436
- Do you know what that means, poppets?
- Did you say "puppet"?

1567
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:50,116
Oh, no, dear! It's Kovacs! Welcome, Kovacs!

1568
01:46:50,201 --> 01:46:53,398
Hi, guys. Did you say "extinction"?
Does something stink?

1569
01:46:53,481 --> 01:46:59,033
It's not something smelling bad. Extinction
means there's no more of a particular animal.

1570
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:01,715
- Oh, my God.
- Doesn't that make you a little mad?

1571
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:03,757
- Very mad!
- Tell people about it.

1572
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:08,596
I'm mad! You know why? Because next,
it's the chimps! There are fewer chimps...

1573
01:47:08,681 --> 01:47:12,117
Doesn't it make you mad that
humans play your parts in movies?

1574
01:47:12,201 --> 01:47:17,992
Ooh! "Planet of the Apes": who gets the role?
Roddy McDowall! I'd be better than that!

1575
01:47:18,081 --> 01:47:22,120
- I'd be better than Charlton Heston!
- And your rug is better, too.

1576
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:25,079
You could fly to Persia on that rug.

1577
01:47:37,761 --> 01:47:41,356
- Shall we tell them where we'll be tomorrow?
- Yeah. They wanna know.

1578
01:47:41,441 --> 01:47:44,353
Tomorrow, poppets,
we're taking a wonderful trip.

1579
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:47,831
But you don't have to pack
because we're going in our mind.

1580
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:50,481
We're going across the Atlantic Ocean...

1581
01:47:50,561 --> 01:47:52,836
..to England, where I came from.

1582
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:55,640
- You came from England?
- It's a wonderful country.

1583
01:47:55,721 --> 01:47:58,110
- Do you know about England?
- It's an island.

1584
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:00,510
It's an island, dear. A glorious one.

1585
01:48:00,601 --> 01:48:04,958
- They have a queen and a royal family.
- Oh! Just like a poker game!

1586
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:08,078
- It's a full house.
- Some cards don't live at home any more.

1587
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:10,197
Thanks to mobile phones.

1588
01:48:11,001 --> 01:48:13,469
Do you know what language
they speak in England?

1589
01:48:13,561 --> 01:48:17,349
- Pakistani?
- That's right. In many stores they do.

1590
01:48:17,441 --> 01:48:20,160
But we'll get into that tomorrow,
boys and girls.

1591
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:22,994
- You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.
- I'm gonna give you two.

1592
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:25,470
- All right, dear.
- Here's one on the cheek...

1593
01:48:25,561 --> 01:48:30,191
- ..and here's a monkey bite!
- Aaarghhh! Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!

1594
01:48:30,801 --> 01:48:34,316
Well, that's all for today. Bye-bye.

1595
01:48:34,401 --> 01:48:36,198
(director)
Cut!

1596
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:39,795
That's a wrap, folks! Thank you very much.

1597
01:48:44,001 --> 01:48:47,960
We're a smash! Number one in our time slot!

1598
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:51,636
Yes! Calls from Detroit, Cleveland,
Chicago, Los Angeles...

1599
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:54,679
- All with offers to syndicate.
- Hollywood!

1600
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,194
- Daniel?
- (whoop of joy)

1601
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:58,272
- Daniel?
- Yes?

1602
01:48:58,361 --> 01:49:02,513
- Miranda.
- Could I talk to you?

1603
01:49:04,241 --> 01:49:05,754
Yeah.

1604
01:49:05,841 --> 01:49:08,309
I'll be right out. Just wait here.

1605
01:49:29,601 --> 01:49:31,990
Welcome to Euphegenia's house.

1606
01:49:32,081 --> 01:49:35,312
A little draughty but... you know. It's nice.

1607
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:39,992
What can I do for you?

1608
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:44,201
First of all, congratulations on the show.

1609
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:47,159
Thanks. You got to see the dress rehearsal.

1610
01:49:48,441 --> 01:49:50,830
We've... The kids...

1611
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:54,275
We've been watching every day.

1612
01:49:55,401 --> 01:49:58,552
It's nice to know they can see me every day.

1613
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:05,592
Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take
a long time to get over all the fights and...

1614
01:50:05,681 --> 01:50:09,151
..all the horrible things we said to each other.

1615
01:50:09,241 --> 01:50:11,550
It's... It's so hard.

1616
01:50:13,201 --> 01:50:17,433
But I know somehow you and I will be
all right and we'll get through this.

1617
01:50:19,921 --> 01:50:22,230
But the kids...

1618
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:26,752
I don't wanna hurt our children.

1619
01:50:29,361 --> 01:50:31,352
So what do you want me to do?

1620
01:50:31,441 --> 01:50:35,992
You want me to pretend everything's
all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?

1621
01:50:37,201 --> 01:50:40,238
Jesus, Miranda.
You took my children away from me.

1622
01:50:40,321 --> 01:50:42,596
I can only see them now with supervision.

1623
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:46,435
Some woman watches me with the kids
like I'm some sort of deviant.

1624
01:50:46,521 --> 01:50:50,070
If I try to hug 'em, she wonders why.
You know what that's like?

1625
01:50:50,481 --> 01:50:55,271
You just sat there in that courtroom and
let that judge pass that despicable sentence.

1626
01:50:55,361 --> 01:50:57,636
- I was angry.
- Oh, God.

1627
01:50:57,721 --> 01:51:00,235
- You hurt me, too!
- You ripped my heart out!

1628
01:51:00,321 --> 01:51:03,757
You lied... Uh, you know what?
I don't wanna do this any more.

1629
01:51:03,841 --> 01:51:06,753
I don't wanna do any more
"who did what to whom".

1630
01:51:06,841 --> 01:51:08,638
(Miranda sighs)

1631
01:51:09,841 --> 01:51:13,311
Ever since this happened,
I've been trying to make sense out of it.

1632
01:51:13,401 --> 01:51:17,235
And the only thing I know in my heart
is that the children were happier...

1633
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:19,994
..when Mrs Doubtfire was a part of their lives.

1634
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:21,560
Yeah?

1635
01:51:22,521 --> 01:51:26,036
She... She brought out the best in them.

1636
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:30,550
- She brought out the best in you.
- And you.

1637
01:51:30,841 --> 01:51:32,832
Yeah.

1638
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:37,916
They miss her terribly.

1639
01:51:39,961 --> 01:51:43,715
- What are you saying?
- Daniel, the kids need you.

1640
01:51:52,001 --> 01:51:53,992
I need them.

1641
01:52:00,441 --> 01:52:03,717
Well, tomorrow we'll have Frank,
who is a make-up artist.

1642
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:07,077
- (knocking)
- Oh! A big knock at the door.

1643
01:52:07,161 --> 01:52:10,278
Who could that be?
And do we have enough time?

1644
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:13,510
Mr Sprinkles, boys and girls!

1645
01:52:13,601 --> 01:52:15,910
Hello! What do you have for me today?

1646
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:20,711
- Mrs Doubtflier, I've got a letter from Katie...
- (doorbell)

1647
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,392
It's the new baby-sitter.

1648
01:52:24,361 --> 01:52:26,556
Come on, guys! Get up! Let's go!

1649
01:52:28,801 --> 01:52:30,792
Come on.

1650
01:52:31,601 --> 01:52:33,796
It's gonna be all right.

1651
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:36,475
Chris, wait right over there. Everybody.

1652
01:52:47,441 --> 01:52:49,432
Daddy!

1653
01:52:51,361 --> 01:52:53,033
Hi.

1654
01:52:53,921 --> 01:52:57,596
- What's goin' on?
- I'm here to pick you up.

1655
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:01,630
Your dad's gonna take you
for a few hours every day after school.

1656
01:53:02,241 --> 01:53:04,232
Really?

1657
01:53:04,681 --> 01:53:07,070
What about the courts? That legal stuff.

1658
01:53:07,601 --> 01:53:10,240
- Ask your mom.
- I took care of it.

1659
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:14,556
No more supervised visits.
No more court liaison.

1660
01:53:14,641 --> 01:53:17,519
- Just us?
- Just us.

1661
01:53:28,481 --> 01:53:30,472
Go get Mr Bear.

1662
01:53:30,841 --> 01:53:33,719
- Go get your stuff. Hurry up.
- All right.

1663
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:41,351
- Would you like to come in?
- I'll wait outside.

1664
01:53:41,441 --> 01:53:42,840
OK.

1665
01:53:45,961 --> 01:53:47,952
Thank you.

1666
01:53:52,841 --> 01:53:54,240
See ya.

1667
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:00,996
(Mrs Doubtfire) "Dear Mrs Doubtfire."

1668
01:54:01,081 --> 01:54:03,959
"Two months ago
my mom and dad decided to separate."

1669
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:06,111
"Now they live in different houses."

1670
01:54:06,521 --> 01:54:11,595
"My brother Andrew says that we aren't
a real family any more. Is this true?"

1671
01:54:11,681 --> 01:54:13,672
"Did I lose my family?"

1672
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:17,879
"Is there anything I could do
to get my parents back together?"

1673
01:54:17,961 --> 01:54:19,952
"Sincerely, Katie McCormick."

1674
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:24,752
Oh, my dear Katie.

1675
01:54:26,201 --> 01:54:31,400
You know, some parents get along
much better when they don't live together.

1676
01:54:31,481 --> 01:54:35,110
They don't fight all the time
and they can become better people.

1677
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:38,113
Much better mommies and daddies for you.

1678
01:54:38,201 --> 01:54:41,193
And sometimes they get back together.

1679
01:54:42,161 --> 01:54:44,152
And sometimes they don't, dear.

1680
01:54:44,841 --> 01:54:46,832
And if they don't,...

1681
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:49,389
..don't blame yourself.

1682
01:54:49,481 --> 01:54:54,157
Just because they don't love each other
doesn't mean that they don't love you.

1683
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:58,877
There are all sorts of different families, Katie.

1684
01:54:58,961 --> 01:55:02,954
Some families have one mommy,
some families have one daddy,...

1685
01:55:03,041 --> 01:55:05,032
..or two families.

1686
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:07,681
Some children live with their uncle or aunt.

1687
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:12,596
Some live with their grandparents,
and some children live with foster parents.

1688
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:15,593
Some live in separate homes
and neighbourhoods...

1689
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:17,672
..in different areas of the country.

1690
01:55:17,761 --> 01:55:23,438
They may not see each other for days,
weeks, months or even years at a time.

1691
01:55:24,881 --> 01:55:26,872
But if there's love, dear,...

1692
01:55:28,241 --> 01:55:30,630
..those are the ties that bind.

1693
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:34,757
And you'll have a family in your heart for ever.

1694
01:55:36,881 --> 01:55:39,190
All my love to you, poppet.

1695
01:55:39,281 --> 01:55:41,272
You're going to be all right.

1696
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:45,512
Bye-bye.

1697
