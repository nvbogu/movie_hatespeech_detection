2,Dr. Meade!
4,"Oh, can you help me"
5,find Dr. Meade?
7,"God, help us."
9,"God, save"
10,the Confederacy!
12,"Hello, my fellow Americans."
14,They say we may have lost the battle
15,but we didn't lose the war.
17,"Yes, my friends,"
18,we are under attack.
20,You may have read about this
21,in your local newspapers
23,or seen it
24,on the evening news.
26,That's right.
28,We are living in an era
29,marked by the spread
31,of integration
32,and miscegenation.
34,The Brown decision.
36,Ah-ah-ah!
38,"The Brown decision,"
40,forced upon us by
41,the Jewish-controlled puppets
43,"on the U.S. Supreme Court,"
45,compelling white children
46,to go to school
48,"with an inferior race,"
50,is the final nail
51,in a coffin.
53,Is the final nail
54,in a black coffin
56,towards America becoming
57,a mongrel nation.
59,We had a great way
60,of life. We had.
62,"Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma!"
64,We had a great way of life.
66,We had a great way of life
68,until the Martin Luther Coons
69,of this world
71,and their army of Commies
73,started their
74,civil rights assault
76,against our holy white
77,Protestant values.
79,Do you really want your precious white child
80,going to school with Negroes?
82,"They're lying, dirty monkeys,"
84,stopping at nothing to gain
85,their equality with white men.
87," Oh, my God."
88," Rapists, murderers,"
90,craving the virgin white.
92," Is it ""virgin pure""?"
93, Yes.
95,"Rapists, murderers,"
97,craving the virgin pure
98,flesh of white women.
100,They are super predators!
102,"And the Negro's insidious tactics,"
103,"under the tutelage of high-ranking,"
105,"blood-sucking Jews,"
107,using an army of outside
108,northern black beast.
110,"What is it? ""Black beast."""
112," ""Agitators."""
113," God, watch this! God!"
115,Using an army of outside
116,northern black beast agitators
118,determined to overthrow
119,the God-commanded
121,and biblically inspired rule
122,of the white race.
124,It's an international
125,Jewish conspiracy.
127,May God bless us all.
129,God
130,"bless you, too, sir."
132,Why weren't you drafted
133,into the Vietnam War?
135,"I went to college, sir."
137,How do you feel
138,about Vietnam?
140,"I have mixed feelings, sir."
142,Would you call yourself
143,a womanizer?
145," No, I would not, sir."
146, You frequent nightclubs?
148," No, sir."
149, Do you drink?
151,Only on special
152,"occasions, sir."
154,Ever done any drugs?
156,Only those prescribed
157,"by my doctor, sir."
159,"Well, that's kind of rare for a young,"
160,hip soul brother like you.
162,"Uh, yes, sir."
164,But my father
165,"was in the military,"
167,"and my parents,"
168,they raised me the right way.
170,How do you get along
171,"with people, generally?"
173,"Sir, they treat me right,"
174,I treat them right.
176,"Like I said before,"
177,"I was raised up the right way, so."
179,"I mean, have you ever"
180,had any negative.
182,What would you do if another cop
183,called you a nigger?
185,Or worse.
187,"Would that happen, sir?"
189,Shit.
191,There's never been
192,a black cop in this city.
194,"Now, if we make you an officer,"
195,"you will, in effect,"
197,be the Jackie Robinson of
198,the Colorado Springs Police Force.
200,And if you know anything
201,"about Jackie Robinson,"
203,you know he had to take
204,"a lot of, uh, guff"
206,"from his fellow teammates,"
207,"the fans,"
209,other teams and the press.
211,I know the Jackie Roosevelt Robinson
212,"story, sir."
214,"Good. So, knowing that,"
215,"if somebody calls you a nigger,"
217,will you be able
218,to turn the other cheek?
220,"If I had to, sir, yes."
222,"Yes, I would."
224,"Son, the mayor,"
225,the Chief and I think
227,you might be the man
228,to open things up around here.
230,Chief Bridges will be
231,your Branch Rickey.
233,I'll have your back.
235,But I can only do so much.
237,The weight of this
238,is going to be on you
240,and you alone.
242,"Thank you for the opportunity,"
243,gentlemen.
245, Wow. Cybill Shepherd.
246, Yeah.
248,I loved her
249,in The Last Picture Show.
251,Never saw it.
253,I don't like
254,black-and-white movies.
256,"So, what do you think?"
258,I think she's
259,a really good actress.
261,"Oh, come on. You know"
262,you want some of that.
264,Looking for a toad here.
266,You're up.
268,Give me the record
269,"for that toad, Maurice Smalls."
271,"While you're at it,"
272,"grab another toad,"
274,Tippy Birdsong.
276,T-I-P-P-Y.
278,Can I help you?
280,May I have
281,"a minute, please?"
283,Sit.
285,"Sergeant Trapp,"
286,"Chief Bridges,"
288,I'll get right to it.
290,I'd like to be
291,an undercover detective.
293,"What, like Narcotics?"
295,Whichever department
296,"works, sir."
298,You just joined
299,"the force, rookie."
301,I think I can do
302,some real good there.
304, Is that right?
305, I'm young.
307,There's a real niche for me.
309,Get in where I fit in.
311,You think a lot
312,"of yourself, don't you?"
314,I'll do
315,whatever it takes.
317,And I hate
318,the records room.
320,Well.
322,I think records is a good place for you
323,"to start, rookie."
325,"Chief, do you want me"
326,clean-shaven?
328,I can even chop down
329,the natural.
331,"No, no, no. You keep it."
333,I like the look.
335,I need a file on a toad.
337,You deaf?
339,I said I need
340,a file on a toad.
342, No toads here.
343, Excuse me?
345,I said I don't
346,have any toads.
348,I do have human beings.
350,"You give me their names,"
351,I'll get you the file.
353,I heard you think
354,"you're hot shit,"
356,but you ain't nothing
357,but a cold fart.
359,The name
360,is Steven Wilson.
362,Was that respectful
363,"enough for you,"
365,Officer Toad?
367, Hello.
368, It's Bridges.
370,You sleeping?
372,"Uh, yeah, Chief."
374,Um.
376,Worked an all-night shift.
378,I've changed my mind.
380,You're coming in
381,a little early today.
383,I got an assignment for you.
385,12:00 noon sharp.
387,Narcotics division.
389," Yes, sir."
390, Wear street clothes.
392,Thank you.
394,CP time?
396,"Jimmy, the rookie's late."
398," You're late, rookie."
399, Sorry. Won't happen again.
401,"We have limited time,"
402,so I'll be quick.
404,"The black radical,"
405,"Stokely Carmichael,"
407,is giving a speech tonight
408,at Bell's Nightingale.
410, Yep.
411, Carmichael is a former
413,high-muckety-muck
414,with the Black Panthers.
416,"And as far as I'm concerned,"
417,FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
419,was dead right when he said
420,the Black Panthers
422,are the greatest internal threat to
423,the security of these United States.
425,"This Carmichael joker,"
427,"former Panther or not, well,"
428,"they say he is a damn good speaker,"
430,and so we don't want
431,this Carmichael
433,getting into the minds
434,of the good black people
436,here in Colorado Springs
437,and stirring them up.
439,"Ron, your assignment is to go"
440,"to this speech tonight,"
442,infiltrate this bunch
443,of subversives
445,and just monitor the audience reaction
446,to Carmichael's speech.
448, You ready?
449, Born ready.
451,I'm not ready.
453,Any chance
454,this thing fucks up?
456,"Oh, fuck yeah."
458,Then what?
460, Just stick to the game plan.
461, Which is?
463,"Eh, improvise."
465, Like jazz.
466, Like bebop.
468,This isn't some big bust.
470,We just want some intel.
471,That's it.
473,And what if someone offers you
474,a marijuana cigarette?
476, You mean a joint?
477, Yeah.
479,Mary Jane.
481,Excuse me.
483,"Soul brother,"
485,I'm already high
486,on life. Can you dig it?
488, It's dug.
489, My man.
491,And if someone pulls
492,a gun on you?
494,Will that happen?
496, Barrel of a.45 in your face.
497, Shit.
499,Finger on the trigger.
500,Now what?
502,"Blood, get that gun"
503,out of my face.
505,"Peace, love and soul."
507,Gun is still in your face.
509,"I de-escalate,"
510,"talk calmly, firmly."
512,Find a way
513,out of there ASAP.
515,Relax. We'll be outside
516,listening in.
518, Okay.
519, Got it?
521,I got it. I'm gone.
523,Here we go.
525, We need to take action.
526, I can't believe he's here.
528,I just have so many
529,questions to ask him.
531,"But, um."
533,"How are you, uh."
535,How are you doing
536,"this evening, my sister?"
538,Can we help you?
540,"I'm doing fine, my brother."
542,What? We don't know him.
544,"What? Hakeem,"
545,why you dragging me?
547,It's going to be
548,an amazing night.
550,"Indeed, it is."
552,Have you heard Brother Kwame
553,speak before?
555,Who?
557,Kwame Ture.
559,"Oh! Well, actually, I haven't, but."
561, Okay.
562, I didn't realize he changed his name.
564,"Yes, after he"
565,moved to Africa.
567,He took the names
568,of Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana
570,"and his mentor,"
571,"Sékou Touré of Guinea,"
573,to honor the great leaders.
575," Well, that is heavy."
576, Mmm-hmm.
578,You know how he got
579,to Colorado Springs?
581,"Yeah, yeah."
582,The Colorado College Black Student Union invited him.
584," Oh, I can dig it. I can dig it."
585, Mmm-hmm.
587,Are you.
588,Are you part of the Union?
590,I'm the president.
592,Really? I'm talking
593,to the president right now?
595,"Yes, you are."
597,"Right on, sister."
599,"Well, I bought a ticket."
601,May I skip the line since I'm talking
602,to the president?
604,There's no cutting
605,in line.
607,To the back.
609,See you inside?
611,"I'll see you inside,"
612,my brother.
614, Mrs. President.
615, Right on.
617,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
619,The Black Student Union
620,of Colorado College
622,is honored to bring the vanguard
623,of revolutionaries
625,fighting for the rights of black people
626,all over the world.
628,Let's show some black love
630,"to the one and only,"
631,the brother man with a plan
633, who is sticking it to the man.
634," Right on, right on."
636,"Put your hands together,"
637,"my people, for our Kwame Ture."
639,"Thank you, Sister Patrice."
641, Thank you.
642, And the Black Student Union.
644,"I want to thank all of you,"
646,"my beloved sisters and brothers,"
647,for coming out tonight.
649,Okay!
651,But I'm here tonight
652,to tell you
654,that it is time
656,for you to stop running away
657,from being black.
659,Boom-shaka-laka!
661,It is time for you to stop
662,running away from being black.
664,You're college
665,"students, right?"
667, Right on.
668, That's right.
670,You should think.
672,It is time for you
673,"to understand that you,"
675,as the growing intellectuals
676,"of this country,"
678,that you must define beauty
679,for black people.
681, Okay!
682," Now, that's Black Power."
684,Let me ask you something.
685,Is beauty defined
687,as someone
688,with a narrow nose?
690, No!
691, Thin lips?
693,No!
695,White skin?
697,Hell no!
699, Hell no.
700, Hell no!
702,'Cause you ain't got
703,none of that.
705,No. Okay.
707,Our lips are thick.
709, Yes.
710," Yes, they are!"
712,Our noses broad.
714, Our hair is nappy.
715, Yes!
717,"We are black,"
718,and we are beautiful!
720, Yes!
721, Boom-shaka-laka!
723,"You see,"
725,we want to be so much
726,like the white people
728,who oppress us
729,in this country.
731, Nope!
732," And because they hate us,"
734,and because we are ashamed
735,"of our African heritage,"
737,we then hate ourselves.
739,Preach.
741,Y'all don't hear me tonight.
743,We hear you.
745,Y'all dig Tarzan?
747,Tarzan. I'm gonna be honest.
749,"When I was a boy, I used to go"
750,to the Saturday matinees
752,and watch Tarzan
753,all the time.
755, Okay.
756," Yeah, yeah."
758,And white Tarzan used to
759,beat up the black natives.
761,"And I would sit there,"
762,"yelling, ""Kill the beasts!"
764,"""Kill the savages."
766,"""Kill them."
768,"""Kill them! Kill them!"
769,"Kill them!"""
771,But what I was saying
772,"was, ""Kill me."""
774,That's right.
776,It was as if a young Jewish boy
777,saw Nazis
779,taking Jews off
780,to concentration camps
782,and cheered them on.
784,"Today, I want those chiefs"
785,to beat the hell out of Tarzan
787,and send his lily-white ass
789,on back to the caves of Europe.
791,Boom-shaka-laka!
792, Right on.
794,Right on.
796,But it takes time.
798,It takes time to become
799,free of the lies
801,and their shaming effects
802,on the black mind.
804, Okay.
805, It takes time to reject
807,"the most important lie,"
809,that black people can't do
810,the same things
812, that white people do.
813, That's a lie.
815,.unless a white person
816,helps them.
818,Talk about it.
820,Black Power also means
821,that we must unite.
823,"We must unite,"
824,and we must organize
826,to form a base
827,to fight racism.
829, Okay!
830, Yes. Yes.
832,To fight our oppressors.
834,The vast majority of Negroes
835,"around this country,"
837,they live
838,in captive communities.
840,And they must endure
841,their oppression
843,"and their conditions,"
844,because and only because
846, they are black and powerless.
847, Educate. Educate.
849,And now.
851,Now we are being shot down
852,like dogs in the streets
854,by white racist cops.
856,Speak the truth.
858,I said
859,we are being shot down
861,in the streets
862,by white racist cops!
864,Fuck the police.
866,We can no longer endure
868,this kind of oppression
869,without retribution.
871,Hell no!
873,No more.
875,"That war in Vietnam,"
877,"it is not only illegal,"
878,it is immoral.
880, That's right.
881, Talk about it.
883,And you know
884,what I tell them?
886,"Hell no, we won't go!"
888,"Hell no, we won't go!"
890,"Hell no, we won't go!"
892,We ain't going!
894,I'd rather see a brother
896,kill a white racist cop
897,than kill a Vietnamese.
899,"Me, too."
901,"Because at least,"
903,if he kills a racist cop
904,"he is doing it for a reason,"
906,because they are
907,shooting black people.
909, That's right.
910," .in the backs,"
912,"in these streets,"
913,right here in this very country.
915, They're killing us like dogs!
916, Boom-shaka-laka!
918,Right here!
920,Right here!
922,"I just want to leave you,"
923,"uh, in closing"
925,'cause I know it's getting late
926,and y'all gotta go party.
928,"I'm sorry, study."
930,We love you!
932,"I just want to leave you,"
934,"sisters and brothers,"
935,with these last words.
937,"If I am not for myself,"
939,who will be?
941,"If I am for myself alone,"
942,who am I?
944, Right.
945," Hear, hear."
947," If not now, when?"
948, When?
950,"And if not you, who?"
952,Who? Who?
954,Who? Who?
956,We need an undying love
957,"for black people, wherever we may be."
959,All power to all the people.
961,All power to all the people!
963,All power to all the people!
965,All power to all the people!
967,"""All power to all the people."""
969,Pretty powerful stuff.
971,"Incredible words,"
972,Brother Kwame.
974, Thank you so much.
975, Thank you.
977,"Thank you, brother."
978,Appreciate it.
980,Brother.
982,I gotta ask you something.
984,Do you really think
986,war between the black race
987,and the white race is inevitable?
989,Let me tell you.
990,"Arm yourself, brother."
992,"Get ready,"
993,'cause the revolution is coming.
995,"Pick up a gun and arm yourself,"
996,"because trust me, it's coming."
998, Thank you for coming tonight.
999, God bless you.
1001,You looked great
1002,on that stage tonight.
1004," Thank you, my brother."
1005, All right.
1007,"I don't know what you have planned now,"
1008,but maybe I can buy you a drink?
1010,"Uh. I, uh."
1012,I gotta make sure
1013,Brother Kwame is all squared away.
1015, What?
1016, .and he gets to his hotel safely.
1018,I can dig it.
1020,"But, you know, um,"
1021,"if it's not too late,"
1023,maybe I can meet you
1024,at the Red Lantern?
1026,You know where that is?
1028,Mmm-hmm.
1030,So I'll see you then.
1032,Damn right. Yes. Cool.
1034,All power
1035,to all the people.
1037,Hey. How you doing?
1039, Sorry I'm late.
1040, Hey.
1042,You won't believe
1043,what happened.
1045,What are you having?
1047,"Bro Pope,"
1048,"7 and 7, please."
1050,Pigs pulled us over.
1052,Say what?
1054,I don't want to see nothing
1055,but black asses and black elbows.
1057,Spread 'em!
1059,You that so-called big-shot
1060,"Panther nigger, aren't you?"
1062,I heard you was
1063,"in town, Stokely."
1065,My name is Kwame Ture.
1067,I don't give two shits
1068,what your nigger name is!
1070,"Black bitch,"
1071,you get this Black Panther
1073,out of Colorado Springs
1074,"before sunrise, you hear me?"
1076, Or you'll all go to jail.
1077, We were born in jail.
1079,Ooh.
1081,Don't touch me!
1083, Don't touch her!
1084, Get your fucking hands off of me!
1086, Get your hands off of her!
1087, Get your white hands off!
1089,Keep your hands off of her!
1090,"Come on, get your hands off of her!"
1092,Get off of me!
1093,Get off of me!
1095, Wait!
1096," Let her go, man!"
1098,You see the officers' names?
1100,"I know I should have, but."
1102,The whole thing
1103,"was so frightening,"
1105,I didn't.
1107,Come on.
1109, Let's dance. Follow me.
1110, Mmm.
1112,"Come on. Come on,"
1113,"come on, come on."
1115,What?
1117,No.
1119," Come on, you know it, you know it."
1120, Uh-huh.
1122,What was the room like?
1124,Folks were hanging
1125,on every word.
1127,Like a Baptist church
1128,on Christmas Sunday morning.
1130, Huh.
1131, Mmm-hmm.
1133,Sounds like he had them
1134,pretty riled up.
1136,But I don't think that means black folks were
1137,"ready to start the revolution, Chief."
1139,What makes you say that?
1141,Nobody in there
1142,was talking about that.
1144,That wasn't the vibe.
1145,Everybody was cool.
1147,Let me get this straight.
1149,He told a room of black folk
1150,to get ready for a race war.
1152,That they were going to have to
1153,arm themselves and kill cops.
1155,"I mean, what about that?"
1157,"Yeah, he said that, but,"
1158,"Chief, I think it was just talk, you know?"
1160,Rhetoric.
1162,"That's what I thought, too."
1164, Jimmy?
1165, Like my partner said.
1167,"All right, well, thank goodness"
1168,Carmichael has left Colorado Springs.
1170, Kwame Ture.
1171, What?
1173,He changed his name
1174,from Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture.
1176,I don't care if he changed his name to
1177,"that draft dodger, Muhammad Ali."
1179,All right? He's still dangerous.
1181, Did you hear the story Patrice told me?
1182," No, I didn't."
1184,About how the CSPD
1185,pulled over her and Ture?
1187,"Patrice, she's the one"
1188,"from the Black Student Union,"
1190,the group
1191,that brought in Ture?
1193,"Kwame Ture. Correct, sir."
1195,Getting pretty chummy
1196,"with her, huh?"
1198,"No, just doing my job, Chief. Undercover."
1200,Let's just make sure it ain't
1201,under the cover of the sheets.
1203,I would never jeopardize
1204,"a case, sir."
1206,He doesn't know
1207,what he'd do.
1209,You're new.
1211,You guys sit tight.
1212,"Ron, come with me."
1214,"Ron, I'm transferring you"
1215,to Intelligence.
1217,What will I be
1218,doing there?
1220,Intelligence.
1222,Against my
1223,better judgment.
1225,"Five, four,"
1226,"three, two, one."
1228,Swish!
1230,Police department.
1232,He is at lunch.
1234,"Excuse me? Yes, yes."
1236,You have reached
1238,the Colorado Springs chapter
1239,of the Ku Klux Klan.
1241,Please leave a message.
1243,And God bless white America.
1245,Hello. This is
1246,Ron Stallworth calling.
1248,I saw your advertisement in
1249,the Colorado Springs Gazette.
1251,I'm interested in receiving
1252,some reading materials from you.
1254,My phone number is 103-9994.
1256,I'm very much looking forward
1257,to you returning my call.
1259," Yeah, who's this?"
1260, Ron Stallworth here.
1262,This is Walter
1263,returning your call.
1265,From the Organization.
1267,The Organization?
1269,That's right.
1271,We appreciate your interest.
1273,What's your story?
1275,"Well, since you asked."
1277,"Since you asked,"
1278,I hate niggers.
1280, I hate Jews.
1281, Huh?
1283,Spics and Micks.
1285,Dagos and Chinks.
1287,"But my mouth to God's ears,"
1288,I really hate those nigger rats.
1290,"And anyone else, really,"
1291,that doesn't have
1293,pure white Aryan blood
1294,running through their veins.
1296,"My sister, Pamela,"
1298,she was just recently accosted
1299,by one of those black coons.
1301,Is that so?
1303,Yeah.
1305,Every time I think about
1306,that black baboon
1308,putting his filthy black hands
1310,on her
1311,pure-as-white-driven-snow body.
1313,"I mean pure, Walter."
1314,She's a saint. She's an angel.
1316,It makes me want to puke.
1318,You are just the kind of guy
1319,that we are looking for.
1321,"Listen, uh, when can you meet?"
1323,How about Friday night
1324,after I get off work?
1326,"That's a deal, buddy boy."
1328,We'll get right back to you
1329,with the details.
1331,"Take care, now."
1333,God bless white America.
1335,Did I just hear you use
1336,your real name?
1338,"Oh, motherfucker."
1340,"Yeah, motherfucker amateur hour."
1342,"That's your real name,"
1343,right? Isn't.
1345,Isn't it Ron Stallworth?
1346,"Right, isn't that his real name?"
1348,Can't believe
1349,he just said that.
1351,"Well, good luck, Ron,"
1352,with your new redneck friends.
1354,They want you
1355,to join the Klan?
1357,They want to meet me first.
1359, They want to meet you?
1360, Mmm-hmm.
1362,"Yeah, well, you probably"
1363,shouldn't go to that meeting.
1365,"Good call, Sarge."
1367,So you're a crazy
1368,"son of a bitch, huh?"
1370,We'd have to go
1371,"to Narcotics,"
1373,meaning we'd have to deal
1374,with Chief Bridges.
1376,"Yeah, I can't spare the men."
1378,"Well, I've looked over the logs,"
1379,"Chief, and it seems you can spare them."
1381,"Sergeant Trapp,"
1382,Ron spoke to the man on the phone.
1384,"All right, when they hear"
1385,"the voice of one of my guys,"
1387,they're gonna know
1388,the difference.
1390,"How so, Chief?"
1392,You want me
1393,to spell it out for you?
1395,They're going to know
1396,the difference
1398,between how a white man
1399,talks and a Negro.
1401,How exactly does
1402,a black man talk?
1404,"Okay, Ron, what I think"
1405,the Chief is trying to say.
1407,"If you don't mind,"
1408,I'd like to speak for myself.
1410," Thank you, Sarge."
1411, Sure.
1413,You know what
1414,I'm trying to say.
1416,"Chief, some of us"
1417,can speak King's English.
1419,Others speak jive.
1421,Ron Stallworth here
1422,happens to be fluent in both.
1424,"Okay, Ron, how do you propose"
1425,to make this investigation?
1427,"Well, I've established contact"
1428,and created some familiarity
1430,with the Klansman
1431,over the phone.
1433,"I'll continue in that role,"
1434,"but I'll need another officer,"
1436,"surprise, surprise,"
1437,"a white officer,"
1439,to play me when they meet
1440,face-to-face.
1442,"See, that's my point exactly."
1444,"Chief, black Ron Stallworth"
1445,"over the phone,"
1447,white Ron Stallworth
1448,"face-to-face,"
1450,so there becomes
1451,a combined Ron Stallworth.
1453, Can you do that?
1454, I believe we can.
1456,"With the right white man,"
1457,we can do anything.
1459,Anything happens
1460,"to one of my men,"
1462,there won't be
1463,two Ron Stallworths.
1465,There'll be none.
1467,You're late.
1469,Sorry. It'll never
1470,happen again.
1472,Seems like I heard
1473,that one before.
1475,"Jimmy, when's the last time"
1476,they let a rookie lead an investigation?
1478,"Oh, that's right. Never."
1480,"Okay, all right, let's move on."
1482,"Let's, uh."
1483,Let's go to our bio.
1485,Okay. Ron Stallworth.
1486,I do wholesale manufacturing.
1488, Whereabout?
1489, Pueblo.
1491, What's that commute like?
1492," Jimmy, I'm glad you asked."
1494,It's a straight shot
1495,down I-25.
1497," Hour, tops."
1498, It's a long ride.
1500,What do we listen to?
1502,"KWYD, Christian talk"
1503,"in the morning,"
1505,although the signal starts
1506,to cut out near Pueblo.
1508,"On the way back,"
1509,I like to turn it to 102.7
1511,to get my
1512,Allman Brothers fix.
1514,Only I have to change it
1515,"every time that British fag,"
1517,"David Bowie, pipes on."
1519,Whoa! I love Bowie.
1521,"I mean, who"
1522,"doesn't, right?"
1524,"Remember,"
1525,you have to retain
1527,all the information
1528,you share with these guys
1530,so I can be
1531,white Ron Stallworth.
1533,"Jimmy, I always"
1534,wanted to be black.
1536,All my heroes
1537,were black guys.
1539,Willie Mays.
1541, Basket catch.
1542, Wilt the Stilt.
1544,Record 100 points
1545,in one game.
1547,But you know
1548,my absolute favorite?
1550,O.J.
1552,Heisman pose!
1554, The Juice!
1555, I love fucking O.J.
1557,Orenthal James Simpson.
1559, Bet you didn't know that.
1560, Of course I did.
1562,We as a Negro people
1563,"appreciate your love,"
1565,but don't share that love
1566,with these guys.
1568,"For you, it's the fucking"
1569,"Osmonds, right?"
1571,"Hey, I love Marie Osmond."
1573,"I get to play you,"
1574,but you don't get to play me?
1576," Jimmy, does that sound fair?"
1577, Fair?
1579, Not to me.
1580," Now, what else?"
1582, Who are you meeting with?
1583, Walter Breachway.
1585,Become his friend.
1586,Let's get invited back.
1588,"Well, look at you."
1590,"Okay. Anything else, sir?"
1592,I'm on the phone
1593,with the Klan.
1595,You meet
1596,with them in person.
1598,And?
1600,And you need to try
1601,and sound like my voice.
1603,"Oh, boy."
1605,All right. Here.
1607," Me, too?"
1608," Yeah. You, too, Jimmy."
1610, Godfather.
1611, That's right.
1613,"You wanted to be black,"
1614,here's your chance.
1616,Lookie here.
1618,Some people say
1619,we've got a lot of malice.
1621,Some say it's a lot of nerve.
1623,Lookie here.
1625,Some people say we got a lot of malice.
1627, Some.
1628," Come on, come on."
1630,This is life and death here.
1631,Come on.
1633," Oh, is it?"
1634, Come on.
1636,Some say it's a lot
1637,of nerve. Nerve!
1639, You want me to do this now?
1640," Please, now."
1642,"For all our sakes,"
1643,"do it now, please."
1645,Some say it's
1646,a lot of nerve.
1648,"Let it flow, though."
1649,Let it flow.
1651, I'm flowing.
1652, Okay.
1654,I say we won't quit moving
1655,till we get what we deserve.
1657,I say we won't quit moving
1659,until we get
1660,what we deserve.
1662,"We've been buked,"
1663,and we've been scorned.
1665, We've been buke.
1666," ""Buked."" Say that."
1668," What does ""buked"" mean?"
1669, Disrespected.
1671,You've been
1672,"disrespected, Flip."
1674, You.
1675, Why doesn't he just say that?
1677,"We've been buked,"
1678,and we've been scorned.
1680,"This has got to flow,"
1681,from the.
1683,"We've been treated bad,"
1684,talked about.
1686,We've been buked.
1687,We've been scorned.
1689," All right, get that shit out."
1690," We've been treated bad, talked about."
1692,"Just as sure as you're born,"
1693,but just as sure as it take.
1695,Two eyes
1696,to make a pair. Huh!
1698, Two eyes to make a pair.

1710," Brother, we can't quit till we get our share."
1712,"Brother, we can't quit"
1713,till we get our share.
1715,"Doesn't make grammatical sense,"
1716,but okay.
1718,"Say it loud. I'm black,"
1719,and I'm proud.
1721,"Say it for O.J., Jimmy."
1722,"You, too."
1724,Say it loud.
1725,"I'm black, and I'm proud."
1727,Say it loud.
1728,"I'm black, and I'm proud."
1730,That's right. There it is.
1732,I believed you.
1734,Lose that Jewish necklace
1735,around your neck.
1737,"Jimmy, it's not a Jewish necklace."
1738,It's a Star of David.
1740,Okay.
1742,"Flip, you're Jewish?"
1744,I don't know. Am I?
1746,Ron Stallworth?
1748,That's me.
1750, You must be Walter.
1751, Name's Felix.

1776,"Oh, hell yeah."
1778,Been having trouble lately
1779,with these local niggers.
1781,"Ugh. Since the Civil War,"
1782,it's always trouble with niggers.
1784,Uh-huh.
1786,Walter said something
1787,about your sister.
1789,Makes me sick.
1791,What are they saying?
1792,They saying where they're going?
1794,"But it's also,"
1795,"you know, camaraderie,"
1797,I'm looking for
1798,with the Klan.
1800,What the fuck
1801,did you say?
1803, Camaraderie?
1804," No, the other word."
1806, The Klan?
1807," Not ""the Klan."""
1809,"It's ""the Organization."""
1811,The Invisible Empire has managed to stay
1812,invisible for a reason.
1814,Do not ever
1815,use that word.
1817,You understand?
1819,"Hey, I over-stand."
1821,Right. You got it.
1823,The Organization.
1825,Check this shit out.
1826,You're never gonna believe this.
1828,What?
1830,A fucking jig
1831,on our bumper.
1833," Ron, he sees us. Back off."
1834, Damn!
1836,Let's get ready.
1837,Look under your seat.
1839, Yeah.
1840, What?
1842,Pull it out.
1844,Load 'er up.
1846,Put two in the chamber.
1848,"Come on, load it up."
1850,"Come on, load it."
1852,Don't be messing with us.
1854,The Organization.
1856,"Not so fast, buddy boy."
1858,Hold your horses.
1860,Mmm!
1862,"Ron, glad you"
1863,could make it.
1865,"Walter Breachway,"
1866,chapter president.
1868,Ron Stallworth.
1869,I appreciate you inviting me out.
1871,Absolutely. I've been impressed with our
1872,conversations over the phone.
1874,I think you have a lot of fine ideas that
1875,could really help the cause.
1877,"Well, I meant"
1878,every word I said.
1880,"You know, I've had my own share"
1881,of run-ins with niggers.
1883,"Matter of fact, it's what"
1884,led me to the Organization.
1886, Is that right?
1887, It's become my salvation.
1889,"See, I was, uh,"
1891,shot and wounded
1892,by a couple niggers.
1894,Then my wife was savagely raped
1895,by a whole pack of 'em.
1897, God.
1898," That's right,"
1900, and not a one of them went to jail.
1901, Huh.
1903,Tell you what.
1905,They're taking over.
1907,"Hell, it's all you see"
1908,on TV anymore.
1910,Niggers selling soap.
1912,Niggers selling toothpaste.
1914,Niggers selling
1915,automobiles.
1917,"Everywhere you look,"
1918,"it's niggers, niggers, niggers."
1920,"Yeah, wasn't long ago"
1921,them sum bitches wasn't on no TV.
1923,You're forgetting about
1924,Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.
1926,Oh! Dang.
1928,I kind of like them niggers.
1930,Rice and pancakes.
1932,"Hey, uh, my name's Ivanhoe,"
1933,by the way.
1935,Hey. Ron.
1937,"Hey, all you get now is how we gotta"
1938,cater to them.
1940,"Now, watch your mouth. Yeah."
1942,Don't say this.
1943,Don't say that.
1945,Be nice.
1947,"Hell, they ain't even"
1948,colored no more.
1950,Negroes. Blacks.
1952, Afro-Americans now.
1953," Yeah, fuck it."
1955,Just call them fucking niggers.
1956,Make it fucking simple.
1958, Niggers.
1959, Niggers.
1961,That's the right idea.
1963,I've been saying
1964,this stuff for years.
1966,"Well, you ain't"
1967,the only one.
1969,It's good to know
1970,someone else gets it.
1972,"So, what kind of stuff"
1973,you guys do?
1975,What kind of stuff we do?
1977,"We, uh. Cross burnings"
1979,and marches and stuff
1980,so people don't fuck with us.
1982,I'm tired of niggers
1983,fucking with me.
1985,"Well, then you come"
1986,to the right place.
1988,Nobody fucks with us.
1990,"Now, how much you know"
1991,about the history?
1993,Some. I could know more.
1995,We will teach you.
1997,"Yeah, this is fixing"
1998,to be a big year for us.
2000,How so?
2002, Boom!
2003, All right.
2005,We're gonna make
2006,"fireworks, aren't we?"
2008,"All right, all right, Ivanhoe,"
2009,shut your dumb mouth.
2011,"Ivan, shut the fuck up."
2013, Burnt ends.
2014," All right, all right."
2016,That's enough.
2017,Shut your dumb mouth.
2019,Sorry about him.
2020,He drinks too much.
2022,Doesn't know
2023,what he's saying.
2025,"Just to be clear,"
2026,"the, uh."
2028,The Organization
2029,is strictly nonviolent.
2031,"Oh, nonviolent"
2032,"like that nigger,"
2034,"that dead nigger,"
2035,Martin Luther Coon.
2037," Yeah, gotcha."
2038, Ron? You mind coming with me?
2040,"Yeah, where to?"
2042,You undercover
2043,or something?
2045, You ask too many questions.
2046, All right.
2048,"Be friendly, now."
2050,This is family.
2051,All right?
2053,Let's go.
2055,Congrats. You passed
2056,the mustard.
2058,How about we go and get that
2059,membership process started?
2061, That's it?
2062, That's it.
2064,"Uh, have a seat."
2066,"Go ahead and, uh,"
2067,fill these out.
2069,Send 'em to
2070,the national headquarters.
2072,"Now, once they send you"
2073,"your membership card,"
2075,you'll be able to participate
2076,in all our programs.
2078,Alcoa can't wait.
2080,I love those commercials.
2082,Imperial tax
2083,"to become a member,"
2085,"$10 for the year,"
2086,$15 chapter fee.
2088,Robes and hoods are not
2089,included. That's extra.
2091,Fucking inflation.
2093,I can't thank you brothers enough.
2094,This means a lot to me.
2096,Pleasure's all ours.
2098,"You're not a Jew, right?"
2099,Jews killed Christ.
2101,Are you trying
2102,to offend me?
2104,Protocol.
2106,Course I'm no stinkin' kike.
2108,"All right, look,"
2109,"we gotta ask it, is all."
2111,"But he's not a Jew,"
2112,all right? Satisfied?
2114,Smells kosher to me.
2116, Stop fucking around.
2117, I fuck straight.
2119, Who you fucking?
2120, Double D!
2122,"All right, both of you,"
2123,give the man some space.
2125,Jesus Christ.
2126,Let him breathe a little.
2128,"Ron, let me"
2129,buy you a beer.
2131, Okay.
2132, Come on.
2134,Sorry about these guys.
2135,"They're a little, uh,"
2137,too friendly sometimes.
2139,They just get excited.
2141,Yeah.
2143, What kind of beer you like?
2144," Coors, if you got it."
2146,That was interesting.
2148,Not exactly
2149,the Beverly Hillbillies.
2151,They liked you.
2153,Except for that Felix guy.
2155,Do not ride
2156,his bumper like that.
2158,Two car lengths.
2160,You think he got
2161,a good look at my face?
2163,Probably.
2165,You get the papers?
2167,They want you to join.
2169,"Technically,"
2170,they want you to join.
2172,Yeah.
2174,"Yeah, they want a black man"
2175,to join the Ku Klux Klan.
2177,I'd say that's
2178,mission impossible.
2180,Double success.
2182,We're in!
2184,"Slow down, brother."
2185,Slow down.
2187,And exactly how much
2188,should we be worried about them?
2190,Enough that we'd like
2191,to dig deeper.
2193,One of the men discussed plans
2194,"for a possible attack, so."
2196,I wouldn't give him that much credit.
2197,These guys like to boast.
2199,What kind of attack?
2201,"Uh, Ivan."
2203,"Ivanhoe said ""boom,"" mentioned"
2204,something about fireworks.
2206,"But personally, I didn't buy it."
2207,I doubt they're even capable.
2209,"Either way, at this point,"
2210,we're looking for full support
2212,from the department
2213,"on this, Sarge."
2215,Let's move on with
2216,the investigation.
2218,Let's try to find out
2219,if they are capable of anything.
2221,Okay.
2223," Thank you, Sarge."
2224, You got it.
2226,When we dropped Brother Kwame
2227,"off at the airport,"
2229,he told me that
2230,the Black Power movement
2232,needed strong sisters like me
2233,to lead the fight
2235,against capitalist oppression
2237,and the politicians and pigs
2238,who perpetuate it.
2240,His words almost made
2241,that whole pig nightmare worthwhile.
2243,What's wrong?
2245,What do you mean?
2247,What's wrong?
2249,I don't really
2250,use that word.
2252,What word?
2254,"""Pigs."""
2256,"Well, what else"
2257,would you call them?
2259,Cops.
2261,Police.
2263,Officers.
2265,A bunch of racist cops
2266,on a power trip.
2268,"So, you think all cops"
2269,are racist?
2271,It only takes one to pull a trigger
2272,on an innocent sister or brother.
2274,Hmm.
2276,Why were you at
2277,Brother Kwame's speech?
2279,He's got some good ideas.
2281,"I don't agree with all of them,"
2282,"but he's a smart brother,"
2284,definitely worth hearing.
2286,Are you down
2287,for the liberation of black people?
2289,Do we always have
2290,to talk politics?
2292,What's more important?
2294,Do you ever
2295,take time off?
2297,No. It's a lifetime job.
2299,"Sister Angela Davis,"
2300,"most righteous sister,"
2302,can we please spend
2303,some quality time together?
2305,And what did you say
2306,your J-O-B is?
2308,"Sister Kathleen Cleaver,"
2309,I didn't.
2311,Are you a pig?
2313,Excuse me?
2315,Are you a pig?
2317,You mean a cop?
2319,Are you a cop?
2321,No.
2323,I'm in construction.
2325,"But more importantly,"
2326,I'm a black man
2328,who wants to get
2329,"to know a strong,"
2331,"intelligent,"
2332,beautiful sister.
2334,The very one
2335,I'm looking at right now.
2337,You dig?
2339,Sure enough.
2341,That's what I'm talking about.
2342,Power to the people.
2344,All power
2345,to all the people.
2347," That's right, sister."
2348," Right on, right on."
2350, This is Walter.
2351, Ron here.
2353,This is Ron?
2355,"Sorry, your voice sounds"
2356,different over the phone.
2358,Uh.
2360,My allergies.
2361,Allergies acting up again.
2363,I get those all the time.
2365,"Listen, wanted to tell you"
2367,that it was a real pleasure
2368,to have you swing by.
2370,I think the brothers
2371,really took a liking to you.
2373,I'm honored.
2375,"If you're free Saturday,"
2376,why don't you swing by Felix's.
2378,You can meet the rest
2379,of the brotherhood. Hmm?
2381,Sounds good to me.
2383,"Well, I will see you then."
2385,I've got a friend.
2387,"He, uh, keeps up"
2388,with these groups.
2390,He says they're moving away
2391,"from the old violent, racist style."
2393,"So, that's what Duke"
2394,is peddling now.
2396,"It's, uh,"
2397,becoming mainstream.
2399, Duke?
2400, David Duke.
2402,Current grand wizard
2403,of the Klan.
2405,But he's always
2406,"in a three-piece suit,"
2408,never seen in a hood
2409,"or robe in public,"
2411,and he now goes
2412,"by ""national director."""
2414,So he's clearly got
2415,his sights on higher office.
2417, Politics? How so?
2418, Yeah.
2420,Think it's another way
2421,to sell hate.
2423, Keep going.
2424, Think about it.
2426,"Affirmative action,"
2427,"immigration, crime, tax reform."
2429,Mmm.
2431,He says no one wants
2432,to be called a bigot anymore.
2434,I guess Archie Bunker
2435,made that too uncool.
2437,"So the idea is,"
2438,"under all these issues,"
2440,everyday Americans
2441,"can accept it,"
2443,"support it,"
2444,"until eventually, one day,"
2446,he gets somebody
2447,in the White House that embodies it.
2449,Sarge.
2451,Come on.
2453,America would never elect
2454,somebody like David Duke
2456,president of
2457,the United States of America.
2459,"Coming from a black man,"
2460,that's pretty naive.
2462,Why don't you wake up?
2464,"Ron, hi. I'm Connie, Felix's wife."
2465,It's so nice to meet you.
2467,Oh.
2469, Want to come right in?
2470, Sure.
2472," Do you mind if I, uh, smoke in there?"
2473," Oh, not at all."
2475,"I'm telling you,"
2476,a war's a-coming.
2478,That'll be the end
2479,of the purified white race
2481, as we know it.
2482, They're right inside.
2484,Just make yourself
2485,right at home.
2487,It's time we go
2488,on the offensive.
2490, We gotta make sure that everybody.
2491," Hey, man."
2493," Hello. Hey, fellas."
2494, Welcome. Welcome.
2496,"This is Ron, everybody."
2498, Mr. Stallworth.
2499, All right.
2501, That's Mike.
2502," Hey, Mike. How are you? Ron."
2504, Scott in the back.
2505, Ron. How are you.
2507, Jesup.
2508, Hey. How are you?
2510," Ron, why don't you have a seat."
2511," Sorry to interrupt,"
2513,but I brought
2514,some cheese dip and crackers.
2516,Would you like some?
2518," Thanks, honey."
2519, Thank you.
2521, Walter?
2522, Make them remember
2524,who we are
2525,and what we stand for.
2527,We are the Organization.
2529, We have to.
2530, Oh! Oh! Oh! I read something in the Gazette
2532,that this nigger
2533,named Carmichael held a rally
2535,and that some
2536,college nigger girl
2538,from the Baboon Student Union
2539,was attacking our police.
2541,"I mean, this girl"
2542,is dangerous.
2544,"She's like that Commie,"
2545,Angela Davis.
2547,And I just.
2548,I think we should shut her mouth.
2550,Here.
2552,I cut the article.
2554,That'll be all.
2556,"Love you, sweetie."
2558,"Someday,"
2560,you're going to need me
2561,to do something for you.
2563,Just wait and see.
2565,And I will be
2566,right in here.
2568,"Why don't we, uh, get back"
2569,to our bread and butter.
2571,Let's talk about
2572,"the next cross burning,"
2574,"which, Ron, you'll be lucky"
2575,enough to attend
2577,if your membership
2578,comes in time.
2580,It'll be a tremendous honor.
2582, The highest hills get the most eyes.
2583, Yeah.
2585,Prove you can read.
2587,"""Friday night last week,"
2589,"""the Colorado College"
2590,"Black Student Union."""
2592,"Hey, Ron."
2594,I gotta show you something.
2596,""".hosted a controversial talk"
2597,featuring Stokely Carmichael
2599,"""at Bell's Nightingale"
2600,"nightclub."""
2602,"""Black Student Union."""
2604,"""Black Student."""
2605,That go together to you?
2607,That sounds
2608,fucking weird to me.
2610,Lookie here.
2612,Wow. This is
2613,really something.
2615,Here's my favorite.
2617,12-gauge.
2619,I call this the Jew Killer.
2621,I call it
2622,a Remington Model 1900.
2624,"Indeed, it is."
2626,Okay.
2628,We about done here?
2629,We got a few more items on the.
2631,Not just yet.
2633,Gotta make sure
2634,there's no Jew in him.
2636,"All right, now you're just"
2637,being offensive.
2639,Okay? We're talking
2640,about someone
2642,who's gonna be our brother
2643,in a few months.
2645,You see a Star of David
2646,around his neck?
2648,Is there a yarmulke
2649,on Ron's head?
2651,Just protocol.
2653,"My house, my rules."
2655,This way.
2657,Where we going now?
2659,I gotta
2660,show you something.
2662,Tough titty.
2664,"It's not necessary, Felix."
2666,This is how
2667,we lose recruits.
2669,You are going to take
2670,this lie detector test.
2672, Take a seat.
2673, What is this?
2675,Is this your Jew den?
2677,Is this where you make
2678,"your candles,"
2680,"you know,"
2681,and your lampshades?
2683,"No, you're gonna take"
2684,this lie detector test.
2686,Open the damn door.
2688,This is some lame bullshit.
2690,"Lame or not, you're taking"
2691,this Jew lie detector test.
2693, Sit down.
2694," Okay, Felix."
2696,Out of respect
2697,"for this Organization,"
2699,I'll play along with your
2700,"little Get Smart bullshit,"
2702,but I'm no fucking Jew.
2704,Sit down.
2706,Ask anybody.
2708,They'll say
2709,I'm a real friendly guy.
2711,"Thing is, I'm only friendly"
2712,to my friends.
2714,Not Jew friendly.
2716,Damn sure
2717,not nigger friendly.
2719," Me, neither."
2720, Know what I think?
2722, You think?
2723," Oh, yeah, I think."
2725,What do you think about?
2727,This Holocaust stuff
2729,never happened.
2731,That's the biggest Jewish
2732,conspiracy ever.
2734,Eight million Jews killed?
2735,Concentration camps?
2737,Never happened.
2739, Where's the proof?
2740, Are you high?
2742,I don't get high.
2744,I drink.
2746,'Cause I'd say the Holocaust
2748,is one of the most beautiful
2749,things I've ever seen.
2751,It just makes sense to me.
2753,You have a whole race
2754,of leeches
2756,that you have to get rid of.
2758,"So, what do you do? You starve them,"
2759,"you burn them, you get rid of them."
2761,It's like weeding out roots
2762,for the better people.
2764, Haven't you seen the footage?
2765, That's fake.
2767,Jews run Hollywood.
2769,Fucking hell.
2771,Let me see your dick.
2773,You gonna shoot me?
2774,Put that gun away.
2776,I hear you Jews do something
2777,funny with your dicks.
2779,Some weird Jew shit.
2781, Is your dick circumstanced?
2782," Oh, is that what this is about?"
2784,"You're trying to see my big Jew dick,"
2785,you fucking faggot.
2787,"Who you calling a fucking faggot,"
2788,Jew faggot?
2790,"Now, put that fucking strap"
2791,on your arm.
2793,Put it on your arm!
2795,Oh!
2797, Felix!
2798," Connie, what's wrong?"
2800,Felix! Felix!
2802," Connie! Connie, what's wrong?"
2803, Felix! Felix!
2805, Connie!
2806, There's a black lawn jockey
2808,on our green lawn!
2810, Felix!
2811," I'm coming to you, honey!"
2813," Shit, shit."
2814, Felix!
2816,Kill that son of a bitch!
2818,"Yeah, keep driving,"
2819,"you black spear chucker,"
2821, piece of shit nigger!
2822, That son of a bitch!
2824,Fucked up
2825,"the window, man."
2827,Still want me to take
2828,your Jew detector test?
2830,Everybody back
2831,in the house!
2833,Back in the house now!
2835, Shit.
2836," Connie, you okay?"
2838, You okay? Back in the house.
2839, That's why we gotta get stronger.
2841, That's some bullshit!
2842," Back in the house, honey."
2844,That's what
2845,I've been telling all you boys.
2847,We need more guns!
2849,Lie detector?
2851,Shots fired?
2853,You fucking kidding me?
2855,It's a goddamn clusterfuck.
2857,You dickheads
2858,are fucking with me.
2860,You're jerking my chain.
2861,You're jerking my chain.
2863,I'm getting a reach-around from the Chief.
2864,It's a big fucking circle jerk!
2866, That's funny?
2867," No, sir."
2869,'Cause if Bridges
2870,"hears about this,"
2872,this whole fucking operation's
2873,going to be closed down.
2875,"Yeah, that's funny."
2877,And I'm going to be
2878,a fucking school crossing guard
2880,in fucking the ghetto
2881,of Five Points!
2883,"I mean, is he gonna"
2884,"hear about it, Sarge?"
2886,Cocksuckers.
2888,Hear about what?
2890,"Hey, guys."
2892,"Charles, can you"
2893,"give us five, please?"
2895,Sure.
2897,"I didn't want to say it with Trapp,"
2898,"but that peckerwood had a gun in my face,"
2900,and he was an ass hair away
2901,from pulling the trigger.
2903, And he didn't.
2904, But he could have.
2906,And then I would
2907,have been dead.
2909,For what?
2911,Stopping some jerk-offs
2912,from playing dress-up?
2914," Flip, it's intel."
2915," Well, I'm not risking my life"
2917,to prevent some rednecks
2918,from lighting a couple sticks on fire.
2920,This is the job.
2921,What's your problem?
2923,That's my problem.
2924,"For you, it's a crusade."
2926, Mmm-hmm.
2927," For me, it's a job."
2929,"It's not personal,"
2930,nor should it be.
2932,Why haven't you
2933,bought into this?
2935, Why should I?
2936," Because you're Jewish, brother."
2938,The so-called chosen people.
2940,You've been passing
2941,for a WASP.
2943,"White Anglo-Saxon Protestant,"
2944,"cherry pie, hot dog, white boy."
2946,Hmm.
2948,It's what some
2949,light-skinned black folks do.
2951,They pass for white.
2953,Doesn't that hatred
2954,"you've been hearing the Klan say,"
2956,doesn't that piss you off?
2958, 'Course it does.
2959, Then why you acting like
2961,you ain't got skin
2962,"in the game, brother?"
2964,"Rookie, that's"
2965,my fucking business.
2967,It's our business.
2969,"Now, I'm going to get you"
2970,your membership card
2972,so you can go
2973,to the cross burning
2975, and get in deeper with these guys.
2976, Okay.
2978,"Right, partner?"
2980,"Wake up, white man."
2981,The Negro wants your
2983, white woman and your job.
2984, Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me.
2986,"The Jew wants your money,"
2987,and this you.
2989,"Sorry, who am I talking to?"
2991,This is Ron Stallworth calling
2992,"from Colorado Springs, Colorado."
2994,"How are you today, sir?"
2996,I'm quite well. Thank you.
2997,"Uh, what can I do you for?"
2999,I desperately want to participate
3000,"in my chapter's honorary events,"
3002,but I can't until I receive
3003,my membership card.
3005,Of course that's something
3006,I can help you with.
3008,"Great. Um, who am"
3009,I speaking with?
3011,This is David Duke.
3013,Did you just say your name
3014,was David Duke?
3016,Last time I checked.
3018,Grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan?
3019,That David Duke?
3021,"Yes, that grand wizard"
3022,"and national director, yeah."
3024,"National director, too, huh?"
3026,"Yes, you're darn tooting."
3028,That's amazing.
3030,I'm honored to be speaking
3031,"with you, sir."
3033,I'm not afraid to say it.
3035,I consider you
3036,a true white American hero.
3038,Is there any other kind?
3040,"No, sir."
3042,I'm just happy to be talking
3043,to a true white American.
3045,Amen.
3047,It seems like there's less
3048,and less of us out there these days.
3050, Mmm.
3051, Mmm.
3053,"Now, about that"
3054,membership card.
3056,"Yeah, Ron,"
3057,I understand the situation.
3059,"Uh, we've had some"
3060,administrative problems here.
3062,It's caused a little bit
3063,of a backlog.
3065,"Tell you what,"
3066,I'm gonna see to it personally
3068,that your membership card
3069,"is processed,"
3071,approved and sent out today.
3072,How's that sound?
3074,"Thank you, sir."
3076,I can't express to you
3077,how much this means to me.
3079,"Ron, please."
3080,Pleasure's all mine.
3082,I look forward to hopefully meeting you
3083,"in person one day, and, uh."
3085,"Well, God bless white America."
3087," God bless white America, sir."
3088," Okay, take care."
3090,Excuse me.
3092,Watch where you're going.
3094,You could get hurt
3095,"like that, hot shot."
3097,The cop that pulled
3098,"Kwame Ture over that night,"
3100,was it Landers?
3102,How'd you know?
3104,I can smell them
3105,a mile away now.
3107,"What, do you got"
3108,Smell-O-Vision?
3110,He's been a bad cop
3111,for a long time.
3113, Yeah?
3114, Yeah.
3116,"Few years ago,"
3117,he shot and killed a black kid.
3119, Jesus.
3120," He said he had a gun,"
3122,but he wasn't that type.
3124,Why do you guys
3125,tolerate this?
3127,You want to be the guy
3128,that rats him out?
3130,You want to go
3131,to Landers' office now?
3133,'Cause we're a family.
3135,"And right or wrong,"
3136,we stick together.
3138,That reminds me
3139,of another group.
3141,"That's a bull's-eye, Ron."
3143,You guys heard about
3144,this Hide N Seek room?
3146,"Here, you got a decent bar"
3148,turned into
3149,a filthy fag bar overnight.
3151,Fucking fags everywhere
3152,these days.
3154,They're trying to colonize.
3156,"You know, first they get"
3157,"their own bars,"
3159,then they want
3160,equal treatment.
3162,Forget those fags.
3164,Those guys Army-trained?
3166,"A lot of us are, yeah."
3168,Fort Carson myself.
3170," God, I wish I had a scope on this thing."
3171, Never seen those Macs before.
3173, Steve and Jerry?
3174," Yeah, who are they?"
3176,That's classified information.
3178,"Hey, Ron. I want to see"
3179,what you can do
3181, with my.45.
3182, All right.
3184,"Yeah, maybe you'll get"
3185,that nigger next time.
3187,Ooh.
3189,Fifty bucks?
3191, You got it.
3192, I'll take that bet.
3194,"Fuck, how about ten?"
3196, Son of a bitch!
3197," All right, where's my money?"
3199, Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
3200, Not bad. Hot damn.
3202,"Well, my old man bought me"
3203,"a toy cap gun when I was a kid,"
3205,and been shooting ever since.
3207, That's a hell of a cap gun.
3208, He can shoot.
3210," All right, let's go."
3211, Damn.
3213,Pack it up.
3215,"Ron Stallworth,"
3216,motherfucker.
3218,"Hey, Walter."
3220,"Hey, I'm better"
3221,"than I used to be, right?"
3223, I'm gooder than I was.
3224, You're definitely doing
3226,"a little bit better,"
3227,"but I don't think ""gooder"" is a word,"
3229,but you're doing real good.
3231,And Bernie Casey.
3233, Ooh. Bernie Casey.
3234, Brother's strong.
3236,But Cleopatra Jones is the one.
3238,It's about time we started
3239,seeing a strong sister like that.
3241,"Well, Tamara Dobson"
3242,"did play a cop, right?"
3244,"It's a black exploitation film,"
3245,which is a fantasy.
3247,Real life's not like that.
3249,Real life is no Cleopatra Jones
3250,or Coffy.
3252,"What,"
3253,you don't dig Pam Grier?
3255,She's fine as red wine
3256,and twice as mellow.
3258,Pam Grier
3259,"is doing her thing,"
3261,"but in real life, it's just"
3262,pigs killing black folks.
3264,What if there was a cop
3265,trying to change that?
3267,From inside?
3269,"Yes, from inside."
3271,You can't change things from the inside.
3272,It's a racist system.
3274, You just give up like that?
3275, No.
3277,We fight for
3278,"what black people really need,"
3280, black liberation.
3281," Right, right."
3283," So, can't you do that from the inside?"
3284," No, you can't."
3286,The white man won't give up
3287,his position in power without a struggle.
3289,What did Du Bois say
3290,about double consciousness?
3292,Twoness?
3293,Being an American and a Negro?
3295,Two warring ideals
3296,inside one dark body.
3298,"That's heavy, Patrice."
3300,"I feel that,"
3302,like I'm two people
3303,all the time.
3305,But you shouldn't
3306,have to be.
3308,We shouldn't have a war
3309,going on inside ourselves.
3311,We should just be black.
3313,We're not there
3314,"yet, though."
3316,"Well, I'm tired"
3317,of waiting.
3319,I got a serious
3320,question for you.
3322," Oh, yeah? What?"
3323, Very serious.
3325,Uh-huh.
3327,Shaft or Super Fly?
3329, What?
3330, Pick one.
3332,A private detective over
3333,a pimp any day and twice on Sundays.
3335,All right.
3337,Ron O'Neal
3338,or Richard Roundtree?
3340,Richard Roundtree.
3341,Pimps ain't heroes.
3343,"Well, Ron O'Neal isn't a pimp,"
3344,although he played the hell out of one.
3346,That image
3347,does damage to our people.
3349,"Geez, it's a movie."
3350,Give it a rest.
3352,I can't let it rest.
3354,You jive turkey.
3356," Who you calling jive turkey, jive turkey?"
3357, I'm calling you a jive turkey.
3359,I got a Tamara roundhouse coming.
3361, Jive turkey.
3362, It's coming.
3364, It's coming around.
3365, Get out of here with that!
3367,Jive turkey.
3369,Wrong address.
3371,"Sorry to bother you, sir."
3373,Have a good night.
3375,Hello?
3377,Hey.
3379,"Sorry, had to work late."
3381,How are you guys doing?
3383,"Got a beer for you,"
3384,Mr. Stallworth.
3386, Thanks.
3387, You got a twin.
3389, What?
3390, You got a twin.
3392,Twin what?
3394,A twin twin.
3396,And your twin is a nigger.
3398,Looked in the phone book.
3400,Went over to what
3401,I thought was his place.
3403,I found a nig there.
3405,"Well, my number's unlisted."
3407,What address did you go to?
3409,Over on Bluestem Lane.
3411,Bluestem Lane?
3412,"No, I live on 21st Street."
3414,What'd I tell you? Hmm?
3415,Nothing to worry about.
3417,"So, you don't know"
3418,that nigger?
3420,Oh! That's that nigger
3421,I keep in the woodpile.
3423,You're right. I thought
3424,you were talking about somebody else.
3426,"No, I don't."
3428,1813 South 21st Street.
3430,Come by sometime.
3431,We'll have a beer.
3433,And you know what?
3435,That loudmouth
3436,Black Student Union bitch
3438,that's been in the papers
3439,"complaining about the police,"
3441,she was there.
3443,That fucking cunt?
3445,Like to close those
3446,monkey lips permanently.
3448,"Hey, don't say that."
3450,Not until I get her lips
3451,around the head of my dick.
3453,Can we play some goddamn poker now?
3454,Are you done?
3456,"Ron Stallworth, you enter."
3457,You entertain me.
3459,Entertain me a lot more
3461,"than that one-eyed nigger,"
3462,"Sammy Davis, Jr."
3464,"I'll say that, though."
3466,They can dance.
3467,They can dance.
3469,I'll give them that.
3471,About all
3472,I'll fucking give them.
3474,We've got active-duty soldiers
3475,from Fort Carson.
3477,Going to CID with that.
3479,"Two mystery boys,"
3480,Steve and Jerry.
3482,Those are those fishy Army guys
3483,I was telling you about.
3485,Old Klan crew.
3487,Felix's old Klan crew.
3488,Your buddy.
3490,New Klan Walter.
3492,Walter's a general
3493,without an army.
3495,Felix's crew is stronger
3496,than his.
3498,"Oh. Of course,"
3499,"Felix's wife, Connie."
3501,It's crazy you've been
3502,talking to David Duke.
3504,My ace boon coon
3505,running partner.
3507,Now that
3508,"we got this, though,"
3510,"Ronny boy, I'm telling you,"
3511,"we're on a roll, baby."
3513,This is it.
3515, Holy shit.
3516, Yeah.
3518,"""Ron Stallworth, member"
3519,in good standing for the year.
3521,"""Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."""
3523,That's us.
3524,Stallworth Brothers.
3526,"Yeah, well, you don't have"
3527,"that little psychopath, Felix,"
3529,"staring at you,"
3530,asking where you live.
3532,"I'm Jewish, yes,"
3533,but I wasn't raised to be.
3535,It wasn't part of my life.
3537,I never thought much about being Jewish.
3538,Nobody around me was Jewish.
3540,"You know, I wasn't going"
3541,to a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs.
3543,I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.
3545,I was just
3546,another white kid.
3548,And now I'm in some basement
3549,denying it out loud.
3551,I never thought much about it.
3552,Now I'm thinking about it all the time.
3554,About
3555,rituals and heritage.
3557,Is that passing?
3559,"Well, then I have"
3560,been passing.
3562,I don't want that.
3564,It sounds like
3565,they're watching us.
3567,I don't know.
3568,I was asleep. I don't know.
3570,I don't know what
3571,we're supposed to do.
3573,Look at this bullshit.
3575,Where'd you find these?
3577,Plastered all over
3578,"my windshield,"
3580,but they're all over
3581,"the neighborhood, too."
3583,Is this real?
3585,Real as can be.
3587,Intimidation?
3589,"Clearly, this is about"
3590,the Black Student Union and you.
3592, Me?
3593," Well, you've been outspoken"
3595,about the incident with the police
3596,when Brother Kwame was here.
3598,"So, next, they'll have"
3599,a burning cross out front?
3601,"All right,"
3602,they're just trying to get to you.
3604,"Intimidate, like you said."
3605,Fear tactics.
3607,"If you don't let 'em scare you,"
3608,they got nothing.
3610,But keep your eyes open.
3611,"Be cool, okay?"
3613,That's the damn problem.
3615,We always too cool.
3617,Way too cool.
3619,"Well, maybe we should"
3620,call the police.
3622,How we know this ain't some of the KKK's
3623,honky-pig partners passing out this shit?
3625,Let me ask you.
3626,Excuse us.
3628, Let me ask you something.
3629, Excuse us for what?
3631,"""Cool."" Want me to be cool?"
3632,I'll be cool.
3634,And it also safeguards against
3635,"the CSPD, which is nice."
3637,Yeah.
3639,"Yeah, you soak"
3640,the wood in kerosene
3642,and light a cig
3643,on a pack of matches.
3645,It kind of buys you some time
3646,to get the fuck out
3648,before the cross
3649,catches fire.
3651,Yeah.
3653,Must be quite a sight.
3655,"Oh, yeah, it is."
3657,It's great.
3658,It's a real bonfire.
3660,"You can see it from miles away,"
3661,you know?
3663,"Good visibility,"
3664,as Walter would say.
3666,"Freaks out the Jew media,"
3667,"and it,"
3669,"well, it keeps niggers"
3670,on their nigger toes.
3672,"Oh, look at that. Damn,"
3673,there's another one.
3675,The pigs are out
3676,"tonight, yeah."
3678,Good job. Send another one.
3680,Lot of these guys
3681,in the Army?
3683,We got a couple.
3685,We got a few
3686,"on active duty, yeah."
3688,I just finished
3689,my second tour in 'Nam.
3691, No shit.
3692, Yeah.
3694,My guy.
3696,"Hey, Ron, do you happen"
3697,to know anything about C-4?
3699,You being in
3700,the military and all?
3702,Enough to make
3703,shit blow up.
3705,.program dares
3706,"to love white people,"
3708,white heritage
3709,and white freedom.
3711,This program also
3712,dares to expose
3714, the Jewish supremacism.
3715, Here come my boys.
3717,Here come the cavalry.
3719,.and the criminal banking
3720,establishment.
3722,"These criminal bankers,"
3723,"the criminal Fed,"
3725,the establishment is.
3727,They're ethnically
3728,"cleansing our people,"
3730,not only in the United States.
3732,Not only in the United States.
3734,The only thing that
3735,we hear today from politicians.
3737,"You all, cross burning is off."
3738,"Too many cops, God damn it."
3740,"""Right, thank you, black people."
3741,"I love black people."""
3743,"And, of course, every"
3744,"politician, every politician"
3746,has to talk and genuflect to
3747,"the real rulers of our society and say,"
3749,"""I want to thank"
3750,the Jewish people.
3752,"""I love the Jewish people."
3754,"""The Jewish people"
3755,are always our friends
3757,"""no matter what they do,"
3759,"""no matter how much"
3760,they destroy our country.
3762,"""It's just wonderful."
3763,"You know, we just love the Jews."""
3765,And no senator or congressman
3767,"would dare get up and say,"
3768,"""I love white people."
3770,"""I love white heritage."
3772,"""I love my people,"
3773,and I love the culture
3775,"""that was created in Europe."
3777,"""And this great Western,"
3778,Christian civilization.
3780,"""I want to see that persevere."
3782,"""You know, I want to see"
3783,"that be enriched."""
3785,A lot of people think
3786,"I hate Negroes, but I don't."
3788,And the Organization
3789,"doesn't, either."
3791,They just need to be
3792,with their own.
3794,That's what Pinky would say.
3796,Pinky didn't mind
3797,segregation one bit.
3799,She just wanted to be
3800,with her own kind.
3802,Sounds like she was
3803,a Mammy to you.
3805,You ever seen
3806,Gone with the Wind?
3808,Pinky was my
3809,Hattie McDaniel.
3811,She won the Oscar
3812,for that role.
3814,"You know,"
3815,"Best Supporting Actress, so."
3817,"You were Scarlett,"
3818,and she was Mammy.
3820,That's right.
3822, Right.
3823, That's funny.
3825,"When she passed,"
3826,it was like.
3828,"Well, it was like we lost"
3829,a member of the family.
3831,A good nigger
3832,is funny like that.
3834,"In that sense,"
3835,they're like a good dog.
3837,"They get real close to you,"
3838,"and as soon as you lose them,"
3840,it just breaks your heart.
3842,"That's well said, Ron."
3844, I knew a coon once.
3845, Did you?
3847,"Yeah, that Negro lived"
3848,across the street from us.
3850,I must have been
3851,six or seven.
3853,His nickname
3854,was Butter Biscuit.
3856,How'd he get
3857,that nickname?
3859,He loved his mama's
3860,butter biscuits.
3862,"Yum, yum."
3864,Me and Butter Biscuit
3865,played together every day.
3867,"One day, my father"
3868,came home early from work.
3870,He told me I couldn't play
3871,with that little spook anymore
3873,because I was white
3875,and Butter Biscuit
3876,was a nigger.
3878,That's so rich.
3880,"Well, your father sounds"
3881,like a terrific man.
3883,He was a true American.
3885,Taught me what was right.
3887,This is why we need
3888,more people like you and me
3890,in public office.
3891,Get this country back on track.
3893,Amen.
3895,For America
3896,to achieve its.
3898,"Uh, its greatness again."
3900,Absolutely.
3902,"Boy, I sure wish we had"
3903,a chance to chat face-to-face.
3905,"In due time, my friend."
3907,"In due time, I will be"
3908,in Colorado Springs
3910,for your initiation.
3912,You're coming
3913,"to Colorado Springs, sir?"
3915,You bet
3916,your Mayflower Society ass I am.
3918,You're darn tooting.
3920,"All right, I pulled"
3921,the materials that you asked for.
3923, Okay.
3924, So you just move it around
3926,like this to see the images.
3928,"Once you try it,"
3929,I think you'll get the hang of it.
3931, Okay? Got it?
3932, Thank you.
3934,"Okay, I'll be at the desk"
3935,if you need anything.
3937,Okay. Thank you.
3939,Thanks for getting
3940,back to me.
3942,"Listen, I think we need"
3943,a new leader.
3945,Someone everyone
3946,can unite behind.
3948,I just don't think
3949,I'm gonna carry the votes.
3951,Felix would love
3952,"to be the one,"
3954,but I can't let that happen.
3956,He's a crazy son of a bitch.
3958,Goddamn loose cannon.
3960,"No, we need"
3961,"someone articulate,"
3963,someone. Someone who displays
3964,real leadership qualities.
3966,And I think it should be you.
3968,I gotta think about this.
3970,"My father, he's sick,"
3971,and he lives in El Paso.
3973,I don't know
3974,if I can handle both.
3976,Sorry to hear that.
3978,Think about it.
3980,You're a smart
3981,"and diligent man,"
3983,and I've got no doubt
3984,that you could handle it.
3986,I think it's time
3987,we get some new blood in here.
3989, Yeah?
3990, New ideas.
3992,"For that reason,"
3994,I'm planning to step down
3995,as your president.
3997,But I would like to make
3998,a nomination.
4000,Mr. Ron Stallworth
4001,for chapter president.
4003,We just met this guy.
4005,He just walked in
4006,off the street.
4008,Let me ask a question.
4010,Is there anybody here who's willing to
4011,put their neck on the line for Ron?
4013,I'll vouch for Ron.
4015,You know who else
4016,vouches for Ron?
4018,Mr. Duke.
4020,"Look, it's a big honor,"
4021,but I. I can't accept.
4023,"The trouble is, what you good men need is"
4024,a president who will be constant.
4026,"On call day in, day out."
4028,My old man is sick.
4029,I just found out.
4031,So I'm going to be back
4032,and forth between here and Dallas.
4034,"El Paso, Flip, El Paso!"
4036,Thought it was El Paso.
4038,It is. What did I say?
4040, Dallas.
4041," Which one is it, Ron?"
4043,Make up your mind.
4045,Dallas is where the layover is.
4046,El Paso is where my father is.
4048,"Dallas, that's where"
4049,"they killed that nigger lover, Kennedy."
4051,Where you learned that?
4053,I can read. I can.
4055,"Well, we'll pray"
4056,for your pop's health.
4058,It's him.
4060,"Hey, Ron,"
4061,I don't share this
4063," with a lot of people, but."
4064, Yeah.
4066,"Well, I'm anxious"
4067,to meet you.
4069,Excited to meet
4070,"you, too, Ron."
4072,Aren't you ever concerned of
4073,"some smart-aleck nigger calling you,"
4075,pretending to be white?
4077,No. I can always tell
4078,when I'm talking to a Negro.
4080,How so?
4082,"Take you, for example, Ron."
4084,Me?
4086,Yeah.
4088,"I mean, I can tell"
4089,that you're a
4091,pure Aryan white man from
4092,the way you pronounce certain words.
4094,Can you give me
4095,any examples?
4097,"Yeah, take the word ""are."""
4099,Pure Aryan like you or I would
4100,"pronounce it correctly. ""Are."""
4102,"Negro pronounces it ""are-uh."""
4104,Did you ever notice that?
4105,"It's like, ""Are-uh"
4107,"""you gonna fry up that"
4109,"""crispy fried chicken,"
4110,"soul brother?"""
4112,You know?
4114,Sorry.
4116,Wow.
4118,You are so white.
4119,Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
4121,"If you had not brought it to my attention,"
4122,I wouldn't have noticed the difference
4124,between how we talk
4125,and how Negroes talk.
4127,"Good, good."
4129,Yeah.
4131,I'd love to continue
4132,this conversation in Colorado Springs.
4134,"It's beautiful here,"
4135,sir. God's country.
4137,"Well, that's"
4138,"what I hear, Ron."
4140,I look forward
4141,"to meeting you,"
4143,"and, uh, we'll be"
4144,talking real soon.
4146,God bless White America.
4148,Come back.
4150," Oh, my God."
4151, Who are you giving the finger?
4153,Hello?
4155,It's Felix.
4157,Catch you at a bad time?
4159,"No, not at all."
4160,I'm just finishing a meal.
4162,"Meeting, my house. Now."
4164,"Ron, get your ass in gear."
4166,And don't tell
4167,mealymouth Walter.
4169,Welcome to the promised land.
4171,"In about a week's time,"
4173,we'll be welcoming
4174,Mr. David Duke to our city.
4176," Oh, yeah."
4177, Who's packing tonight?
4179,I'm packing.
4181,Amen.
4183,"Where's your piece, Ron?"
4185,"Well, you know,"
4186,I don't carry it on me all the time.
4188,"""Don't carry."""
4190,"No, that."
4192,I got you covered.
4194,Won't happen again.
4196,We're gonna need
4197,your good shot come next Sunday.
4199,Why? What's next Sunday?
4201,The war is gonna
4202,come to us.
4204,"Well, fuck yeah."
4206,Looks like we got ourselves
4207,another soldier.
4209,Just make sure
4210,"that when you're at the steakhouse,"
4212,you got your new
4213,friend with you.
4215,"And, Ron, you're gonna"
4216,want to name your piece.
4218,This is Betsey.
4220, Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.
4221, I'm sorry.
4223,Don't fucking point the gun
4224,at anybody ever.
4226,I know what I'm doing.
4227,I know how to use this thing.
4229, Honey. Do you ever have second thoughts?
4230, Mmm-hmm.
4232,About what?
4234,Killing them.
4236,Never think twice
4237,about killing niggers.
4239,You won't be able to
4240,"take it back, though."
4242,They're the first
4243,of many niggers
4245," that must die, honey bun."
4246, I know. It's just
4248,becoming so real.
4249,I always thought it would be like a dream.
4251,I know.
4253,It's just so beautiful.
4255,We're cleansing this country of
4256,a backwards race of chimpanzees.
4258,First the spooks.
4260,Then the kikes.
4262,"Free at last,"
4263,free at last.
4265,"Thank God Almighty,"
4267,free of them
4268,niggers at last.
4270,I love it when you
4271,"do that, honey."
4273,Mmm.
4275,We've talked about killing
4276,"niggers for so many years,"
4278,and now it's
4279,really happening.
4281,Hmm.
4283,My old man always told me good
4284,things come to those who wait.
4286,Mmm.
4288,Thank you for
4289,bringing me into your life.
4291,For loving me like you do.
4293,For giving me
4294,"a purpose, direction."
4296,This could be
4297,the new Boston Tea Party.
4299,Mmm.
4301,Mr. Stallworth.
4303,Pleased to meet you.
4305,Names of chapter members?
4307,What is this about?
4309,Two names on your list
4310,work at NORAD.
4312,"The two mystery men,"
4313,Steve and Jerry?
4315,Real names are Harry Dricks
4316,and Kevin Nelson.
4318,Two clowns with
4319,top security clearances.
4321,These Klansmen are in charge
4322,of monitoring our safety.
4324,You've done a service
4325,to your country.
4327,We've been following
4328,your investigation.
4330,Impressive.
4332,"Last night,"
4333,Fort Carson reported
4335,several C-4 explosives
4336,missing from their armory.
4338, No suspects.
4339, Klan?
4341,"Wait, the KKK"
4342,and the United States Army?
4344,You won't see this
4345,"on the news for obvious reasons,"
4347,but thought it might be
4348,of interest to you.
4350,If you know about a possible
4351,"attack, I need to know when."
4353,You're the one with
4354,the impressive investigation.
4356,But can't you
4357,or the FBI chip in?
4359,Sir?
4361,FBI?
4363,Federal Bureau
4364,of Investigation?
4366,We never had
4367,this conversation.
4369,You can hate me
4370,"all you want, all right?"
4372,Just promise me
4373,you won't go to that protest.
4375,I'm going. We're going.
4377,What are you
4378,talking about?
4380,"I can't get into specifics,"
4381,but today the Klan is planning an attack.
4383, Then we have to tell the people.
4384, It's not an option.
4386,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4388,What's wrong with you?
4390,No one else can know
4391,while it's an active investigation.
4393,Active investigation?
4394,"And pray tell, how do you know that?"
4396,Are you a pig?
4398, No.
4399," What are you, then?"
4401,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4403,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4404,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4406,Want to sit?
4408,No. I'll stand.
4410,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4411,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4413,I'm an undercover detective.
4415,I'm investigating the Klan.
4417,Fucking KKK?
4419,"Ron Stallworth, you lied to me."
4420,Is that even your real name?
4422,Ron Stallworth
4423,is my first and last name.
4425,"Look, today"
4426,"is not the day, Patrice."
4428,I take my duties
4429,as the president of
4431,the Black Student
4432,Union seriously.
4434,"Well, how much"
4435,good did it do?
4437,You could sit in the middle
4438,"of Nevada Avenue,"
4440,"light yourself on fire,"
4441,the KKK will still be here.
4443,"Well, at least I would be"
4444,"doing something, unlike you."
4446, Unlike me?
4447, Yeah.
4449,"Don't think, just because"
4450,I don't wear a black beret
4452,"or a black leather jacket,"
4453,"black Ray-Bans,"
4455,"screaming, ""Kill Whitey,"""
4456,that I don't care about my people.
4458,The night we saw
4459,"Brother Kwame speak,"
4461,were you undercover
4462,"then, too?"
4464,That's not fair.
4466, You have to understand.
4467, Answer the question.
4469,Were you undercover
4470,the night we met? Yes or no?
4472,"Ron Stallworth, are you for the revolution"
4473,and the liberation of black people?
4475,I'm an undercover detective
4476,for the Colorado Springs Police.
4478,It's my J-O-B.
4479,That's the truth.
4481,House niggers said
4482,"they had a J-O-B, too."
4484,You disgust me.
4486,"My brother,"
4487,you need to wake up.
4489,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4490,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4492,Are you
4493,fucking kidding me?
4495,You don't cross those lines.
4497,"This is about an investigation,"
4498,not a relationship.
4500,Hate to break that
4501,blue wall of silence.
4503,Nice one.
4505, Is Patrice really in danger?
4506, Maybe.
4508,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4510,"Ungawa, Black Power!"
4512,It's off.
4514,Yep.
4516,You'll know soon enough.
4518,What?
4520,Felix just said the march
4521,has been canceled.
4523, Why?
4524, Could be all the death threats.
4526,"No, they're"
4527,used to that.
4529,And there's been
4530,nothing more about the explosives?
4532,No.
4534,Fuck it.
4536,We get them
4537,on weapons charges
4539,and stop them from doing
4540,anything that way.
4542,"Then what? You know,"
4543,misdemeanor at best.
4545, Then they walk.
4546, I have a special assignment for Ron.
4548,Ron already
4549,has an assignment.
4551,"Yeah, what could be more important"
4552,"than preventing an attack, sir?"
4554,We have very credible threats
4555,against David Duke's life.
4557,"So, Ron, I am assigning"
4558,you security detail
4560, for David Duke.
4561, What?
4563,"With all due respect,"
4564,"sir, I don't think"
4566,"this is a wise decision,"
4567,given the situation.
4569,Who cares what you think?
4570,Duke needs protection.
4572,There's no one
4573,else available.
4575,Nut-cracking time.
4577,Put aside your
4578,personal politics.
4580,"Chief, it's not about that,"
4581,and you know it.
4583,David Duke and Ron have been
4584,talking on the phone several times.
4586,If he recognizes his voice.
4588,"If any of the Klansmen do,"
4589,it'll compromise our entire investigation.
4591, It's too dangerous.
4592," Correct me if I'm wrong,"
4594,but didn't you boast to me
4595,that you were fluent
4597,in both English and jive?
4599, Do you remember that?
4600, Answer the Chief.
4602,"Oh, shut the fuck up,"
4603,Landers.
4605,"You know, you've been trying"
4606,to sabotage me since day one.
4608,Why are you getting
4609,"so worked up, boy?"
4611," Hey, Ron!"
4612," Hey, Ron, come on."
4614," Ron, Ron, no! Ron!"
4615, It's not worth it.
4617," Okay, okay, all right."
4618, Just.
4620," Go, go, go."
4621, Stay put.
4623," Ron. Whoa, whoa!"
4624, What the fuck is that?
4626,Gotta bring something
4627,"to get something, Landers."
4629,Eat a white dick!
4631,You let him get
4632,to you that easy?
4634,You don't have
4635,a shot with David Duke.
4637,"First, the primary target."
4639,Felix says
4640,you're doing it.
4642,So all you have to do is
4643,"set the pocketbook on the front porch,"
4645,"the back porch, a sidewalk."
4646,Doesn't matter.
4648,"As long as it's against the building,"
4649,you can plant it anywhere.
4651,I got enough C-4 here
4652,to take out the whole thing.
4654,Be careful.
4656, You understand?
4657, I understand.
4659,All you have to do
4660,when you placed it.
4662,"Hey, sweetie. You listening?"
4663,All you have to do
4665,when you placed it
4666,is flip the switch.
4668,Flip the switch.
4669,That's it.
4671,You got it?
4673,Miss Black Student
4674,Union Bitch
4676,is bringing in some
4677,old coon to speak.
4679,Place should be packed.
4681,"So, Brother Walker,"
4682,nothing but rubble.
4684,And barbecued niggers.
4686, And what happens if that don't work?
4687, Plan B.
4689,Can you
4690,"handle it, honey?"
4692,You can count on me.
4694,I've been waiting
4695,to do my part.
4697,Sweet as candy.
4699,"Ah, look"
4700,at the lovebirds.
4702,Can I feel the C-4?
4704,No C-4 for you.
4706,You'll blow us all the fuck up
4707,to kingdom come.
4709, What is this black.
4710, Out here with
4712, the great David Duke.
4713, Look at this fucking guy.
4715,How's he getting
4716,away with that?
4718,Mr. Duke's security detail.
4720, What?
4721, Fuck this guy.
4723,Mr. Duke.
4724,I'm a detective
4726,from the Colorado Springs
4727,Police Department.
4729,I'm here to keep
4730,you safe today.
4732," I'm sorry, have we met before?"
4733, Mmm-mmm.
4735,You may know that there's several credible
4736,threats against your life.
4738,How's it going out here?
4740,There have been
4741,"threats on my life,"
4743,and this is the detective
4744,they've assigned as my bodyguard.
4746,"Mr. Duke, I don't agree"
4747,with your philosophies.
4749,"However,"
4750,"I'm a professional,"
4752,so I will do everything
4753,within my means and beyond
4755, to make sure you're safe.
4756," Okay, I appreciate your professionalism."
4758,"Allow me, sir."
4760,Thank you.
4762," Right this way, sir."
4763, Walt.
4765, Bro. How are you?
4766, Sir.
4768,Sorry for all
4769,the extra security today.
4771,Can't be too careful.
4773,"Yeah, I know."
4774,"We have a strong, strong."
4776,"Hey, fellas."
4778,"Yeah, like you were saying,"
4779,last week on the phone.
4781,"Well, Mr. Duke."
4783,I would like you to meet
4784,"our newest recruit,"
4786,Ron Stallworth.
4788,"Ron Stallworth, it is a pleasure to"
4789,finally meet you in person.
4791,Same. Same.
4792,You as well.
4794,"This is our brother, Jesse."
4796, I'm Jesse.
4797," Hey, Jesse."
4799, Ron.
4800," Ron, yeah."
4802, I've heard so much about you.
4803," Oh, okay."
4805,I didn't realize how nervous
4806,I was gonna be.
4808,That's all right.
4810,What's that doing here?
4812,That's the fucking cop
4813,they got to guard Mr. Duke.
4815,Isn't that the living shit?
4817,"Gentlemen, it's time."
4819," Ron, why don't you follow me?"
4820, Okay.
4822,Let's go. Let's go.
4824,You stay right here.
4826,You hear?
4828,"God, America's going to hell"
4829,in a handbasket.
4831,That started out
4832,as a nice spring day
4834,"back there in Waco, Texas."
4836,"May 15, 1916."
4838,Jesse Washington.
4840,Was a friend of mine.
4842,He was 17.
4844,I was 18.
4846,We kind of looked at Jesse
4847,and called him slow.
4849,"Today,"
4851,you'd call him
4852,mentally retarded.
4854,They claimed Jesse
4856,raped and murdered
4857,a white woman
4859,by the name of Lucy Fryer.
4861,"They put Jesse on trial,"
4863,and he was convicted
4864,by an all-white jury
4866,after they deliberated
4867,for only four minutes.
4869,"My brothers in Christ,"
4871,"Nobel Prize recipient,"
4873,co-creator of the transistor
4874,"and a dear, dear friend of mine,"
4876,"Dr. William Shockley,"
4878,whose groundbreaking scientific work
4879,"ushered in the computer age,"
4881,"has proven,"
4882,"through his research with eugenics,"
4884,that each of us here
4885,has flowing through our veins
4887,the genes
4888,of a superior race.
4890,It's a fact.
4892,It's a fact.
4893,It can't be disputed.
4895,"Today, we"
4896,celebrate that truth.
4898,"Masks off, hoods on."
4900,I was working across the street
4901,at the shoeshine parlor.
4903,"And after the verdict,"
4905,"a mob grabbed Jesse,"
4907,put a chain around his neck
4908,and dragged him out of the courthouse.
4910,"Oh, my God."
4912,I knew I had to hide.
4914,That way.
4916,"Be careful, brother."
4918,"Well, all right."
4920,"Where I was,"
4921,the shoe parlor
4923,had a window
4924,up in the attic.
4926,And I could see the crowd.
4928,They marched Jesse
4929,through the streets.
4931,They stabbed him
4932,and beat him.
4934,Oh!
4936,"And finally,"
4937,"in a bloody heap,"
4939,they held him down
4940,in the street
4942,and cut off his testicles.
4944,"God,"
4946,give us true white men.
4948,The Invisible Empire
4949,"demands strong minds,"
4951,"great hearts, true faith,"
4953,clean and ready hands.
4955,Men who have honor.
4957,Men who will not lie.
4959,Men who can stand
4960,before a demagogue
4962,and damn his treacherous
4963,flatteries without blinking.
4965,"God, give us real men."
4967,Courageous men who
4968,flinch not at duty.
4970,"Men of dependable character,"
4971,men of sterling worth.
4973,"Then wrongs will be redressed,"
4974,and right shall rule the Earth.
4976,"God, give us"
4977,true white men.
4979,Ron Stallworth.
4981,Rise.
4983,Step forward.
4985,The police
4986,and the city officials
4988,were out there
4989,watching him.
4991, They cut off his fingers.
4992, Oh!
4994,And threw coal oil
4995,all over his body.
4997,They lit a bonfire
4999,and raised him
5000,and lowered him
5002,over these flames
5004,over and over
5005,and over again.
5007,"Ron Stallworth,"
5009,"are you a white,"
5010,non-Jewish American citizen?
5012,Yes.
5014,Yes what?
5016,"Yes, I am a white,"
5018,non-Jewish
5019,American citizen.
5021,Are you in favor of
5022,a white man's government
5024, in this country?
5025, Yes.
5027,"Ron Stallworth,"
5028,are you willing to dedicate your life
5030,"to the protection,"
5031,the preservation
5033,and the advancement
5034,of the white race
5036,"in mind, in body"
5038, and in spirit?
5039, Yes.
5041,Be seated.
5043,The mayor had a photographer
5044,by the name of Gildersleeve.
5046,He came and took pictures
5047,of the whole thing.
5049,Those pictures were later
5050,sold as postcards.
5052,Remove your hood.
5054,They put Jesse's
5055,charred body into a bag.
5057,Remove your hood.
5059,Dragged him
5060,through town.
5062,Remove your hood.
5064,They sold the remains.
5066,Remove your hood.
5068,As souvenirs.
5070,Remove your hood.
5072,Lot of good
5073,white folks just stood there
5075,like it was
5076,a Fourth of July parade.
5078,They even let the children
5079,out of school
5081,on lunch hour.
5083,Remove your hood.
5085,And all
5086,I could do was to
5088,watch and hope
5090,they wouldn't find me.
5092,Come.
5094,Welcome your brethren
5096,who have been
5097,baptized by the light.
5099, Please.
5100," Oh, my God!"
5102,Let's give them
5103,some applause!
5105,One of the reasons they had
5106,done that to Jesse was a movie
5108,called Birth of a Nation.
5110,It had come out
5111,"the year before,"
5113,and it was so powerful
5115,that it gave
5116,the Ku Klux Klan a rebirth.
5118,"Oh, God. Oh, my God."
5120,"Oh, my God. No!"
5122,No!
5124,"Oh, look at that one!"
5126,"Oh, he's disgusting."
5128,Oh!
5130,"Oh, those poor women."
5132,Don't you do it!
5134, Why?
5135, No.
5137,No.
5139,The ingenuity
5140,of white women!
5142,"Today, they would call that"
5143,kind of movie a blockbuster.
5145,Everybody saw it.
5147,That's disgusting.
5149,Even the president
5150,"of the United States,"
5152,"Woodrow Wilson,"
5153,showed it at the White House.
5155,"And he said that it was ""history"
5156,"written with lightning."""
5158,What. What is really.
5160,"Oh, look at that"
5161,little pickaninny.
5163,"Watch, watch. They're gonna"
5164,scare the pickaninnies.
5166,Get out of there!
5168, Move. Move.
5169, Get out of there!
5171,The inspiration!
5173,Get 'em out of there!
5175, Go get 'em!
5176, Go!
5178,Go get 'em!
5180,Hey!
5182, Send him to hell!
5183, String him up!
5185,String him up!
5187,Guilty!
5189,Get him on that horse.
5191,Get him up!
5192,String him up!
5194,Yeah!
5196,White power!
5197,White power! White power!
5199,That's why
5200,we're here today.
5202,In the name
5203,of Black Power.
5205, Yes.
5206, Black Power. Black Power.
5208,Black Power! Black Power!
5210,Black Power! Black Power!
5211,Black Power!
5213,I'd like you to do me a favor
5214,and just look around.
5216,That's right.
5217,Everyone just look around.
5219,"Today, we are privileged"
5220,to be among white men.
5222,And white women.
5224,Such as yourselves.
5226,Real warriors.
5228,For the real America.
5230,The America that our ancestors
5231,fought and died for.
5233,The true white
5234,American race.
5236,The backbone from whence came
5237,our great Southern heritage.
5239,And I want to thank you.
5241,Jesus Christ.
5243,I want to
5244,thank you so much
5246,for never putting
5247,your country second.
5249, That's right.
5250, Hmm.
5252, America first.
5253, America first.
5255,America first.
5257,America first!
5258,America first!
5260,Ain't this a bitch.
5262,If I would have known
5263,"this was a Klan meeting,"
5265,I wouldn't have taken
5266,this motherfucking gig.
5268,Goddamn.
5270,"Right on, right on."
5272,"All right, now, when are you boys"
5273,gonna invite me down to Louisiana?
5275,We'd certainly
5276,love to have you.
5278,Still a lot of work to be done.
5279,"I mean, you've done"
5281,a great job whipping up
5282,"this chapter, but."
5284,"Well, I could do a great job"
5285,on a national level.
5287,Excuse me.
5289,"Walter, may I?"
5291,Behave yourself.
5293,"Mr. Duke, I just"
5294,want to say how
5296,"honored my wife, Connie,"
5297,and I are for being in your presence.
5299,"What's your name, friend?"
5301,Felix.
5303,"Felix, the pleasure's"
5304,all mine.
5306,We'd love to have you out to
5307,the house for dinner sometime.
5309,We Coloradans can cook just as good
5310,as those Cajun ladies you got down there.
5312,"All right, now, Connie."
5314,We're on a very
5315,"tight schedule here,"
5317,but you made a mistake.
5319,"Next time I'm in town,"
5320,"I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?"
5322,"Oh, I see Susie."
5324,I'll be back
5325,in just a second.
5327,Hey.
5329,Thank you.
5330,Thank you very much.
5332, Is this your wife?
5333, Yep.
5335, Hey. Ron. How are you?
5336, Hi.
5338,Nice to meet you.
5340,Never seen you
5341,dressed up before.
5343,It's a pleasure
5344,"to meet you, Felix."
5346, You have a fantastic night.
5347," Oh, thank you."
5349,America first.
5351,"Hey, Ron,"
5352,how you doing?
5354," I'm good, I'm good."
5355, Good.
5357, He's a cop.
5358, Who?
5360, That guy.
5361, Ron?
5363," No, the other guy."
5364, Ron's a cop?
5366,"His name is Phillip,"
5367,but his nickname is Flip.
5369, Who's Phillip?
5370, Who's Ron? That's Phillip.
5372, What the fuck are you talking about?
5373, That guy.
5375,That's the cop that sent me
5376,to the fucking big house
5378,for armed fucking robbery.
5380,His fucking name is Phillip.
5381,Phillip Zimmerman.
5383, What's his name?
5384, Phillip Zimmerman.
5386,How many times
5387,I gotta fucking tell you?
5389,Isn't that
5390,a fucking Jew name?
5392,You can't go by that.
5394,Jews change their name
5395,all the time to non-Jew names.
5397,"I mean, they killed"
5398,"Jesus, right?"
5400,Ron Stallworth
5401,is a fucking Jew.
5403,Could've been worse.
5405,How so?
5407,Could've been a nigger.
5409,Yeah.
5411,They built
5412,this stuff out of.
5414,It starts to dissolve.
5415,"It wasn't water, you know."
5417,The beads take the.
5419,He is a nigger.
5421,Who?
5423,That cop guarding Duke.
5425,Zimmerman's
5426,using his name.
5428,I guess
5429,I could use mops.
5431, Shall we tell the grand wizard?
5432," No, no, no. Not yet."
5434,I'll find the moment.
5436,Okay.
5438,Fucking Jew.
5440,"Yeah, I know. We have"
5441,a strong future in America.
5443,I'm so glad
5444,I made this trip.
5446, With all these chapters.
5447," Well, that's what we"
5449, have to work on.
5450," Excuse me, gentlemen."
5452,Hi.
5454,"Mr. Duke,"
5456,favor to ask.
5458,Nobody's gonna believe me when I tell them
5459,that I was your personal bodyguard today.
5461,Care to take
5462,a Polaroid with me?
5464,I don't know.
5465,Do those cool shades come off?
5467,"Oh, yes, sir, they do."
5469, Okay.
5470, There we go.
5472,"Hey, Jesse. Let's do this."
5473,It'll be right.
5475,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5477, Who should.
5478, What.
5480, What's his name?
5481," Uh, Ron."
5483, Stallworth.
5484," Ron. Ron, sir."
5486,Can you take this
5487,"picture of us, please?"
5489,"All right,"
5490,don't touch me.
5492,Great.
5494, All right.
5495, All right.
5497,Thank you so much.
5498,Thank you.
5500,Here we go. One.
5502,Two. Three.
5504,Jesus H. Christ!
5506,"What did you just do, boy?"
5508,I mean.
5510,What the hell
5511,did you just do?
5513,"Sir, if you lay"
5514,"a finger on me,"
5516,I'll arrest your ass
5517,for assaulting a police officer.
5519,That's worth about
5520,five years in prison.
5522,Try me.
5523,See if I'm playing.
5525,Why don't you come down
5526,to Louisiana sometime?
5528,See how we play.
5530,"Boy, you better get your"
5531,nigger ass out of here now.
5533,Mmm-hmm.
5535,America first.
5537,Excuse me.
5539,May I? Thanks.
5541, You ready?
5542," What, now?"
5544,Don't be nervous.
5546,Okay. I'm leaving.
5548, Remember what we talked about.
5549, Okay.
5551,Come here.
5553,Now you may do your job.
5555, Okay.
5556, Nice and easy does it.
5558,Excuse me.
5560,Excuse me.
5562,"Attention, all units."
5564,Be on the lookout for a brown truck
5565,"with a ""white pride"" bumper sticker."
5567,"License plate, KE4108."
5569,Kills this big rat
5570,in the back of our backyard.
5572,And I actually start to like
5573,the fucking thing for the first time.
5575,"I shit you not,"
5576,"three days later,"
5578,this little Girl Scout
5579,comes to our door.
5581,Ron.
5583,I believe you
5584,know my friend.
5586,Who's your friend?
5588,Hey.
5590,"No, sorry, I don't think we've"
5591,met before. Ron Stallworth.
5593,Yeah? It's been
5594,"a few years, right?"
5596, Been a few years?
5597, Yeah.
5599,"No, I'm sorry."
5600,I don't think I can place you.
5602, Did you two go to school together?
5603, No. I went to private school.
5605,"Leavenworth, Kansas."
5607,Isn't that where
5608,the federal penitentiary is?
5610,"Matter of fact, it is."
5612,You know something
5613,about that.
5615," Don't you, Flip?"
5616, Flip?
5618,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
5620,There is an emergency phone call
5621,in the hallway for a Felix Kendrickson.
5623,"I'll be right back, Flip."
5625,Hello?
5627,Felix.
5629,"Jesus, they've"
5630,got cops everywhere.
5632,Somebody tipped them off.
5634,"Oh, God,"
5635,there's another one!
5637,"Calm down, baby."
5638,"We planned for this, all right?"
5640,"We'll go to plan B, okay?"
5642,"Okay, okay, okay."
5644,"Okay, okay, okay, plan B."
5646,"All right, baby?"
5647,You can do it.
5649,I'll be right there.
5651,All right.
5653,"Remember when you said, one day,"
5654,I'm gonna need your help?
5656,"This is it, baby."
5658,"I love you, honey bun."
5660,I love you.
5662,I can make
5663,America great again.
5665," Oh, yeah."
5666," We need lawyers,"
5668,"we need doctors,"
5669,and we need.
5671,"Excuse me, Mr. Duke."
5673,Let's go.
5675,Good talker.
5676,He's a good talker.
5678,"You'll have to excuse him,"
5679,Mr. Duke. I apologize.
5681,What was that all about?
5683,Why'd he keep
5684,calling you Flip?
5686,We were in prison together.
5688,Years ago.
5690,"Uh, it's an inside joke."
5692,"Well, I certainly hope"
5693,everything's okay.
5695,"Yeah, but I think he may have"
5696,violated his parole.
5698,I just need to use
5699,the restroom real quick.
5701,"Hey, where's Patrice?"
5703,Patrice and Odetta took
5704,Mr. Turner back to his hotel.
5706,Back up. Back up.
5708,Freedom.
5709,It dares to expose the fact
5711,that not only
5712,"is this a country,"
5714,not a white racist country.
5716,It is a racist country.
5718,"Indeed,"
5719,it is a racist country.
5721,It's an anti-white
5722,racist country.
5724,Fuck.
5726,But it's so important.
5728,"Next time, we should work"
5729,on getting a sister in here.
5731,We need to be
5732,hearing their stories.
5734, Yep.
5735, We need to start doing this every week.
5737,I'll reach out and see
5738,who I can get.
5740,Yeah.
5742,Colorado State Police.
5743,Don't move.
5745,"I said stop, damn it!"
5747,No! Help me!
5749,Help me!
5751,"Help me! Help me, please!"
5753,Stop. Stop.
5755, Where'd you put the bomb?
5756, No!
5758,You're hurting me!
5760,Where's the bomb?
5761,Where'd you put it?
5763, Get off me. Get off.
5764, Where is it?
5766, Get off of me!
5767, Hold still. Stay still.
5769, Stay still.
5770, I don't know what you're talking about!
5772, Where's the bomb?
5773, Freeze!
5775,"Get off her,"
5776,or I'll fucking shoot you.
5778, Whoa. Get off her.
5779, Okay. All right.
5781, Easy.
5782, I'm undercover.
5784, He's got a gun!
5785, I'm a cop!
5787, He touched me.
5788, She's a terrorist.
5790,That nigger attacked me.
5792,He tried to rape me.
5793,Arrest him.
5795, I'm an undercover cop!
5796, Show us your badge.
5798," It's in my pocket, okay?"
5799, What are you waiting for?
5801, Show us your badge.
5802, It's in my pocket. Relax.
5804,That nigger attacked me.
5805,He tried to rape me.
5807, Arrest him. Arrest him!
5808, I'm a cop.
5810, What are you doing?
5811, Get on the ground now!
5813,Yeah! Hit him!
5815,When you think about
5816,the fact that America
5818,"is still well over 85% white,"
5820,that America was founded
5821,exclusively by white people
5823,who wrote a Declaration of
5824,Independence
5826,and who fought
5827,"for our freedoms,"
5829,were the basis of our
5830,civilization and our culture
5832,and our Western Christian
5833,"society,"
5835,that means that the Christian Church
5836,that grew up in the world
5838,"was overwhelmingly a white,"
5839,European phenomenon.
5841,The magnificent beauty
5842,of the European people.
5844,"But today, the word ""white"""
5845,is a curse word.
5847,Ron!
5849,Anti-white.
5851,Patrice!
5853,Patrice!
5855,Hey! Hey!
5857, Stand down. Stand down!
5858, Who the fuck are you?
5860,"Undercover cop,"
5861,you fucking idiot.
5863,The black guy's a cop?
5865,Give me your keys.
5867,"Oh, my God, Felix."
5869,You're late.
5871, Felix!
5872," Patrice, are you all right?"
5874,Patrice.
5876,Felix.
5878,"Our own group, Ron and P."
5880, Mmm. I don't know about that.
5881, Go on tour.
5883,"You know, they say two Afros"
5884,"that touch together, they're."
5886, It's good luck.
5887, Who said that?
5889,I read it somewhere.
5891,"Tell me,"
5892,where'd you get this?
5894, Saw this brother on Soul Train.
5895, Mmm-hmm.
5897, Really?
5898," And I just thought, I'mma take you there."
5900, Gonna take you to California.
5901, You don't know Don Cornelius.
5903,That's my cousin
5904,on my mama's sister's side.
5906, Really?
5907," That's my cousin, yes."
5909, So I got. I got access.
5910, Yeah?
5912, What is his cousin's name?
5913," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
5915,"Who is the soul sister, Ron?"
5917,You been holding out on me.
5919,"All right, take it easy."
5920,Take it easy.
5922,Oh.
5924,"You don't remember me,"
5925,do you?
5927,Uh.
5929,Brother Kwame?
5931,Stokely Carmichael?
5933,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
5935,"You looked good that night,"
5936,but you look even better now.
5938,How often do you do that
5939,to black people?
5941,Do what?
5943,Pull us over for nothing.
5944,Harass us.
5946,Put your hands all over a woman
5947,in the guise of searching her.
5949,Call us everything
5950,but a child of God.
5952,I don't know
5953,what you're talking about.
5955,"Just like I told you, right,"
5956,he's just taking advantage.
5958,"In the end, talking loud,"
5959,saying nothing.
5961,Let me tell you
5962,both something.
5964,I've been keeping you people in line
5965,in this city for years.
5967,What I did to your girl
5968,"that night,"
5970,I could do to any of you
5971,"any time, any place."
5973,That's my prerogative.
5975,I could even bust a cap
5976,in your black ass
5978,"if I feel like it, and nothing"
5979,will be done about it.
5981,I wish the two of you'd been blown up
5982,instead of good white folks. Get it?
5984,"Oh, I do get it."
5986," Do you get it, Patrice?"
5987, Mmm. Yeah.
5989,I totally
5990,and completely get it.
5992,"Jimmy, did you get it?"
5994,"Oh, yes, I got it."
5996,"Flip, did you get it?"
5998," Oh, yeah, I got it."
5999, Chief!
6001, Do you get it?
6002," Oh, I really, really get it."
6004,You're under arrest.
6006, What?
6007, Get him out of here.
6009, Get up. Police brutality.
6010, Are you out of your minds?
6012,Let's go.
6013,"Police misconduct, sexual misconduct."
6015, Thank you very much.
6016, Keep walking.
6018, Tell it to the judge.
6019, What about my rights?
6021, Power to the people.
6022, Power to the people.
6024,The old hidden mic trick.
6026,"Yes, it was all my work."
6027,Hello.
6029,To tape jobs.
6031, Works every time.
6032, Hidden mics.
6034,"Good job, everybody."
6036,Stallworth!
6038,Ronny!
6040,Five. Four. Three.
6042,Two. One.
6044,Swish!
6046, Look who the cat dragged in.
6047," Thank you, thank you."
6049,There he is!
6050,The man of the minute.
6052,"Don't you mean ""hour,"" Flip?"
6054,"You slow, you blow."
6056,"Ah, Jimmy."
6058,"That Polaroid stunt you pulled,"
6059,"when you put your arms around them,"
6061,I swear to God
6062,I almost shit myself.
6064,"I told you,"
6065,Ron was born ready.
6067, Born ready is Ron.
6068, There he is!
6070,There's the crazy
6071,son of a bitch
6073,Come over here.
6075,"You. You, you, you, you."
6077, You did good.
6078," Nah, we did good."
6080,"Yeah, well, the Chief wants to"
6081,see us in his office right now.
6083," Let's go. Here, after you."
6084," Let's go. No, after you."
6086, Come on.
6087, You're the man of the hour.
6089,I cannot commend you enough
6090,for what you have achieved.
6092,Do you realize there was
6093,not one cross burning
6095,the entire time
6096,you guys were involved?
6098,"We're very aware, Chief."
6100,But all good things
6101,have to come to an end.
6103,What does that mean?
6105, Budget cuts.
6106, Budget cuts?
6108,And when did this happen?
6109,Last night?
6111,"I wish I had a choice, but my hands are"
6112,tied with this inflation.
6114,"Besides, there no longer"
6115,appears to be any credible threats.
6117,Sounds like we did
6118,too good a job.
6120,"Well, that's not a bad legacy"
6121,to leave.
6123,"And now,"
6125,"I need you, Ron Stallworth,"
6127,to destroy all evidence
6128,of this investigation.
6130, What?
6131, We prefer that the public
6133,never knew about this
6134,investigation.
6136,Uh-huh.
6138,Cease all further contact
6139,"with the Ku Klux Klan,"
6141,effective immediately.
6143,"That goes for you, too, Flip."
6145,This is total horseshit.
6147,Fucking shenanigans.
6149,"Aye, aye, Chief."
6151,Subterfuge.
6153, Skulduggery.
6154," Hey, Ron."
6156,Take a week off.
6158,"Take your girlfriend, Patrice,"
6159,on a vacation.
6161,Live it up a little.
6162,You worked hard.
6164,"When you come back, we can discuss"
6165,"maybe a new assignment, Ron."
6167,How about Narcotics?
6169,"Mr. Duke, I'm so sorry we didn't get to"
6170,spend more one-on-one time together.
6172,"Well, that was a."
6174,Just a tragedy.
6176,I had just met those heroic
6177,brothers in the cause.
6179,"""Heroic."""
6181,Yeah.
6183,And the chapter
6184,is just shaken at the core.
6186, Oh.
6187, Yeah.
6189,"And poor Connie, right?"
6191,"I mean, not only does she"
6192,"lose her husband, but."
6194,Poor Connie.
6196,She's looking at
6197,serious prison time.
6199, Connie's going away.
6200, We feel bad for Connie.
6202,My God.
6204,And then there was that
6205,nigger detective.
6207,Basically.
6209,Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
6210,"Shut up, shut up."
6212,Those goddamn coloreds.
6214,They sure know
6215,how to spoil a celebration.
6217,"Hey, you're getting me"
6218,in trouble.
6220,"Christ,"
6221,you can say that again.
6223,Those goddamn coloreds
6225,sure know
6226,how to spoil a celebration.
6228,"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
6230,Shoot.
6232,"That nigger detective, did you ever."
6233,Did you ever get his name?
6235,No. I don't think I.
6237,Are you sure you don't know
6238,who he is?
6240,Are you absolutely sure?
6242,"'Cause that nigga, coon,"
6243,"gator bait,"
6245,"spade, spook, Sambo,"
6246,"spear-chucking jungle bunny,"
6248,Mississippi wind chime.
6250, Wind chime?
6251, Detective.
6253,"Is Ron Stallworth,"
6254,"you racist, peckerwood,"
6256,"redneck, inch worm,"
6257,needle-dick motherfucker!
6259,Oh!
6261,I'll be here all week.
6263,What are you doing?
6265,Nothing.
6267,Finishing up.
6269,Have you handed in
6270,your resignation from the KKK?
6272,Affirmative.
6274,Have you handed in your
6275,resignation
6277,from the Colorado Springs
6278,Police Department?
6280,Negative.
6282,"Truth be told, Patrice,"
6283,"I always wanted to be a cop,"
6285,and I'm still for
6286,the liberation of my people.
6288,My conscience won't let me
6289,sleep with the enemy.
6291,Enemy?
6293,"No, I'm the black man"
6294,that saved your life.
6296, You're absolutely right.
6297, Right.
6299,"And I thank you for it,"
6300,but.
6302,I can't do this.
6304,I think we should.
6305,We should talk.
6307,It's okay. It's okay.
6309,I said it's.
6311,Blood and soil!
6312,Blood and soil!
6314,Blood and soil!
6316,Jews will not
6317,replace us!
6319,Jews will not replace us!
6321,Jews will not replace us!
6323,White lives matter! White lives matter!
6324,White lives matter!
6326,Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
6327,Black lives matter!
6329,"What the fuck, man?"
6331,You had a group on one side
6332,"that was bad,"
6334,and you had a group on the other side
6335,that was also very violent.
6337,"Nazis, go home!"
6339,Not all of those people
6340,"were neo-Nazis, believe me."
6342,Not all of those people
6343,were white supremacists.
6345,You also had people
6346,that were very fine people.
6348,Because I believe that today
6349,"in Charlottesville,"
6351,this is a first step
6352,toward making a realization
6354,of something that Trump alluded to
6355,"earlier in the campaign, which is."
6357,This is the first step
6358,toward taking America back.
6360, Whose streets?
6361, Our streets!
6363, Whose streets?
6364, Our streets!
6366,Holy shit!
6368,Holy shit!
6370,I had to jump out of the way.
6372,I almost got hit by the car
6373,my fucking self.
6375,"There are people, bodies laying"
6376,on the ground right now.
6378,"Oh, my God!"
6379,We got hit by a car!
6381,"And there was a woman, uh,"
6382,"laying there, hardly breathing,"
6384,and we ended up
6385,"rolling her over, and she died."
6387,This is my town! We did not
6388,want them motherfuckers here!
