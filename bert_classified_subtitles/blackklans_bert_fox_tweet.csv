498,"That's your real name, right? Isn't.",0
499,Isn't it Ron Stallworth?,0
500,"Right, isn't that his real name?",0
501,Can't believe he just said that.,0
502,"Well, good luck, Ron, with your new redneck friends.",0
503,They want you to join the Klan?,0
504,They want to meet me first.,0
505, They want to meet you?,0
506, Mmm-hmm.,0
507,"Yeah, well, you probably shouldn't go to that meeting.",0
508,"Good call, Sarge.",0
509,"So you're a crazy son of a bitch, huh?",0
510,"We'd have to go to Narcotics, meaning we'd have to deal with Chief Bridges.",0
511,"Yeah, I can't spare the men.",0
512,"Well, I've looked over the logs, Chief, and it seems you can spare them.",0
513,"Sergeant Trapp, Ron spoke to the man on the phone.",0
514,"All right, when they hear the voice of one of my guys, they're gonna know the difference.",0
515,"How so, Chief?",0
516,You want me to spell it out for you?,0
517,They're going to know the difference between how a white man talks and a Negro.,0
518,How exactly does a black man talk?,0
519,"Okay, Ron, what I think the Chief is trying to say.",0
520,"If you don't mind, I'd like to speak for myself.",0
521," Thank you, Sarge.",0
522, Sure.,0
523,You know what I'm trying to say.,0
524,"Chief, some of us can speak King's English.",0
525,Others speak jive.,0
526,Ron Stallworth here happens to be fluent in both.,0
527,"Okay, Ron, how do you propose to make this investigation?",0
528,"Well, I've established contact and created some familiarity with the Klansman over the phone.",0
529,"I'll continue in that role, but I'll need another officer, surprise, surprise, a white officer, to play me when they meet face-to-face.",0
530,"See, that's my point exactly.",0
531,"Chief, black Ron Stallworth over the phone, white Ron Stallworth face-to-face, so there becomes a combined Ron Stallworth.",0
532, Can you do that?,0
533, I believe we can.,0
534,"With the right white man, we can do anything.",0
535,"Anything happens to one of my men, there won't be two Ron Stallworths.",0
536,There'll be none.,0
537,You're late.,0
538,Sorry. It'll never happen again.,0
539,Seems like I heard that one before.,0

724,"Well, I meant every word I said.",0
725,"You know, I've had my own share of run-ins with niggers.",0
726,"Matter of fact, it's what led me to the Organization.",0
727, Is that right?,0
728, It's become my salvation.,0
729,"See, I was, uh, shot and wounded by a couple niggers.",1
730,Then my wife was savagely raped by a whole pack of 'em.,1

761,That's the right idea.,0
762,I've been saying this stuff for years.,0
763,"Well, you ain't the only one.",0
764,It's good to know someone else gets it.,0
765,"So, what kind of stuff you guys do?",0
766,What kind of stuff we do?,0

786,He drinks too much.,0
787,Doesn't know what he's saying.,0
788,"Just to be clear, the, uh.",0
789,The Organization is strictly nonviolent.,0
790,"Oh, nonviolent like that nigger, that dead nigger, Martin Luther Coon.",1

806,"Go ahead and, uh, fill these out.",0
807,Send 'em to the national headquarters.,0
808,"Now, once they send you your membership card, you'll be able to participate in all our programs.",0
809,Alcoa can't wait.,0
810,I love those commercials.,0
811,"Imperial tax to become a member, $10 for the year, $15 chapter fee.",0
812,Robes and hoods are not included. That's extra.,0
813,Fucking inflation.,0
814,I can't thank you brothers enough.,0
815,This means a lot to me.,0
816,Pleasure's all ours.,0
817,"You're not a Jew, right?",1
818,Jews killed Christ.,1

820,Protocol.,0
821,Course I'm no stinkin' kike.,1
822,"All right, look, we gotta ask it, is all.",0

837,They just get excited.,0
838,Yeah.,0
839, What kind of beer you like?,0
840," Coors, if you got it.",0
841,That was interesting.,0

843,They liked you.,0
844,Except for that Felix guy.,0
845,Do not ride his bumper like that.,0
846,Two car lengths.,0
847,You think he got a good look at my face?,0

849,You get the papers?,0
850,They want you to join.,0
851,"Technically, they want you to join.",0
852,Yeah.,0
853,"Yeah, they want a black man to join the Ku Klux Klan.",1
854,I'd say that's mission impossible.,0
855,Double success.,0
856,We're in!,0
857,"Slow down, brother.",0
858,Slow down.,0
859,And exactly how much should we be worried about them?,0
860,Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.,0
861,"One of the men discussed plans for a possible attack, so.",0
862,I wouldn't give him that much credit.,0
863,These guys like to boast.,0
864,What kind of attack?,0
865,"Uh, Ivan.",0
866,"Ivanhoe said ""boom,"" mentioned something about fireworks.",0
867,"But personally, I didn't buy it.",0
868,I doubt they're even capable.,0
869,"Either way, at this point, we're looking for full support from the department on this, Sarge.",0
870,Let's move on with the investigation.,0
871,Let's try to find out if they are capable of anything.,0
872,Okay.,0
873," Thank you, Sarge.",0
874, You got it.,0
875,"When we dropped Brother Kwame off at the airport, he told me that the Black Power movement needed strong sisters like me to lead the fight against capitalist oppression and the politicians and pigs who perpetuate it.",0
876,His words almost made that whole pig nightmare worthwhile.,0
877,What's wrong?,0
878,What do you mean?,0
879,What's wrong?,0
880,I don't really use that word.,0
881,What word?,0
882,"""Pigs."" Well, what else would you call them?",0
883,Cops.,0
884,Police.,0
885,Officers.,0
886,A bunch of racist cops on a power trip.,1
887,"So, you think all cops are racist?",1
888,It only takes one to pull a trigger on an innocent sister or brother.,0
889,Hmm.,0
890,Why were you at Brother Kwame's speech?,0
891,He's got some good ideas.,0
892,"I don't agree with all of them, but he's a smart brother, definitely worth hearing.",0
893,Are you down for the liberation of black people?,0
894,Do we always have to talk politics?,0
895,What's more important?,0
896,Do you ever take time off?,0
897,No. It's a lifetime job.,0
898,"Sister Angela Davis, most righteous sister, can we please spend some quality time together?",0
899,And what did you say your J-O-B is?,0
900,"Sister Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't.",0
901,Are you a pig?,0
902,Excuse me?,0
903,Are you a pig?,0
904,You mean a cop?,0
905,Are you a cop?,0
906,No.,0
907,I'm in construction.,0
908,"But more importantly, I'm a black man who wants to get to know a strong, intelligent, beautiful sister.",0
909,The very one I'm looking at right now.,0
910,You dig?,0
911,Sure enough.,0
912,That's what I'm talking about.,0
913,Power to the people.,0
914,All power to all the people.,0
915," That's right, sister.",0
916," Right on, right on.",0
917, This is Walter.,0
918, Ron here.,0
919,This is Ron?,0
920,"Sorry, your voice sounds different over the phone.",0
921,Uh.,0
922,My allergies.,0
923,Allergies acting up again.,0
924,I get those all the time.,0
925,"Listen, wanted to tell you that it was a real pleasure to have you swing by.",0
926,I think the brothers really took a liking to you.,0
927,I'm honored.,0
928,"If you're free Saturday, why don't you swing by Felix's.",0
929,You can meet the rest of the brotherhood. Hmm?,0
930,Sounds good to me.,0
931,"Well, I will see you then.",0
932,I've got a friend.,0
933,"He, uh, keeps up with these groups.",0
934,"He says they're moving away from the old violent, racist style.",1
935,"So, that's what Duke is peddling now.",0
936,"It's, uh, becoming mainstream.",0
937, Duke?,0
938, David Duke.,0
939,Current grand wizard of the Klan.,0
940,"But he's always in a three-piece suit, never seen in a hood or robe in public, and he now goes by ""national director."" So he's clearly got his sights on higher office.",0
941, Politics? How so?,0
942, Yeah.,0
943,Think it's another way to sell hate.,1
944, Keep going.,0
945, Think about it.,0
946,"Affirmative action, immigration, crime, tax reform.",0
947,Mmm.,0
948,He says no one wants to be called a bigot anymore.,0
949,I guess Archie Bunker made that too uncool.,0
950,"So the idea is, under all these issues, everyday Americans can accept it, support it, until eventually, one day, he gets somebody in the White House that embodies it.",0
951,Sarge.,0
952,Come on.,0
953,America would never elect somebody like David Duke president of the United States of America.,0
954,"Coming from a black man, that's pretty naive.",0
955,Why don't you wake up?,0
956,"Ron, hi. I'm Connie, Felix's wife.",0
957,It's so nice to meet you.,0
958,Oh.,0
959, Want to come right in?,0
960, Sure.,0
961," Do you mind if I, uh, smoke in there?",0
962," Oh, not at all.",0
963,"I'm telling you, a war's a-coming.",0
964,That'll be the end of the purified white race  as we know it.,1
965, They're right inside.,0
966,Just make yourself right at home.,0
967,It's time we go on the offensive.,0
968, We gotta make sure that everybody.,0
969," Hey, man.",0
970," Hello. Hey, fellas.",0

984," Thanks, honey.",0
985, Thank you.,0
986, Walter?,0
987, Make them remember who we are and what we stand for.,0
988,We are the Organization.,0
989, We have to.,0
990, Oh! Oh! Oh! I read something in the Gazette that this nigger named Carmichael held a rally and that some college nigger girl from the Baboon Student Union was attacking our police.,1
991,"I mean, this girl is dangerous.",0
992,"She's like that Commie, Angela Davis.",0
993,And I just.,0
994,I think we should shut her mouth.,0
995,Here.,0
996,I cut the article.,0
997,That'll be all.,0
998,"Love you, sweetie.",0
999,"Someday, you're going to need me to do something for you.",0
1000,Just wait and see.,0

1473,.and the criminal banking establishment.,0
1474,"These criminal bankers, the criminal Fed, the establishment is.",1
1475,"They're ethnically cleansing our people, not only in the United States.",1
1476,Not only in the United States.,0
1477,The only thing that we hear today from politicians.,0
1478,"You all, cross burning is off.",0
1479,"Too many cops, God damn it.",0
1480,"""Right, thank you, black people.",0
1481,"I love black people."" And, of course, every politician, every politician has to talk and genuflect to the real rulers of our society and say, ""I want to thank the Jewish people.",1
1482,"""I love the Jewish people.",0
1483,"""The Jewish people are always our friends ""no matter what they do, ""no matter how much they destroy our country.",0
1484,"""It's just wonderful.",0
1485,"You know, we just love the Jews."" And no senator or congressman would dare get up and say, ""I love white people.",1
1486,"""I love white heritage.",0
1487,"""I love my people, and I love the culture ""that was created in Europe.",0
1488,"""And this great Western, Christian civilization.",0
1489,"""I want to see that persevere.",0
1490,"""You know, I want to see that be enriched."" A lot of people think I hate Negroes, but I don't.",1
1491,"And the Organization doesn't, either.",0
1492,They just need to be with their own.,0
1493,That's what Pinky would say.,1
1494,Pinky didn't mind segregation one bit.,0
1495,She just wanted to be with her own kind.,0
1496,Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.,0
1497,You ever seen Gone with the Wind?,0
1498,Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel.,0
1499,She won the Oscar for that role.,0
1500,"You know, Best Supporting Actress, so.",0
1501,"You were Scarlett, and she was Mammy.",0
1502,That's right.,0
1503, Right.,0
1504, That's funny.,0
1505,"When she passed, it was like.",0
1506,"Well, it was like we lost a member of the family.",0
1507,A good nigger is funny like that.,0
1508,"In that sense, they're like a good dog.",0
1509,"They get real close to you, and as soon as you lose them, it just breaks your heart.",0
1510,"That's well said, Ron.",0
1511, I knew a coon once.,0
1512, Did you?,0
1513,"Yeah, that Negro lived across the street from us.",0
1514,I must have been six or seven.,0
1515,His nickname was Butter Biscuit.,0
1516,How'd he get that nickname?,0
1517,He loved his mama's butter biscuits.,0
1518,"Yum, yum.",0
1519,Me and Butter Biscuit played together every day.,0
1520,"One day, my father came home early from work.",0
1521,He told me I couldn't play with that little spook anymore because I was white and Butter Biscuit was a nigger.,0
1522,That's so rich.,0
1523,"Well, your father sounds like a terrific man.",0
1524,He was a true American.,1
1525,Taught me what was right.,0
1526,This is why we need more people like you and me in public office.,0
1527,Get this country back on track.,0
1528,Amen.,0
1529,For America to achieve its.,0
1530,"Uh, its greatness again.",0
1531,Absolutely.,0
1532,"Boy, I sure wish we had a chance to chat face-to-face.",0
1533,"In due time, my friend.",0
1534,"In due time, I will be in Colorado Springs for your initiation.",0
1535,"You're coming to Colorado Springs, sir?",0
1536,You bet your Mayflower Society ass I am.,0
1537,You're darn tooting.,0
1538,"All right, I pulled the materials that you asked for.",0
1539, Okay.,0
1540, So you just move it around like this to see the images.,0
1541,"Once you try it, I think you'll get the hang of it.",0
1542, Okay? Got it?,0
1543, Thank you.,0
1544,"Okay, I'll be at the desk if you need anything.",0
1545,Okay. Thank you.,0
1546,Thanks for getting back to me.,0
1547,"Listen, I think we need a new leader.",0
1548,Someone everyone can unite behind.,0
1549,I just don't think I'm gonna carry the votes.,0
1550,"Felix would love to be the one, but I can't let that happen.",0
1551,He's a crazy son of a bitch.,0
1552,Goddamn loose cannon.,0
1553,"No, we need someone articulate, someone. Someone who displays real leadership qualities.",0
1554,And I think it should be you.,0
1555,I gotta think about this.,0
1556,"My father, he's sick, and he lives in El Paso.",0
1557,I don't know if I can handle both.,0
1558,Sorry to hear that.,0
1559,Think about it.,0
1560,"You're a smart and diligent man, and I've got no doubt that you could handle it.",0
1561,I think it's time we get some new blood in here.,0
1562, Yeah?,0
1563, New ideas.,0
1564,"For that reason, I'm planning to step down as your president.",0
1565,But I would like to make a nomination.,0
1566,Mr. Ron Stallworth for chapter president.,0
1567,We just met this guy.,0
1568,He just walked in off the street.,0
1569,Let me ask a question.,0
1570,Is there anybody here who's willing to put their neck on the line for Ron?,0
1571,I'll vouch for Ron.,0
1572,You know who else vouches for Ron?,0
1573,Mr. Duke.,0
1574,"Look, it's a big honor, but I. I can't accept.",0
1575,"The trouble is, what you good men need is a president who will be constant.",0
1576,"On call day in, day out.",0
1577,My old man is sick.,0
1578,I just found out.,0
1579,So I'm going to be back and forth between here and Dallas.,0
1580,"El Paso, Flip, El Paso!",0
1581,Thought it was El Paso.,0
1582,It is. What did I say?,0
1583, Dallas.,0
1584," Which one is it, Ron?",0
1585,Make up your mind.,0
1586,Dallas is where the layover is.,0
1587,El Paso is where my father is.,0
1588,"Dallas, that's where they killed that nigger lover, Kennedy.",1
1589,Where you learned that?,0
1590,I can read. I can.,0
1591,"Well, we'll pray for your pop's health.",0
1592,It's him.,0
1593,"Hey, Ron, I don't share this  with a lot of people, but.",0
1594, Yeah.,0
1595,"Well, I'm anxious to meet you.",0
1596,"Excited to meet you, too, Ron.",0
1597,"Aren't you ever concerned of some smart-aleck nigger calling you, pretending to be white?",1
1598,No. I can always tell when I'm talking to a Negro.,0
1599,How so?,0
1600,"Take you, for example, Ron.",0
1601,Me?,0
1602,Yeah.,0
1603,"I mean, I can tell that you're a pure Aryan white man from the way you pronounce certain words.",1
1604,Can you give me any examples?,0
1605,"Yeah, take the word ""are."" Pure Aryan like you or I would pronounce it correctly. ""Are."" Negro pronounces it ""are-uh."" Did you ever notice that?",0
1606,"It's like, ""Are-uh ""you gonna fry up that ""crispy fried chicken, soul brother?"" You know?",0
1607,Sorry.,0
1608,Wow.,0
1609,You are so white.,1
1610,Thank you for teaching me this lesson.,0
1611,"If you had not brought it to my attention, I wouldn't have noticed the difference between how we talk and how Negroes talk.",0
1612,"Good, good.",0
1613,Yeah.,0
1614,I'd love to continue this conversation in Colorado Springs.,0
1615,"It's beautiful here, sir. God's country.",0
1616,"Well, that's what I hear, Ron.",0
1617,"I look forward to meeting you, and, uh, we'll be talking real soon.",0
1618,God bless White America.,0
1619,Come back.,0
1620," Oh, my God.",0
1621, Who are you giving the finger?,0
1622,Hello?,0
1623,It's Felix.,0
1624,Catch you at a bad time?,0
1625,"No, not at all.",0
1626,I'm just finishing a meal.,0
1627,"Meeting, my house. Now.",0
1628,"Ron, get your ass in gear.",0
1629,And don't tell mealymouth Walter.,0
1630,Welcome to the promised land.,0
1631,"In about a week's time, we'll be welcoming Mr. David Duke to our city.",0
1632," Oh, yeah.",0
1633, Who's packing tonight?,0
1634,I'm packing.,0
1635,Amen.,0
1636,"Where's your piece, Ron?",0
1637,"Well, you know, I don't carry it on me all the time.",0
1638,"""Don't carry."" No, that.",0
1639,I got you covered.,0
1640,Won't happen again.,0
1641,We're gonna need your good shot come next Sunday.,0
1642,Why? What's next Sunday?,0
1643,The war is gonna come to us.,0
1644,"Well, fuck yeah.",0
1645,Looks like we got ourselves another soldier.,0
1646,"Just make sure that when you're at the steakhouse, you got your new friend with you.",0
1647,"And, Ron, you're gonna want to name your piece.",0
1648,This is Betsey.,0
1649, Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.,0
1650, I'm sorry.,0
1651,Don't fucking point the gun at anybody ever.,0
1652,I know what I'm doing.,0
1653,I know how to use this thing.,0
1654, Honey. Do you ever have second thoughts?,0
1655, Mmm-hmm.,0
1656,About what?,0
1657,Killing them.,1
1658,Never think twice about killing niggers.,1
1659,"You won't be able to take it back, though.",0
1660,"They're the first of many niggers  that must die, honey bun.",1
1661, I know. It's just becoming so real.,0
1662,I always thought it would be like a dream.,0
1663,I know.,0
1664,It's just so beautiful.,0
1665,We're cleansing this country of a backwards race of chimpanzees.,1
1666,First the spooks.,1
1667,Then the kikes.,0
1668,"Free at last, free at last.",0
1669,"Thank God Almighty, free of them niggers at last.",1
1670,"I love it when you do that, honey.",0
1671,Mmm.,0
1672,"We've talked about killing niggers for so many years, and now it's really happening.",1
1673,Hmm.,0
1674,My old man always told me good things come to those who wait.,0
1675,Mmm.,0
1676,Thank you for bringing me into your life.,0
1677,For loving me like you do.,0
1678,"For giving me a purpose, direction.",0
1679,This could be the new Boston Tea Party.,0
1680,Mmm.,0
1681,Mr. Stallworth.,0
1682,Pleased to meet you.,0
1683,Names of chapter members?,0
1684,What is this about?,0
1685,Two names on your list work at NORAD.,0
1686,"The two mystery men, Steve and Jerry?",0
1687,Real names are Harry Dricks and Kevin Nelson.,0
1688,Two clowns with top security clearances.,0
1689,These Klansmen are in charge of monitoring our safety.,0
1690,You've done a service to your country.,0
1691,We've been following your investigation.,0
1692,Impressive.,0
1693,"Last night, Fort Carson reported several C-4 explosives missing from their armory.",0
1694, No suspects.,0
1695, Klan?,0
1696,"Wait, the KKK and the United States Army?",0
1697,"You won't see this on the news for obvious reasons, but thought it might be of interest to you.",0
1698,"If you know about a possible attack, I need to know when.",0
1699,You're the one with the impressive investigation.,0
1700,But can't you or the FBI chip in?,0
1701,Sir?,0
1702,FBI?,0
1703,Federal Bureau of Investigation?,0
1704,We never had this conversation.,0
1705,"You can hate me all you want, all right?",0
1706,Just promise me you won't go to that protest.,0
1707,I'm going. We're going.,0
1708,What are you talking about?,0
1709,"I can't get into specifics, but today the Klan is planning an attack.",0
1710, Then we have to tell the people.,0
1711, It's not an option.,0
1712,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1713,What's wrong with you?,0
1714,No one else can know while it's an active investigation.,0
1715,Active investigation?,0
1716,"And pray tell, how do you know that?",0
1717,Are you a pig?,0
1718, No.,0
1719," What are you, then?",0
1720,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1721,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1722,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1723,Want to sit?,0
1724,No. I'll stand.,0
1725,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1726,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1727,I'm an undercover detective.,0
1728,I'm investigating the Klan.,0
1729,Fucking KKK?,1
1730,"Ron Stallworth, you lied to me.",0
1731,Is that even your real name?,0
1732,Ron Stallworth is my first and last name.,0
1733,"Look, today is not the day, Patrice.",0
1734,I take my duties as the president of the Black Student Union seriously.,0
1735,"Well, how much good did it do?",0
1736,"You could sit in the middle of Nevada Avenue, light yourself on fire, the KKK will still be here.",0
1737,"Well, at least I would be doing something, unlike you.",0
1738, Unlike me?,0
1739, Yeah.,0
1740,"Don't think, just because I don't wear a black beret or a black leather jacket, black Ray-Bans, screaming, ""Kill Whitey,"" that I don't care about my people.",1
1741,"The night we saw Brother Kwame speak, were you undercover then, too?",0
1742,That's not fair.,0
1743, You have to understand.,0
1744, Answer the question.,0
1745,Were you undercover the night we met? Yes or no?,0
1746,"Ron Stallworth, are you for the revolution and the liberation of black people?",0
1747,I'm an undercover detective for the Colorado Springs Police.,0
1748,It's my J-O-B.,0
1749,That's the truth.,0
1750,"House niggers said they had a J-O-B, too.",0
1751,You disgust me.,1
1752,"My brother, you need to wake up.",0
1753,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1754,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1755,Are you fucking kidding me?,0
1756,You don't cross those lines.,0
1757,"This is about an investigation, not a relationship.",0
1758,Hate to break that blue wall of silence.,0
1759,Nice one.,0
1760, Is Patrice really in danger?,0
1761, Maybe.,0
1762,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1763,"Ungawa, Black Power!",0
1764,It's off.,0
1765,Yep.,0
1766,You'll know soon enough.,0
1767,What?,0
1768,Felix just said the march has been canceled.,0
1769, Why?,0
1770, Could be all the death threats.,0
1771,"No, they're used to that.",0
1772,And there's been nothing more about the explosives?,0
1773,No.,0
1774,Fuck it.,0
1775,We get them on weapons charges and stop them from doing anything that way.,0
1776,"Then what? You know, misdemeanor at best.",0
1777, Then they walk.,0
1778, I have a special assignment for Ron.,0
1779,Ron already has an assignment.,0
1780,"Yeah, what could be more important than preventing an attack, sir?",0
1781,We have very credible threats against David Duke's life.,0
1782,"So, Ron, I am assigning you security detail  for David Duke.",0
1783, What?,0
1784,"With all due respect, sir, I don't think this is a wise decision, given the situation.",0
1785,Who cares what you think?,0
1786,Duke needs protection.,0
1787,There's no one else available.,0
1788,Nut-cracking time.,0
1789,Put aside your personal politics.,0
1790,"Chief, it's not about that, and you know it.",0
1791,David Duke and Ron have been talking on the phone several times.,0
1792,If he recognizes his voice.,0
1793,"If any of the Klansmen do, it'll compromise our entire investigation.",0
1794, It's too dangerous.,0
1795," Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you boast to me that you were fluent in both English and jive?",0
1796, Do you remember that?,0
1797, Answer the Chief.,0
1798,"Oh, shut the fuck up, Landers.",0
1799,"You know, you've been trying to sabotage me since day one.",0
1800,"Why are you getting so worked up, boy?",0
1801," Hey, Ron!",0
1802," Hey, Ron, come on.",0
1803," Ron, Ron, no! Ron!",0
1804, It's not worth it.,0
1805," Okay, okay, all right.",0
1806, Just.,0
1807," Go, go, go.",0
1808, Stay put.,0
1809," Ron. Whoa, whoa!",0
1810, What the fuck is that?,0
1811,"Gotta bring something to get something, Landers.",0
1812,Eat a white dick!,0
1813,You let him get to you that easy?,0
1814,You don't have a shot with David Duke.,0
1815,"First, the primary target.",0
1816,Felix says you're doing it.,0
1817,"So all you have to do is set the pocketbook on the front porch, the back porch, a sidewalk.",0
1818,Doesn't matter.,0
1819,"As long as it's against the building, you can plant it anywhere.",0
1820,I got enough C-4 here to take out the whole thing.,0
1821,Be careful.,0
1822, You understand?,0
1823, I understand.,0
1824,All you have to do when you placed it.,0
1825,"Hey, sweetie. You listening?",0
1826,All you have to do when you placed it is flip the switch.,0
1827,Flip the switch.,0
1828,That's it.,0
1829,You got it?,0
1830,Miss Black Student Union Bitch is bringing in some old coon to speak.,0
1831,Place should be packed.,0
1832,"So, Brother Walker, nothing but rubble.",0
1833,And barbecued niggers.,0
1834, And what happens if that don't work?,0
1835, Plan B.,0
1836,"Can you handle it, honey?",0
1837,You can count on me.,0
1838,I've been waiting to do my part.,0
1839,Sweet as candy.,0
1840,"Ah, look at the lovebirds.",0
1841,Can I feel the C-4?,0
1842,No C-4 for you.,0
1843,You'll blow us all the fuck up to kingdom come.,0
1844, What is this black.,0
1845, Out here with  the great David Duke.,0
1846, Look at this fucking guy.,0
1847,How's he getting away with that?,0
1848,Mr. Duke's security detail.,0
1849, What?,0
1850, Fuck this guy.,0
1851,Mr. Duke.,0
1852,I'm a detective from the Colorado Springs Police Department.,0
1853,I'm here to keep you safe today.,0
1854," I'm sorry, have we met before?",0
1855, Mmm-mmm.,0
1856,You may know that there's several credible threats against your life.,0
1857,How's it going out here?,0
1858,"There have been threats on my life, and this is the detective they've assigned as my bodyguard.",0
1859,"Mr. Duke, I don't agree with your philosophies.",0
1860,"However, I'm a professional, so I will do everything within my means and beyond  to make sure you're safe.",0
1861," Okay, I appreciate your professionalism.",0
1862,"Allow me, sir.",0
1863,Thank you.,0
1864," Right this way, sir.",0
1865, Walt.,0
1866, Bro. How are you?,0
1867, Sir.,0
1868,Sorry for all the extra security today.,0
1869,Can't be too careful.,0
1870,"Yeah, I know.",0
1871,"We have a strong, strong.",0
1872,"Hey, fellas.",0
1873,"Yeah, like you were saying, last week on the phone.",0
1874,"Well, Mr. Duke.",0
1875,"I would like you to meet our newest recruit, Ron Stallworth.",0
1876,"Ron Stallworth, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person.",0
1877,Same. Same.,0
1878,You as well.,0
1879,"This is our brother, Jesse.",0
1880, I'm Jesse.,0
1881," Hey, Jesse.",0
1882, Ron.,0
1883," Ron, yeah.",0
1884, I've heard so much about you.,0
1885," Oh, okay.",0
1886,I didn't realize how nervous I was gonna be.,0
1887,That's all right.,0
1888,What's that doing here?,0
1889,That's the fucking cop they got to guard Mr. Duke.,0
1890,Isn't that the living shit?,0
1891,"Gentlemen, it's time.",0
1892," Ron, why don't you follow me?",0
1893, Okay.,0
1894,Let's go. Let's go.,1
1895,You stay right here.,0
1896,You hear?,0
1897,"God, America's going to hell in a handbasket.",0
1898,"That started out as a nice spring day back there in Waco, Texas.",0
1899,"May 15, 1916.",1
1900,Jesse Washington.,0
1901,Was a friend of mine.,0
1902,He was 17.,0
1903,I was 18.,0
1904,We kind of looked at Jesse and called him slow.,0
1905,"Today, you'd call him mentally retarded.",0
1906,They claimed Jesse raped and murdered a white woman by the name of Lucy Fryer.,0
1907,"They put Jesse on trial, and he was convicted by an all-white jury after they deliberated for only four minutes.",0
1908,"My brothers in Christ, Nobel Prize recipient, co-creator of the transistor and a dear, dear friend of mine, Dr. William Shockley, whose groundbreaking scientific work ushered in the computer age, has proven, through his research with eugenics, that each of us here has flowing through our veins the genes of a superior race.",0
1909,It's a fact.,0
1910,It's a fact.,0
1911,It can't be disputed.,0
1912,"Today, we celebrate that truth.",0
1913,"Masks off, hoods on.",0
1914,I was working across the street at the shoeshine parlor.,0
1915,"And after the verdict, a mob grabbed Jesse, put a chain around his neck and dragged him out of the courthouse.",0
1916,"Oh, my God.",0
1917,I knew I had to hide.,0
1918,That way.,0
1919,"Be careful, brother.",0
1920,"Well, all right.",0
1921,"Where I was, the shoe parlor had a window up in the attic.",0
1922,And I could see the crowd.,0
1923,They marched Jesse through the streets.,0
1924,They stabbed him and beat him.,1
